riding an electric scooter the last ~100 yards to my hotel. i used the "free" uber jump electric scooters while on a business trip this weekend. hotel was a mile or so from the riverwalk, and rather than uber, cab or walk? i thought i would take advantage of the free promo uber was running on their jump scooters. first time was awesome. opened the app, scanned & zipped back to the hotel in no time. next day, i grab another one. showed a half charge, and i scan and jump on. works fine for a minute or two, and then went into turtle mode. i'm going like 2 mph. snails are calling "on your left" and laughing at me. end the ride and grab another scooter. works for a few minutes and then turtle mode. *sigh* i swap again, file a help mode complaint, and try a third. this one mostly works, and i finally get where i am going. that night, going from one event to another, i decide to be lazy, and rent another scooter. everything is working fine until i try to end the ride. there is an error and now uber thinks i am somewhere in africa... close and reopen the app a few times, try calling, and file a complaint. after 5 minutes + of messing with it, the ride finally ends. i'm not drinking alcohol at any point, because a. i have a screwed up throat (which is a whole other tifu saved me life type story) and b. trying to lose weight. later that morning after the event is over, i grab the required whataburger late night /early am meal. when i leave, i try and find a scooter, which previously had been easier to find than outrage on tumblr. none to be found. i do find a few of the bikes, but none of them will even turn on. my battery is low, so i don't want to try and download another app. i decide to suck it up and just walk back towards the hotel. this sucks, but oh well. i figure i will find one on the way. no jump/uber scooters to be found. lots of red razor scooters, which look just like the uber/jump scooters. several bikes, which won't turn on to sync up and be scanned/used. i walk almost all the way back to the hotel. i'm maybe 100-200 yards from the hotel when i see the holy grail of a jump scooter. my feet hurt, i'm tired, and strangely excited to use the scooter for that last push. scan, and everything syncs up and the scooter activates. hooray, right? the damn thing starts to work, and then turtles as i am crossing the i-35 access road. and then proceeds to take off like the infamous darwin awards jato rocket car. until the wheels lock for a second and i prove newton's first law of motion still works at 3 in the morning. i go flying, and even though i get my hands out in front of me, proceed to face plant into the cement. i feel my front teeth crack apart, my glasses go flying, and my nose looks like the aftermath of a mma fight. i'm laying there bleeding on the sidewalk, and thinking that the old irish blessing of "may the road rise up to meet you" is a curse. i get up, resist the urge to hurl the death scooter into the first dumpster i can find. i hobble back to the hotel, where the front desk immediately calls an ambulance. i'm bleeding everywhere, and get a good look at my busted grill and nose. lovely. the hotel was great. they charged my phone, and let me call jump/uber. they ask if i've gotten medical attention, and ask if i have filed a police report. they seemed much more concerned with the latter than the former. they tell me they have escalated my case and they will get back to me when the team is back in. paramedics and fire department shows up. while i was tempted, i didn't burn the scooter. they ask me a few questions, tell me that the scooters are the work of the devil, and they have seen a ton of accidents and taken people to the emergency room. they also tell me that i am probably screwed as the fine print says i accept all liability before riding. the paramedics tell me that i am probably ok, and that if i go to the er, they will just check my vitals and send me home. they tell me that if they check my vitals, i will be charged, and that i probably don't need it and it would be a waste of money. awesome. they advise some ibuprofen and seeing my doctor, a dentist and filing a police report. i thank them, and call the police and then call the jump team again. i try and get advice on what i should do, and get the corporate "i can't tell you what to do, but the case has been escalated". police officer writes the report and tells me again, he's seen nothing but problems from the scooters. i specifically ask him to give me a field sobriety test or a breathalyzer to try and make sure i have some way to prove i am in no way impaired. he says he can't, but he can tell i'm not. after all of this, i'm exhausted and covered in blood with a busted nose, and two broken teeth. the hotel gives me some motrin, ice and water. i go back to the room, scrub up and take the meds. today i get to go see how bad the dental work will be, and how much out of pocket i will be. once again, crappy luck shuts down the nintendo switch or xbox one i was planning on getting. üéâ tldr; staying at a hotel off the riverwalk $96.00 using an uber/jump scooter: $free ruined leather jacket: $200 bloody, scratched up glasses: $300 paramedics bill (even though i refused treatment and didn't call them?): ~$500 messed up hip: $$$$ dental work: $2-3k ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?

i'm clueless i always felt like i should know more than i should, and it bothers me that i can't talk to people because i have almost nothing relatable to talk about. i don't have the same experiences as most people and nothing really exiting going on in my life, i don't have instagram cause i know i wouldn't use it, and i rarely use snapchat because i don't have the motivation to use it more. i mostly don't really know what people even talk about and makes me feel so crestfallen ‚òπÔ∏è	0

falling asleep on a long school trip so, ive been on a grueling 3-day trip with a bunch of kids from my grade touring different colleges, and today is the final day, were getting back home at around midnight. so im tired af, literally, sleep wasn't exactly something you do when roomed in a hotel with your friends. anyway, as i said earlier were heading home rn, its like a 7 hour drive, and since im tired i decide to sleep. didnt think much of it. i wake up, find out were about to drive into a burger king, nothing special. and then, i check my snap to see multiple friends of mine sent me videos of the absolutely oof way i fell asleep. my legs were sprawled out, my head completely up to towards ceiling, mouth wide open. it was bad. my panic slowly crescendos as i watch even more and more friends tell me about the way i was sleeping. just making jokes about it and all that. it got worse when i started hearing other students, that i dont talk to, talking about a dude that looked funny while he was sleeping. neato. it gets worse. after all of the realising everyone was nonchalantly making fun of my sleeping position, i realised my literal ex was sitting less than a foot away from me. yee yee kiddos: oof. its been kind of a petty anger towards each other for about 2 years now so i know she had to have taken pictures and probably sent them to other people. so thats my story. thanks for listening. üòÖ tl;dr: i fell asleep looking like an idiot and literally everyone noticed it including my ex	0
my friends are all hanging out without me after we intended to hang out tonight. it's the first day of summer and we had plans to hang out, and they all got together without me, with some other friends who i also tried to hang out with and they said they were busy. life is good! ü§ó /s	0
suicide being logical?first of all: apologies for my english. didn't really speek it since i graduated from school last year. does anyone know the idea of suicide being kind of logical, when it's like the only reasonable way of thinking about your future? since i've gratuaded from school last year i tried to work in a supermarket and started to study a subject which i really liked at that time. started with my driver's licence, too. first, i stopped working because i got more nervous (and tired at the same time) with every shift. then i skipped more and more classes at my university and eventually stopped going there at all. around that time i got my driver's licence, but due to me being nervous i never got to drive that much to get some practice. i basically cut off every "duty" that forced me to leave the house and interact with people and therefore it developed into a cicle and my "anxiety" (souds kind of weird to use this term, but i can't find a better description of being extremely worried about everyone and everything and having no energy to do something about it at the same time) got even worse. now i'm starting to meet friends more often again and i made up a plan of other classes i could visit at my university (e.g. to change subjects), but now i've got chest pain which makes it nearly impossible to work out and my motivation for visiting other classes slowly fades away. i'm more and more aware of the fact that everything i put my energy into basically goes to shit in the end. no progress in working out, still not a sign of social skills or self respect though i try to interact with friends (or even strangers) as much as possible. i think i let my parents down every time i don't have the energy and/or courage to do something important (although they seem to be interested and understanding they're both extremely stressed at the time). never had a girlfriend at the age of 19. had this, whatever it was, with a girl for about 1,5 years, in the end, she was just disappointed and i was hurt and felt kind of used. regular problems of a regular person, especially considering my age, but i feel like i'm simply to weak to live with it, let alone do anything about it. to be honest, i just can't see me overcoming those "fears" or "problems" in the near future. finding a subject i'm interested in, get a nice body, lose my fear/stress about everything/everyone, get a healthy relationship. i just can't imagine me being capable of solving any of these problems. i may sound like an extreme coward (atleast that's what i think it seems like), but before i hurt/disappoint anyone else or get hurt/disappointed (mostly by myself) once again, i think it would be the best - and in this case most logical - way to just end it when there's no sign of something getting better in the near future. i'm not even whiny or over-emotional at this point (which i'm often enough, believe me), it just sounds like the least "annoying"/stressful way to solve all my problems at once. üññ	1
endin my shitall my life i've been guilt tripped by both parents and i didn't even know. it's super draining waking up in the morning and getting shit because i'm not smart like my brothers are or being told to leave everyone alone because i'm annoying. i was constantly told i was the reason why they fight and they would somehow they would always get my other siblings to add onto giving me shit with them. and now i've had enough. i'm tired of them controlling how i feel and how i live but there's really nothing else i can do. i'm not legally able to leave my parents and live by myself cuz i'm not old enough. and so i'm just gonna take some of those sleeping pills and wish for the best. no more getting told that i'm an idiot. no more of hearing them argue about stupid bullshit that only inflate their egos. no more fucking stress. ‚úåÔ∏è	1
i just realized that i'm in love with my female friendüòç so me and this girl have been hanging out for quite a while now. we've always gotten along really well. we've literally been spending our entire weekends together for the better part of a year now. when ever i hung out with her i seemed to forget all of my problems, life got less boring and i seemed to smile more. for the last 3 months i've been away from her and it's made me realize that i love her. this past month i told her about my feelings for her and we literally haven't been able to keep out hands off each other. here's a cute picture i took of her yesterday that she gave me permission to post- <url>	0
my (25f) married boss (37m) had an affair with me is threatening me. this is a doozy. i'll try and sum it up. i already know i've made terrible decisions 2019 and i've been feeling the guilt for days so no need to let me have it. i'm more curious what i now have to do in this situation and i'm relying on y'all for better perspective. üòî 4 months ago i was messaged by current boss (let's call him todd) on a networking site saying he wanted to bring me on in restaurant management. this is a place that is franchised and i go regularly as does my family to this location. he's the head chef. i was hired. throughout the 4 months he steadily flirted with me, always touching me, making comments. i never thought anything of it as he does it to anyone and he's married. todd continually texted me outside of work. when i wouldn't respond i'd get a "really?!..." or some comment about how long it took me. the job promised promotions and felt as though it was going nowhere. todd approached me one day after work for a drink at the bar, which was normal. he offered to drive me home and immediately started rubbing my leg, trying to kiss my hand. he was charming and i knew it was completely wrong. somehow we stated kissing and then i backed off, asked him what he was doing. i said "you're married." he looked disappointed somehow that i knew this and maybe thought i didn't... i asked if he had an open relationship, he said no. he asked if he said he could come inside, i said i wasn't comfortable with it and had no idea what he wanted. the job was going nowhere, and i felt i was hired by todd as his amusement because he liked my photo. this was a place i enjoyed being at though. however i felt super uncomfortable returning so i gave my notice the next day. hadn't returned since or really talk to him after. i got a text the next week and we both stupidly drunkenly met up, at his house actually. *their house.* i knew it was terrible and stupid and somehow... went anyway. i know.... that night i almost felt sympathy because he said how unhappy he was and would just stare and me and say how wished it was me and life was unfair. if he could trade places he would. he wanted to change his situation and wished i was his girl instead. (blah, blah.) i didn't ask him any questions or ask him to say any of this but it felt like he was just confiding in me. i simply responded that i'd meet him where he was at with this. it felt like he genuinely confessed something to me. **here it goes:** the next week i heard nothing from todd. when he's always texting me. i said we should meet and talk. he said there's nothing to talk about. i said we should just go over it. he said it's not complicated, don't over think it. (*dating a married man isn't complicated okay*) he kept ignoring me the next week. i finally called, and said if he feels like this i'm not just a booty call and it would've been nice to hear from him. he totally shut down and responded by saying he has no time for me and kept yelling at me saying "i expect answers like i'm in 12th grade" and to get over it. he then messaged me saying he felt sick to his stomach and i deserved the world. i couldn't keep up and i'm still confused rn tbh. he sent me a text just now saying something like he's 'going to block my number, if i ever contact him, if i ever see him again, if i ever go to his place of work, he has friends and cousins who are members of the police. and he will contact his friends' ???? this is a place i visited. worked. had parties at. i'm still owed money from the bar. i feel like i'm being harassed and threatened into never showing up again when he has no grounds to do this. he has only worked there 8 months. i did for 4 of them. it's like i was just hired as amusement and used. i've accepted we both obviously made bad choices here. but now it's like i'm being silenced and harassed. i think he's just afraid of his wife knowing obviously. i'm not sure how to approach this, or even how to return to this place, for my money or parties as usual. as the other woman i've been feeling like absolute shit. and would the wife even want to know...?!! any advice is welcome.... **tldr;** married boss hired me and hit on me and we hooked up. i quit and am still owed money from work and he's threatening me into never returning.	0

i've reached that point in my adulthood where i can no longer sleep in i'm 21 now, so i know i'm not old at all but when i was at least 2 or 3 years younger, i can sleep all the way til noon on a weekend, especially at this point where i'm not in school for the summer. but now, since over the past couple years of waking up at 7:30 am to get ready for work, i've managed to adapt to waking up at the first glimpse of sunlight and my body is ready for the rest of the day. on the bright side, i have no need for an alarm clock. last night i stayed up late knowing i want to sleep for at least a couple extra hours compared to usual since i'm off on weekends (substitute teacher perks). i spent the night out and came home at about midnight and fell asleep around 2:00 am. at least i can make it to the gym in the early hours now üëçüèº	0

tifu by getting the police to smash the neighbours front door down i have new neighbours. we didn't really get off to a good start. we introduced ourself when we saw them half way down the street once but we realised they were mid domestic argument so walked away as it was pretty awkward. since then they never said anything to us and sometimes we all arrive home at the same time and it's a race to see who can get there door open faster in order not to have to acknowledge each other. i should mention they have a dog. they're out a lot and we never hear the dog apart from the sporadic bark. however, tonight for over an hour the dog was howling. a constant high pitched howl that sounded like he was hurt. there lights were on so i figured they were home. dog is still whimpering and howling and i hear what sounds like a female screaming. i am now convinced the lady next door is hurt and the dog howling at her side. i knock on her door a couple of times but no answer. my partner calls the police and they turn up. i tell them i'm worried. they have a look through the window and said the place looks ransacked. then.... they just booted the door down. completely of it's hinges, glass everywhere and guess what?! they're not in. the dog was just missing its owners and they live in a mess created by them. it's going to be even more awkward from now on üò©	0

what are the common reasons for your friendships not working out? for me, i can no longer invest in a friend when i'm putting in the majority of the effort in upholding that connection. i can no longer stay patient with a friend who cannot hold onto the awareness of my needs. i can no longer have my time wasted due to a friend's carelessness to being late more than an acceptable length of time or canceling on me very last minute on important dates. i know what i bring to the table, not going to continue wasting my energy, time, and compassion for someone to just take so much and not give back nearly enough. i'm tired of people promising me the possibilities of their friendship only to flake and be selfish. that's my curse; i have expectations of others because i hold myself up to those same expectations. i want to give so much and wish to receive *almost* as much (i can be reasonable). oh. well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	0

when i was 11. ‚ö†Ô∏è trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è when i was 11 years old, i tried to kill myself. i took 13 sleeping pills from my grandmother and went to go lay in bed. a couple minutes later my mom came in my room to ask me if i was hungry. i was anorexic at the time, and i barely ate anything because i hated the way i looked. my mom tried waking me up but she couldn't do it, she found the bottle of pills under my pillow and apparently called an ambulance.. my doctor was screaming at me but i only remember little pieces of what happened, my heart stopped before they could pump my stomach and they got it going again. i remember looking up in the hospital bed and looking around, everything was bright but dark as-well. i hallucinated, felt sick, and was so tired for the next couple of weeks. i don't know what happened within the first three days. i was blacked out for a half of a week and had these terrible headaches for weeks after it happened. i'm 17 now and these feelings are coming back again. i don't know how to control them..	1

ruining santa for a little girl so. like most of these, this took place 2 years ago. the day after christmas. my girlfriend at the time had some good friends that just happened to have a young daughter. i think she was about 10 or 11. they had came over to play cards and to visit. my girlfriend and i lived in california but were in another state for christmas and visiting her family and friends. the night had pretty much gone crappy before this, so everyone was in a pretty bad mood. anyway. we were playing cards and talking about christmas and past christmases. and i had just kinda assumed they had spoken to their daughter about santa. like i said, she was 11 or 12, and i found out about santa when i was 8 without missing a beat, i looked at my girlfriends friends husband and said the unthinkable. "what age did you guys tell a that there was no santa and how did she react?" in a joking matter. then next few minutes are kind of a blur but i seem to remember being slapped upside my face by my ex and her screaming "they haven't told her yet" i look around at the parents, who are now mortified and staring at me...the mom kinda sighs and puts her head down...i look over at the dad and he's fuming (we were actually kinda good friends before this), and lastly i look over at the girl she was balling. but that kinda confused cry. after awhile it turned into a sob, and she quietly said "i kind of knew it. all my friends at school would tell me that their parents bought them stuff and i always wondered why no one mentioned santa" the mom quietly said "its complicated. but he is real and we'll have a long conversation about this on the way home" they got up and left. 2 months later my girlfriend broke up with me and i never saw any of them again lol ü§£ ***tl;dr*** ruined santa for a little girl a few years ago the day after christmas but in my defense, she was 11 and should have known already	0

my dad is affecting my dating life this is gonna be a long ony so feel free to skip this post. i (f19) found out my dad (m56) has been cheating on my mom(f47) for about 7 years 2 years ago. it first started out with me finding out he watched porn then realising he did 'stuff' with the lil man every morning without fail. also the reason why he practically rushes us(my siblings, my mom and i) out of the house when my mom takes us to school before she goes to work. then i discovered he has a second phone number (coz he uses a dual sim phone) that is specifically for his fuckbuddies. once he left it unattended - please don't come for me i know this isn't necessarily right - and i found sooooo many nudes from the women, dick pics, travel plans that he disguised as business plans for years. he had 4 fuckbuddies across 3 continents. my mom doesn't know and i don't know if i should tell knowing she would never leave him. she is financially independant but just can't turn on the electricity meter if it trips, she does not how check the oil in her car just simple things that she should know. i've tried to get her to do these things but she won't budge. please don't troll her please. now, i adooooooored my dad. i still do but i've lost a lot of respect. i am who i am more because of him than my mom. i seek a lot of inspiration and motivation from his story and his life. i was heartbroken when i found out about all of this. i cried for weeks. i'm kinda over it but it still affects me and my relationships. there's a dude (m22) i grew up with and somewhere along the line we caught feelings. he made lots of moves in the past year and a half and i've turned him down each time, hell knows why he's still trying. to add to my insecurities, i'm scared he too could cheat on me. i've been cheated on before and the fact that my dad has been doing this for years makes me feel like almost anyone's a cheater. again i really really looked up to my dad tl;dr basically my dad's been cheating for 7years and my parents have been married for 20. a dude has been hitting on me for sometime and i like him. i'm scared to open up because my dad was the picture of the ideal man so now i have trust issues. i also have been cheated on before. my mom doesn't know. my dad doesn't know i know. how do i deal with all the cheating?? also i'm seeing the dude tomorrow any advice on what to do. thank you in advance üíï and sorry for any grammatical errors you may find	0
okay, so, i'm really fucking mad okay, so one night i'm on my phone in my room. i get tired so i decide to put it away, i don't want to be tempted so i put it in the living room where my mom is sleeping. i wake up and check my phone, app store is gone, discord is gone, restrictions are placed everywhere on my phone. my mom tells me that she went into discord and found porn so she added restrictions. little bit of prefix to this discovery, i had absolutely nothing to do with the porn section on the discord server. meaning that my mom opened my phone, went directly into discord, switched to the porn section and claimed that i put all of it there. now i have to ask her permission to download ducking candy crush. this is such a huge invasion of my privacy and i hate every second of this torturous existence. it's so incredibly unfair and i have no one to talk to it about, so have fun reading my rant r/teenagers, i would appreciate several f's. thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è	0
didddily puff more crush stuff so recently i had a crush on this girl from a different school which i'm gonna call school b( i go to school a) i'm gonna call the girl h. she also liked me but i asked her out and she said she likes us better as friends and she's not ready to date. a couple weeks later i realized that she was actually super annoying and also as flat as a flat screen tv, and now i don't like her anymore, but she is still one of my best friends. next part of the story. i'm in the band, which is with a couple schools, i'm gonna say school a, b, c and d, but we don't really need d cause school d is gaaay. at the band trip a couple weeks ago, there was this girl there that i thought was super cute from school c i'm gonna call her o and a couple days after that she texted my other friend and said i kept looking at her. then a couple days ago, a day after i realized i didn't like h, o added me on snapchat. i added her back. she sent me a picture of her drinking water which was weirdüòÇ then five minutes later texted me saying you just gonna leave me on opened like that? i was like oh sorry... nice water! then we got into this whole conversation for like an hour straight of talking. at one point she said, "you're funny" and i said thanks you're funny too, then she waited like ten minutes which was odd because most of the conversation was like answering right away and she was like np haha thanks. she also said "we should talk more face to face cause we see each other all the time on band trips" but the thing is h was telling me that her and o used to be friends but they had a falling out because o called her fat, and i feel like if i date or am good friends with o h will be mad. but also i feel like h was in the wrong with the whole fat thing because frankly o was probably just mad at h because h offends people all the time and doesn't seem to realize how mean she is. anyway, do you think o likes me, or just w to to be friends. sorry that was long. that's what she said. tl; dr don't like old crush anymore starts talking with new crush but new crush and old crush don't like each other.	0

feeling shittyi know reddit is probably not the best place to be putting this but what the hey. i'm 18, transitioning and have a lot of problems. my mom passed 2 years ago and ever since feelings of guilt and sorrow won't leave my head. my transition is also starting to take affect on me. i've always been cool with people not using "he" and such if they don't want to, but it's starting to get to me. just my whole self is starting to get to me. i've been feeling worse and worse over the years to the point of hospitalization a couple times. i have a counselor, but i'm still stuck. hoping people who have my experience or something else like it could help üòî	1

i [20m] have never been in a relationship and i'm unsure about my feelings towards a girl i think i like [20f] i've known this girl for a good 5 years now and we've been pretty close - never really the closest of friends, but we've always had a lot to do with each other. in hindsight (and i would like to give myself the biggest facepalm) i think she liked me a long time ago. just as an example, we were on a school trip, she grabbed my hand, ran down a hill and gave me a huge hug then was super close the whole night. i don't know what's wrong with me, but i never said anything and i've actually always wanted to ask her about that. as a second example, we went to a restuarant, shared pizza and a supershake, then held hands all the way to the train. okay, so they were a few years ago and they are the most extreme examples, but the fact that i let them slide as her being nice is the source of my worries today. we had a quiet time of not really talking much after high school, but now we're back at being awesome friends and i don't want to miss an opportunity like i did in the past. she messages me a fair amount (with some üòú thrown in) and when we call, she giggles a lot which always makes me so damn happy. anyway, we sometimes hike or see a movie and last week we went to a party, then afterwards bought 24 nuggets and sat it in car for 2 hours after midnight just chatting before sleeping at her house. did i stupidly miss another blindingly obvious opportunity? i feel like i did. the thing is, she is super nice to everyone and can be flirty with most friends, so i'm still erring on the side of 'she's just being friendly and that's it'. one friend i talked to about it said that if they didn't know any better, they'd think we had a relationship. another said they've wanted us to be a thing for ages and i should bite the bullet and give it a shot. as a bonus, she must talk about my work situation a bit, because her dad offered me a job and has been nothing but the kindest to me. he called me last night to chat about work and we had a sort of father-son talk for over an hour, it was very welcome but unexpected too. their whole family seems really fond of me and always has been come to think about it. i feel like i want to ask her out, but i'm maybe being held back by a few things. one being that she is an awesome friend and i am comfortable with things as they are - being new to relationships i don't know how or when to make the next step or if i even should. second is that i'd hate to lose this opportunity to work for her dad, though i doubt that would happen. i'd also have no idea what to do in a relationship. so, i guess i'm asking as a newbie here, am i in a position to ask if she likes me? and how on earth do i manage it?? i am scared out of my mind at the thought of it to be honest, so any advice would be awesome. tl;dr new to relationships, unsure about how to go about a relationship with girl i like or even if i'm reading the signs correctly. brain is going a million miles an hour and would love some advice from someone who knows what they're talking about haha	0

sending a mother's day card i'll try to make this quick. my mom has been having a rough time lately so i wanted to do something really nice for her for mother's day even though i won't be home since i'm away at school. so i found an ad for a $30 mother's day card through instagram and when opened it pops open with hearts on a tree and stuff it's really nice and unique i thought. so i bought and sent that with a long thoughtful message that was from the heart. the message was along the lines of she does many little things that she may think goes unnoticed but i truly appreciate everything she's done for me no matter how minor. long story short i forgot to sign any names and she sent a essay long thank you saying how unique and pretty the card was and how thoughtful it was and how as soon as she got home and opened the card she was filled with happiness, the message was basically really nice and involving plenty of heart emojis. she sent that to my sister who is also away at law school but she didn't message or call me at all (which i'm fine with just as long as she is happy üíÄ). i told my sister to just go along with it so it wouldn't ruin the effect or anything by saying "oh btw it wasn't me who sent that". next time i'll sign my name also, i kinda just forgot or assumed she would know who it's from. just thought this was funny like a curb your enthusiasm episode tl;dr i sent a mother's day card to mom. i bought and sent it from college and forgot to add a clear indication of who it's from. my sister got all the thanks and we just laughed about it like it's from a curb your enthusiasm episode.	0
isnt it incredibly frustrating when someone leads you on and then ghosts you for some unknown reason. i've been talking to this french guy and was supposed to meet up in another country that's not his nor mine, just so we could finally test the waters between us, but then, 3 weeks before the flight, he just suddenly becomes busy, and confused, and whatever. anyway, i'm flying solo. might as well enjoy a solo travel üòÖ	0

alone on v-day & changing perspective on this fake holiday i'm hanging with my üê∂üê∂ and reading reddit. not ideal for the day...v-day but it is what it is. i choose not to let this day be more than what it is...thursday(u.s.). i think that today can be hard for both singles and non-singles. for single people, there is the glaring reminders everywhere in stores, tv ads, people walking who show more pda during this time, that you are alone. especially if you are newly single. it stings harder. for couples, there's added pressures about what to buy and how much to spend, how much to do for the person depending on status, time, and feelings, money, etc. pressure for proposals, jewelry, and flowers. then for both s & ns, the dreaded office flower deliveries. if you're single, well you know. if you're in a relationship of any type, it can make feel sad seeing other co-workers getting them when you don't. for men, it can make you feel guilty if you didn't get any, forgot, or can't afford to because jesus h. christ roses are stupid expensive and they die! i admit they're beautiful and i wouldn't turn them down. but for $200+, i'd rather buy a nice handbag! i really wish this fake holiday was never created. i think it would save a lot of heartache. also, a few relationships too. üòâ but it's here and i can't change that. but i can change is how i see it. instead of feeling sorry for myself. i buy myself a nice big box of chocolates. i've ever before treated myself to flowers. not at work, of course. üòâ but even if some find this pathetic, i find it much more enjoyable and it makes me happy on a day that otherwise could make me feel like shit. that's just my two cents. tl:dr: i'm ok w/being alone on v-day. i think this day can be hard for everyone. feeling alone. newly single sting. couples w/issues re no gifts, forgot the day, expecting proposals or jewelry. it's a hard day w/expectations built around a fake holiday i wish never existed. could have saved some relationships and single people feeling even more alone. just my two cents.	0

- testing out a photo booth this tifu happened the weekend and this is a throwaway because friends and family üòÇ i work for a company as a media it guy. i have been working on a project at home for a company event. basically designing a bespoke photo booth for events and having photos printed out and shown across digital screens as well. well i was at home testing out the green screen and whatnot and my girlfriend was like let's have a go, as she was dressed up in a rather nice looking batgirl outfit. so we started doing normal photos and then progressed into rather revealing photos and turning out to be a rather fun evening. the photos got printed off automatically to the built in printer. then went to bed. i then get a message from my boss in the morning informing me of a meeting and ended with a rather random bat emoji on the message. just thought i it was a typo. i get into the meeting room and my boss is there. my boss then says we have someone else joining us, and proceeded to say please send in "bruce wayne" on the phone, and then in comes my supervisor dressed as bloody batman. that's when the penny dropped. turns out while me and the girlfriend where getting busy in the photo booth it was live streaming images to the screens in the office as we took photos because of the vpn i had enables on the built in pc! while my boss was in the office on the weekend with my supervisor doing project work. i'm sat there just gobsmacked and shocked. suddenly everyone laughs and thanked me for testing the project. i'm then presented with a gift basket because i'm going to have to let the girlfriend know. she knows my work lot very well, and burst out laughing when i told her. nothing is going to happen at work which is good, they just wanted to have fun with me for a bit. but have been advised to not be that stupid again. the storage unit has been securely erased. i now join the wall of shame at work, for dumb crap done when testing projects. tl:dr tasked with building a photo booth, tested it with the girlfriend and accidentally live streaming photos to the office lab tvs.	0
suicide is not the answer i posted here this morning talking about how i've not been coping well and how i've thought about suicide but not being sure if i'd do it. well, suicide is not the answer. i completely understand how hard it is to try to carry on. but whether you feel like you have got anything to live for or whether you feel like you have got nothing, there is always someone somewhere who's life would be worse off without you in it. maybe you haven't found that person yet, but you might meet that person tomorrow, or next week, or in a years time. be excited about the future. you never know what is around the corner. you might have to struggle a bit more before you get to where you want to be in life, but that struggle will only make you stronger and it will be completely worth it. it might seem easy for me to say this because i've never even attempted suicide, but i have thought about it a lot recently. but i do know how hard life can be and it seems like sometimes no matter what people say, it seems like things will never get better, but if you really want it then they will. there will always be someone who loves and cares about you and will be there for you no matter what. stay strong, we're all in this together ‚ù§Ô∏è	1
friendship finally ended of 8yrs now they are talking about suicide (text in post)i truly wish i could explain every little detail of this from beginning to end so that i can paint a clear picture because this friendship has been a very very complicated one. the best i can do is think of all the cliff notes and put them down as i think of them. (warning: this is probably gonna be a loooooong read but i feel all the info is needed to paint a clear picture because life is complicated and can't be black and white) **also i will have the full text she sent me at the very bottom - she has multiple mental issues depression being a big one - for the past year we have been fwb - she loves me but i don't feel the same (trust me we have talked into detail and she knows "i'll never want to be with her") - she treats our friendship like we are in a relationship (this is the big kicker to me just ending this friendship outright) - she has talked about cutting and has cut herself many times - she has talked about suicide but as far as taking pills hasn't ever fully committed as she says she cares to much about her pets having no one to take care of them. (4 ferrets and 3 cats) - she lives in what could only be explained a shack with a drunk/meth head father, she is pretty much homeless but works for amazon as a driver. - i truly have tried to be there for her and help her as best i can emotionally and truly am able to blame myself for not being able to deal with her anymore - i ended the (toxic?) friendship sadly the only way it could have ended. (our friendship has almost ended several times already but neither of us went through with it in the end after i guess talking it out) how i ended it was being very distant only saying pretty much the same thing of, "its you now leave me alone" (please refer to next point(s) about this) as i knew the only way this friendship was going to end was for her to hate me. - i have tried my best as a friend to be there for her as best i can. it feels like it was never good enough. she would always apologize for acting a certain way yelling, getting mad at me, insulting me. but if i did anything wrong i would essentially be verbally abused/insulted until i take blame essentially. again it fell like she wanted to be there for her like the equivalent of a boyfriend. - everyweek for a bit over a year i dedicated one whole day to hangout with her and another day after work and i would stay with her till 10pm - i am not going to say i was perfect in this friendship but if i was not answering a text within 10 minutes of her sending or if i did not text back because there was nothing added to the conversation to actually keep it going i would always get answers back that were along the lines of (actual texts by the way) -----it doesn't matter you don't give a shit anyway -----there are so many things you just haven't answered and i have given up trying to get answers from you. because i know to you the question means nothing which is why i didn't get an answer -----im going to go die now -----should i be apologizing -----goodnight i guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's obvious enough that you don't wanna talk to me -----i feel like i should just leave you alone forever and you would be a lot happier. is that what i should do? - she talks to me about her dreams a lot almost always featuring me - our sex was ungodly amounts of good, like i am sure would make everyone jealous good and probably will never have sex that good ever again. but that was not even a single reason why i stayed friends with her. though she now thinks otherwise and has in the past sayjng i used her as a cumdumpster - i have told her and truly ment that i understand to some capacity her mental issues. (i listened to a podcast on mental illness that finally made it click for me and it was insane! no amount of videos, articles that i read ever made sense to me bu this one finally did it) - if i missed a question that she asked me while i was at work and i somehow missed it or never answered instead of asking it again i was told to find it or i got this kind of text -----no but it's fine, i just double checked you never answered my last question monday which was a curiosity question - i almost always would head over her house if she had a bad day - on her birthday i stayed the night with her cuddling as we slept as i always declined sleeping in the same bed/staying the night (i wanted to make it clear that it was out of friendship) - my hugs always made her feel better - me being around always made her feel better - i didn't have to talk to make her feel better as long as i was there holding her - i was pretty much her rock - i was finally mentally broken down from being put down over and over again if i was not this perfect friend she wanted me to be it feels like - if she was having a rough day she would essentially want me to just say something rather then nothing. but i can't just do that i can't think of what to say half the time and if i try to say something ot felt like the wrong thing and if i don't it was the wrong thing (we have discussed this before) - *my brain is racked right now ill add more as i think of them* ** the text** since i know you blocked me i figured i should just say this anyway. maybe one day you'll go into your blocked messages. i have decided not going to live anymore i have decided on how i'm going to do it, so hopefully by this time next week i will be dead. i don't know how to live in this world without you anymore, i just can't do it. if i'm successful like i think i will be, just know you mean everything to me. i was holding on because of you. all the support in the world couldn't help me once you left. you'll be getting a gift from me and i'll be making sure you get your game back with some weed for the future. the gift will prob arrive after i'm already gone. i'm sorry i couldn't have done more and i'm sorry i couldn't be strong enough without you. i would always miss you. goodbye my person, my bestfriend heart and soul.	1

i ain't looking for help honestly just wanted to get a few things off my chest. i recently came back from deployment early to burry my dad. he was a great guy, always took care of me but also beat my mom every night. i've attempted suicide before when i was much younger but as time when on i got better and joined the military just to go on deployment and come home to my dad who blew his brains out because he was an alcoholic with severe ptsd. i feel like i should join him. i have 2 weeks left in the military and i'm an alcoholic as well. i recently got a dui and was arrested. luckily my chain of command let it slide and didn't punish me because i was a good small unit leader on deployment and always took care of my guys. deep down i know i'm not a good person. deep down i have dark thoughts. deep down i'm scared. deep down is where i wanna be after i finish typing this. ‚ù§Ô∏è	1
maybe i suffer from something called visual stress maybe it's just procrastination getting the better of me so today i was on my laptop procrastinating on reddit, just doing whatever when i decided to sit down and actually do some work. that didn't last long. a small block of text into what i was doing, i was having a hard time reading this thing, harder than normal. i start thinking about that, then about why it's hard to read, (there's a whole load of small environmental factors) i notice a bunch of things, it's kinda cold, i'm tired, thirsty, there's a glare which means i have to turn up the brightness of the laptop, then i realise that's not the only thing, text is just hard to read, especially black text, like it's practically moving. then i'm like should it be acting like that so i turn to google, try to describe what the text is doing to the best of my ability (shimmering) search results are in! 'ocular migrain' ü§î no 'make text shimmer in css' nope, but that's cool so i'll bookmark that for later 'visual stress' hmm what's this? maybe let's have a look i clicked onto possibly thee most difficult to read web page i have ever laid my eyes on, light blue bold comic sans to appeal to ~~children~~ parents? this page mentions movement and jumping and a few other things about text but tbh no 'shimmering' like how i'd describe it. another much more normal and easier to read website on visual stress tells me all the things about text but also says people have trouble interpreting stairs? or something and they see colors and straight edges move (and probably acid drops are a thing or something because it's sound like people be tripping with this issue) so then i forget about it and frantically finish what i was doing. later that day yet again im procrastinating it pops into my mind again, so i google a test, and to be fair this is probably the only website on this topic that put any thought into the design of the website to actually accommodate someone with difficulty reading and better yet is also a knowledge that adults may be looking for answers. so i did the test but honestly i don't have a clue, i just wanna know is it normal for text to shimmer when your reading and now suddenly it's way easier to i read with a 'celery' overlay on text... but is this actually something wrong with me is this a dysfunction or just something that everyone experiences, and some just experience it more significantly than others (like their brain has a higher iso or something for all you photography nerds that may be reading or not reading) i'd like to believe everyone has this to some degree but then why is it so hard to find it on google, there's usually all sorts of weird nonsense on google. what are your guys's thoughts? and yes i think i am procrastinating too much	0

reconnected with my first love and things are insane. someone help! so i've broke up with my ex. we were together a long time. one drunk evening i decided to find my first love. i fbi'd his ass and found him using only his name and dob! while drunk and no other connections! lmao! no social media connections, no email addresses and no mobile number. the internet is a small and scary place ppl! background: he was scared he'd found the one, me, too young. we met when we were 22. i embraced our love and was ready for him. him not so much. would ignore me for months on end in our long distance relationship. serious ostrich syndrome. i would send him 4 page emails trying to figure out what was going on, what i'd done for him to treat me this way. to be young naive and stupid in love. i was a virgin and he respected my wishes not to have sex. he always said if i was ever waiting in a hotel ready for sex, he'd come running. fast forward to me being 26 and i'm just that... he stands me up. i vow he will never see me again. he messages me on fb telling me he's moved to the big city for me and wants to make it work. i tell him enoughs enough. now here i am 33 drunk af and i message him. i was certain he'd be married with minis running around and i want to clear the air. it turns out he hasn't and we laugh about how we both had exes who abused drugs despite neither of us even smoking. we arrange to meet several times and he cancels on the day. we met for the first time spontaneously as he kept loosing his nerve. when i saw him it was like a punch to the stomach. i don't look like i used too - weight gain yatayatayata he jumps out the car and picks me up in a bear hug. i'm 6ft and he's taller than me. we hang and it was like talking to an old friend. he tells me i'm still beautiful - my most recent ex didn't even tell me i was pretty because everyone else did üôÑ needless to say that hit me hard.. at the end of the meet he kisses me and i swear i could see the outline to his soul. he was on fire. he's the only guy i've kissed and seen fireworks. afterwards, i freak out tell him i'm scared i'm gonna fall for him. after toing and froing him telling me his head is hurting, as im battling between my head and heart, he ignores me for a week. i get in touch with him ask him to meet and then he freaks out and i offer him what he didn't provide me - patience and understanding. after me giving up and saying we need to end things he gives me a window where we can meet. we were meeting to finally have sex. we met, did it and after a couple of days he then ignores me for a month.. he says he's busy and can only meet to hook up.. i'm cool with that but i just want good morning texts.. did i get any texts? no. no, i did not. i used to tell ppl i was going to have his babies. i mentioned this to him once in passing as i never told him. i want to meet him for one last sex session as a goodbye and he wants to do it when i'm ovulating... the crazy ass! tell me what to do. this is f*cking crazy! tl;dr we reconnect, i was a virgin, when i was finally ready he stood me up. after 10 years we meet after he bailed several times - worried i wouldn't like him. we hit it off. arrange to meet, do it and he ignores me for a month.. i want a goodbye sex session and he wants to do it when i'm ovulating because deep down i know that's how he'd settle down. this is crazy.. help	0

i'm 12 a twelve year old boy, i just want to wrap a cord around my neck and die. please help me. hey, i'm just a 12 year old kid and i feel super suicidal. i just want to get out of the godforbidden shit-shack called school. i have a best friend, but every time i try to hang out with him, he sees his other best friend and i instantly become a third wheel. he says that we likes us both the same but it is just so obvious that he likes him more than me. i keep telling my parents that i want to be homeschooled and they say, "it's not what is best for you." i was searching ways to kill myself quickly and painlessly on the internet and my mom saw my history and she told me dad. that was the night i was going to end it all. my dad called on his way to work and called my mom. (they are divorced which is one of the reasons i'm so depressed, but at least thy are still friends). my dad started texting me and my mom talked to me about it. the way they were so upset and crying and begging me to not take actions is one of the reasons i'm holding back with every fiber in my body. my sister was all of a sudden so much nicer to me, so im pretty sure my parents told her. i have an appointment in about a week but i don't know if i will live to see it. :( my dogs are so happy and sweet. i love my dogs, sister, and parents the same. i love baseball and i'm very talented at it, which is one of the reasons i don't pull the trigger everyday. i spend a lot of time with my dad and we are basically best friends. i would love to spend more time with my mom, but she is depressed too and she gets upset and angry very often. i am always worried my parents will be disappointed or my sister will make fun of me if i bring home a c or lower. i almost killed my self with a cord earlier today and i had it tight around my neck for about 3 seconds when somewhere deep down inside told myself to stop what i'm doing and calm down. i hate school so much and my parents always think i'm being bullied, but the truth is, i'm not. i'm just like every other kid who hates schools, but just to a way higher degree of hatred and despise toward the damned place. i don't even cuss a lot but this subject just pisses me off so much. i'm loved by many people who i know would be upset. the thing is, i always want to commit sluiced but every chance i get, i don't even though i could spare myself of the years of torture to come with just 10-30 seconds. i'm never happy anymore and even when doing things i love i'm not happy and i just want to not be depressed and not hate school with so much anger and despair. i also have tourette syndrome which i don't think helps the situation. someone please help me! i cant take it and i need advice! üòîüòî	1

getting a vasectomy and jumping the gun before we talk testicles, let's talk teeth. "what do teeth and testes have in common", you ask? novocain. apparently, [since this incident] i read that some folks (namely gingers, me) require more novocain than other people and/or require more wait time. i recall every cavity filling requiring an additional shot however the dentist always performed a 'pre-prod check' with his instrument. patient comfort, it seems to be a thing. so, the decision came after years of my children bag balm'ing their heads, glitter bombing oscillating fans, and baby powdering living rooms - a vasectomy was in order. i should preface by saying - i'm not tough; i don't like needles, discussing blood, or surgeries. in fact, when folks tell me they are having a procedure and i must relay that story: 1) i don't listen. 2) it's relayed as: a.) they broke their clavicle b.) surgeon will be performing a hysterectomy. don't ask me why, it's the only medical vocabulary i know and retain. (they don't let me fill out employee absentee reports anymore at the office, either). ok, so we are all in agreement, not only am i not tough - i'm also an idiot. (back to the story) doctor walks in. upon the exchange of pleasantries i notice this gentleman is cross-eyed. nothing against cross-eyed folks, but if you pick your profession as a surgeon, understand that's an uphill battle. regardless, his heavy accent woos me over. german? swedish? i dunno - by now i'm intrigued by the dodgy eye and a voice in the back of my head says 'challenge accepted'. he said some other stuff, but honestly, i didn't understand and wasn't really listening. i do recall him mentioning a drug to take pre-surgery, valium, which will help calm the nerves: "yes" üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i take the valium 1hr as prescribed prior to surgery. i'm anxiously tapping my feet in the waiting room, hoping the valium will kick in or my name won't be called next. "sean?" like a dog at the vet, i'm dragged by my collar into the room. and they get to work with the novocain. this i'm told is the worst part. so i brace and feel a pinch. then another pinch for the second side. immediately, he grabs the knife and begins to cut side #1... a wave of pain i cannot describe floods my body as i'm disemboweled and burned, without any hint of novocain or valium in sight. a magnitude of betrayal only envisioned in braveheart, as sir william wallace is tortured and stretched. i long for my kilt as i scream, "freeeeedom!!!" to the other helpless lads in the waiting room. doctor: "ok. next side." the pain is reenacted, but i'm not sure if i'm on the border of fainting or the valium has kicked in, but all i can do is take shallow breaths and sweat profusely as i'm stitched back up. nurse: "you don't look so good?" i shake my head. "why don't you lay here and rest." i nod. doctor begins to wash up and head out. i ask "what's, what's the process here? when can i expect... results?" now, i'm pretty sure, i heard: "you'll need two weeks and minimum twenty-five deposits before your first test. you'll definitely want to rest for the first week." üò≥ week #1: ice, drugs, and walking like john wayne. week #2: i stare down at my stitched and bruised remains. at this point, if you've ever switched on a breaker after performing a sub-standard wiring re-assembly, put questionable foil/paper in the microwave, or given a second flush at a clogged toilet; you have a fraction of understanding what's going on in my mind. will...this...work??? hallelujah. for those of you calculating the race numbers, it's going to require (3) wins each weekday and (5) wins each day over the weekend in order to place in the poles. doctor's orders. luckily, wife will be out of town thursday through sunday, so this will be less stressful without a crew chief. queue soundtrack: eye of the tiger (x24) let's just say, worst week ever. wife returns home, "how were the kids?" "great ...i think?" (looking at me puzzled, made me realize how appropriate a vasectomy really was...) "so, i got good news. monday i can get tested." "monday? tomorrow? i thought doctor said 25?" (i explained what the doctor said.) "that can't be right, ask them tomorrow when you drop off results." so here's the deal when dropping off soldier results. you have 1 hr to get them there. so that means you're running into a hospital with outstretched arms holding a paper bag. i'm not sure what prompts the security guards to tackle you - but apparently that's not one of them. i ask the lady, (who is really surprised to see me), "what's the deal here?" "ummm, you are supposed to wait at least 1 month and have at least 25 ejaculations. you're 2 weeks too early."üòñ tl;dr - i got a vasectomy without novocain, then proceeded to speed up the normal 'break-in' procedure in double the time.	0

haven't self harmed in a while but feeling very actively suicidal.i don't really wanna elaborate too much but last december i attempted suicide and survived them a bunch of other shit happened that almost killed me. for example i got in a bus crash one week, the next week my bus barely missed a train then covid happened. i pretended to recover but i don't think i have. i have a lot of past trauma that i'm dealing with (feel free to read my previous posts and comments about it) , and i'm still living with the same person who caused the trauma. plus i'm failing all my classes, and i really want to go to college. especially an ivy league one but i don't have the money for that so i'd need a scholarship and i've already failed 2 1/2 years of high school. even though i have an iq of 128 and am told i'm smart, i'm obviously not applying myself and my mental health is really getting in the way. i also found out i have a dangerous, possibly fatal heart condition. im living way below the poverty line so i have a job however that's affecting my health but i'll be stuck in this house, more poor than i already i am, if i don't have it. i feel trapped and broken. and i'm trying to hide it, but i'm one of the few people that knows i'm not okay. or maybe i am/was okay but i'm so used to being not okay that i self-sabotage. idk but i'm really suicidal and need someone to talk to. thank you so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è also please avoid cliches	1

what do you think he (m27) thinks i (f23) think? *super lengthy post so click off if you don't want to read it rather than complaining about how long it is in the comments, but i really need advice and opinions badly! please read the whole thing* i met a man several months ago on a dating app. he was kind, and sweet. we spoke for a month before we met up (i was really busy with exams and work). i wasn't expecting him to wait that long but he did. we texted and snapchatted a ton but didn't speak on the phone cuz he didn't like phone calls...which was fine. both of us were looking for something casual and a no strings attached situation after coming out of serious relationships. i told him i didn't want to drop my pants for someone the first time i meet them so i won't be having sex the first time, he was completely fine with that. when we finally met up we had such a great time! we got along great and made out tons. he didn't want the date to end so i did go back to his place but we just rolled around in bed basically dry humping and making out. he's a guy that's slept with a lot of women. i could tell he knows how to please a woman too. again, we both wanted a very casual nsa thing. before we met but spoke a lot he told me he was falling for me (ummm...), that he'd be my date to a fam wedding of mine, that i should go to his cottage over the summer with him and his friends etc. also during the date when i went to his house i met his friends and he gave me a tour of his whole house he was proud of building. he was talking about his godson and how one day i'll meet him too. after the date we still spoke but not to the extent we use to. we'd still talk every day though (he'd mostly initiate it). i was busy again whenever he wanted to meet up and this time he wanted to meet for sex and hanging out which was understandable (i know i was being shitty here by being too busy but i did have a lot going on and it was a very tough time in my life...). plus i felt fuck buddies didn't need to meet all the time. about 2 weeks after our first date... i asked if he was down for drink that following friday or thursday night. he said he was busy with school (i knew that was a lie cuz he only has school mon-wed) but he'd let me know. he replied to my text to hang out 4 days after i sent it and he was active on social media during that time. i replied saying if you're not interested anymore that's totally fine and to let me know rather than leave me hanging... i also wished him well with school. i didn't want to end in a negative way cuz i hate that. anyways he never replied to that text so i was like okay on to the next then! he did keep watching my snapchat stories though. a month later he contacted me by sending me a shirtless mirror selfie üòÇ i couldn't help but laugh and was caught off guard. i was seeing someone else at the time casually but immaturely and rudely wanted to keep him on the hook like he basically kept me on the hook. he's very attractive and i can tell he'd be a good lay. for a good 10ish days we were back to snapping every day but i was a lot colder. i kept saying i was busy and that i'd let him know when i'm free and then he said okay let me know. i said will do and he stopped contacting again. he also stopped watching my snap stories which was unusual behaviour from him. 3-4 months later i created an instagram. somehow he was one on the first 30 people to follow me (i guess i came up in is suggested contacts or something). he likes almost all my pictures and watches my instagram stories. i know he's seeing women and doing this with them too since it's clearly evident. wtf is up with this dude? i posted a picture to my instagram story of a baked item i made and he replied to my story with the fire emoticon. i said "wow long time! thank u" and he replied "i know. been busy:(". i said same and he never replied. then a couple days later i posted a lot of pictures and videos on my story from a drunk girls night out. the last picture was my best friend and i asking "if anyone wants to go on a road trip with us let us know... we cute and we don't bite... too much ;) serious inquires only!". he replied and said let's do it! we talked for a little bit and he suggested a place to go... but the conversation quickly fizzled. lastly, he asked a while back when he can see me again and called me babe. i said not right now cuz i'm in a sticky situation but soon (i'm down for a fuck tbh).... he said no worries and he hopes everything is ok... then said let me know when you want to go on an adventure with me. i said "what kind of adventure?" and he said "outdoors! beach, cottage, camping etc." he is talking a lot more dry then he usually does and takes at least 10 hours to respond to a text.... but this is an interesting fuck bud....he said his friend has a cottage if i'm down to go! anyways that convo fizzled out too. he posted a cute picture of his dog to his story to which i replied "omg he's adorable üòç". he said "feel free to come visit he doesn't bite" and i said "will do when i have time! we have to go on that adventure later in july btw".... he never replied to that. a day later he asked me if i wanted to go to the beach that weekend with him. i said i was working till late but i'm going to my friends cottage later that weekend and will see if he can come too if it's a huge party. he was down... but my friend declined extra people so i told him he wasn't allowed and i was sorry. also to tease a bit but i was full on serious as well i was like "aaahhh damn! i was hoping this could work out cuz one of my friends and i are both bi and we all would have had a lit time! another time for sure!" he said "no worries! have fun. we will have fun in the sun when you come back. you can bring your friend too if you want". to which i said "she's more gay than straight but i'll see if she's down ;) lmao sorry for assuming things! i'm assuming you contacted me again for something casual?? if not that's totally fine too just trying to figure out where your mind is at!" now this is what i don't understand... his reply to that... help me figure it out please. *"it's cool not sure what i'm looking for. kinda want to see what happens. have a great weekend cutie"* **whatever that is suppose to mean** anyways later on he'd casually respond to some of my snapchat stories with saying "sexy" "üëå" "üî•" and even asked "whose house is that" when i was at a friends 7.8 million dollar lake house. about a week later.... i asked "so are we ever going on that adventure or...?" to which he responded "sorry been busy. i'm going to _______ the last weekend of august if you're interested" i said "sure i'm down if work permits it! i don't want to intrude on your plans :$ i'll probably bring a friend or two, how many of you are going? but i really want to do something next weekend work is consuming my life" he said "lol that's fine. not sure my friend is planning it. if your free let's hit a trail or grab a drink. i'm free. join the club all i do is work" then... i was like "i'm down! free sometime next week for drinks? what does your work schedule look like?" he didn't open the message for two days (it's on instagram).... but hes been active and then he opened it but never replied. a week after he ghosted he wasn't watching my stories either. then the weekend we were suppose to chill he started watching everything religiously again from that point on. about a month later he replied to my story asking me where i worked, saying "damn üî•" to attractive selfies but not progressing more for a couple months. he also realized i was having a party and asked when it was. i told him the date but he did nothing else to further inquire. i posted many stories suggesting i'm seeing others and he has watched all of those. now a month after my party and him religiously watching all my stories he saw a video of me rock climbing. he challenged me to rock climb with him at my schools gym?! he said "when you're ready i'll take you on ;)" and i said "maybe sometime soon! don't think you'll be ready though" he said "woah challenge accepted" a couple weeks later i posted a pretty modest nude to my instagram story and he said "damn! i wanna see more of you in the new year" i said "lmaaoo! we've been flaking on each other for over a year i think üòÇ haha!!! but yeah let's set dates i'm game üòâ happy new years eve! x!" then he responded **"i know just waiting for the right time i guess üòÇ happy new year cutie. keep up the üî•in 2019üòç". i just said "right?! you too babe üî•üëå" and that's the end of that. **why is he still interested?!** what does he think i think of him?! lol is he even interested?! **tl;dr:** sorry for the wall of text but it's hard to summarize that^ so if you have time and are bored please read! what the does this guy mean? has this happened to you? and men that do similar things, why do you behave this way? no judgement just curious!	0

my progress is a miracle!!it has been just 16 hours since i started venting in reddit and i already are desensitized to a lot of things. i can bear pain, now i even crave it, but every passing minute i am becoming more and more ready to die! i am so pathetic that i don't even have money for a gun (the best option out there) i want something effective and cutting is not lmao. it is like trying to stop breathing, you wont simply do it and even there is the risk i do it wrong. i dont have pills nor drugs nor money. hanging takes too much time and maybe is not effective. that lets me with tadaratardtarardttataaaa!!! maybe jumping from a very high building which is pretty easy, or jumping under a bus or a heavy car, although i am leaning more towards jumping. lets see how this develops üòÅ	1

i had road rage today. might need someone to talk me down because i just now had this realization; what if it was a coworker or boss who i honked at? i don't even road rage. i was having a super shit day, and after leaving work someone in a suv did something super illegal and stupid (squeezing by people waiting at a light in a single lane, passing, and cutting me off *in* the intersection) laid on my horn for a few seconds because they deserved it, but i went the extra mile and flipped them off. because fuck it and fuck them, and we'll never see each other again. unless i do!!!! ugh. listing off ways in my mind it probably wasn't someone i knew, or ways they wouldn't know it was me. üò≠	0
üá®üáøüá®üáøczech fact 4#üá®üáøüá®üáø hyperinflation in zimbabwe was a period of currency instability in zimbabwe that, using cagan's definition of hyperinflation, began in february 2007. during the height of inflation from 2008 to 2009, it was difficult to measure zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics. however, zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent month-on-month, 89.7 sextillion percent year-on-year in mid-november 2008.[1] in april 2009, zimbabwe stopped printing its currency, with currencies from other countries being used.[2] in mid-2015, zimbabwe announced plans to have completely switched to the united states dollar by the end of that year.[3] in june 2019, the zimbabwe government announced the reintroduction of the rtgs dollar, now to be known simply as the "zimbabwe dollar", and that all foreign currency was no longer legal tender.[4] by mid-july 2019 inflation had increased to 175%, sparking concerns that the country was entering a new period of hyperinflation.[5][6] in march 2020, with inflation above 500% annually, a new taskforce was created to assess currency issues.[7][8] by july 2020 annual inflation was estimated to be at 737%.[9]	0

she [23m] does not reply to my [23m] messages and things went awkward between us it just hurts. we were friends until she founds out that i like her through my actions. i caught feelings for her in the middle of our course in friendship. she already has a boyfriend. i have no plans on pursuing her and i just wanted us to remain friends. but as things progresses, its pretty obvious in my actions that i like her but i did not admit it to her that i like her. she told me that she is getting uncomfortable with me and she senses that i wanted to be more than friends with her through my actions, after i told her that i just wanted us to be friends. things started to get awkward between us, eventually we became friends again despite the awkwardness. but eventually, things went really awkward between us. she stops replying to my chat messages. whenever i try to initiate conversation with her, she just reads it and does not reply. even last night, i tried to initiate conversation with her to ease the awkwardness. but again, she just reads it and does not message back üòî i am planning to message her that i just wanted us to be friends and that things will eventually be ok between us at the end, nothing more. but i guess its a bad idea. i think she thinks i have plans on pursuing her but at the end, i just wanted us to be friends. any advice on what should i do üòî tldr: she does not reply to my messages anymore. things went awkward between us and i just wanted us to be friends at the end but she thinks i am pursuing her. any advice?	0

so i started a firefighter academy today and i wish to share something i've learned with you. never ever give up. now i know it's cliche and everything but let me tell you a little story. a year ago, in august 2017, i was one in one of the darkest places of my life. i was 70lbs overweight at 5'6 225, i'd just lost my closest aunt to a lung collapse, lost my dog to cancer and i walked on my now ex gf cheating on me. her reason? üëáüèª. now for a fresh 19 year old out of high school, this all was really really too much, as it would be for everyone. during that month there were times in which i wondered if i'd make it through the next year. my mind was full of doubt, despair and depression honestly took over. the one thing my dad has always told me and i'm now telling you is to never give up. no matter what you're trying to overcome in life, weather it's really big or small, you put one foot in front of the other and keep right on. nothing is impossible after a real kick in the ass and some extreme self reflection and involuntary help (thank you to the ff who talked to me), here i stand today. 75lvs down, pursuing a dream i'd never thought possible and working towards being a better me. i may be going through it alone without any friends or so or support base (outside immediate family ofc) but i'm determined to succeed and i know you can do anything if you put your mind to it. never give up guys. happy monday and i hope you're all having a great day (:	0

6 surefire tips to improve your relationship with your boyfriend! whether you are dating, engaged or have been married for years, losing the spark in your relationship is almost unavoidable. it is no wonder that nowadays, more and more couples are seeking counselling in order to keep the spark alive. even as you seek counsel on ways to improve your relationship, it is important to understand that your actions, thoughts and words definitely play a big role in creating a romance that works. in this post, we will be divulging 6 tips to [improve relationship with your boyfriend](<url>). #### 1. listen to each other, but remember to hear not just the words but the meaning too üì∑ the best thing you can do to ensure a strong relationship with your boyfriend is to listen when he is talking. sometimes you will notice he slips in hints about things he'd like to do, or some place he'd like to go, or something he really wants. you can save this information for later and surprise him. you could plan a date to a nice italian restaurant with outdoor tables and a nice view. or perhaps he mentions really being interested in something, you could get him a book or something related to that topic. #### 2. be thoughtful of your partner's unique traits üì∑ you will agree with me that it is very hard to find a partner who is 100% perfect. what this means is that your relationship is likely to be affected by conflict and other annoying habits. if this describes your relationship, it is important that you look for any positive traits that you like in your partner. for instance, if you have a partner who is always patient, it would be helpful to take that quality into consideration by showing a little appreciation for their patience. showing your partner that you appreciate their unique qualities is a great way to make them feel special. #### 3. propose to create a ritual for your relationship üì∑ after having been in a marriage for 10 or over 20 years, it is very hard to still have the same high level of enthusiasm that you had when your relationship started. lack of enthusiasm can be quite scary, but as a couple, you can propose to create time for practices that will bring that passion back. for instance, you can aim to strengthen your bond by regularly having breakfast in bed together, having saturdays as your regular date nights, checking in with each other every other day, the list is endless. #### 4. have a phone-free hour every day üì∑ with the social media craze is going on, you will agree with me that phones are a big let down to relationships. if you are really looking to improve your relationship, then you must learn to tame your habits in as far as your phone is concerned. as a couple, it is advisable to keep your phone away for at least one hour or two every day and use that time to maximize your affection. #### 5. try new things together üì∑ if your old habits are kind of boring, try out new activities together. incorporating new enjoyable activities in your to-do lists is not only exhilarating, but it also tends to help you as a couple develop a new attachment to each other, and helps to further glue your relationship. playing online game together in the privacy of your own home could be one such new activity. all you need is to give him a promotional betting bonus code which you had collected earlier to avail bonus money while registering at the site. this new activity is a surefire tip to bring him closer to you than ever before. #### 6. show respect for each other üì∑ for romance to thrive, both partners need to highly respect each other. couples should make it intentional to respect their significant other because failing to do so only puts their relationship down to a lower level. it is important that each partner makes it his or her responsibility to fix issues and respond to partner's desires and needs without being disrespectful. respect in a relationship should be equal from both sides or it will likely cause conflict at some point. here are nine signs of an equal relationship. source: [newszii.com](<url>)	0

casual thoughts about wanting to die. every morning for the past 6 months i've woken up thinking what a relief a bullet or noose would be. i don't know if i'd have acted on it if my parents didn't love me so much and i didn't have debt. do a lot of seemingly happy people have suicidal thoughts? i don't have anyone to talk to about this. no way i'm going to a counsellor. anonymity of internet is so comforting. i don't know if this is a cry for attention or just me being unable to cope with the stress that everyone expects me to be able to cope. feel lighter just typing this. üôèüèΩ thanks.	1
this post is just me becoming self aware. i still can't get over this- also sorry for my crap story telling skills, i love writing but rn my brain just bleh so on friday on the bus to school, some kid (i only heard their voice) made a "if you ____ ur mom's a hoe" joke (i forgot what the joke was üòî) and so i like laughed right? and this 6th grader looks at me so genuinely fucking shocked, and says "did you just **laugh**." then maybe about a month ago on the bus this kid looked at me and was like "do you talk?" and i was like "mhm" and he was like "oh shit" then about three months ago when i was walking to my seat (again on the bus) this one dude in my grade was like "yeah coryn ready for friday??" and i didn't know how the hell to match this dude's energy so i just nod and continue to my seat and this one kid's like "i don't think she's very happy." in conclusion, i'm just now realizing that everyone at my school besides my friends probably think that i'm a depressed mute kid. .__.	0

scarring myself with my cousin's nudes. it actually happened years ago, when i was still innocent and very young. but i didn't have enough courage to tell anyone because nobody has seen their cousin naked and i knew for sure that it was not normal. i was at some relative's wedding function who i don't know. my newly wed cousin and her husband took me there. i asked my cousin's husband(idk what to call him) for his phone because i wanted to play games. i was still innocent and young and didn't know what was going on when she looked at him and said something with 'eye-language'. but now i doüò•. he gave me his phone nonetheless because he was dumb af and kinda bored of me bothering him. i got into some intense gaming. i got bored. opened gallery and boom. it didn't hit me at first as i thought it must some kind of dress. i've tried many things to make me forget that. this event has certainly made me grow up to be very awkward and naive around girls. i did not tell anyone until now. tl;dr: wanted to play games on my cousin's husband's phone. eventually got bored and opened gallery, just to witness my cousin's nudes.	0

so i am not sure what can i do in this provincial i'm staying at my parent's home as it is boring as heck. and problem is i have no friends in real life as in who are someone "fun" to talk. just literally no friends to call over phone. i want to do something as fun but i have no idea what to do. no activities around me, nowhere to go etc etc. as someone who never goes to parties and such, i am already fine with staying at one room at the home. the only thing i can do in our apartment is swimming but when i stay in the pool long, my head is starting to ache. also as someone who has a terrible sa, i cannot go out. tried to go out walking, but i have an allergy to walking. any advice is welcomed definitely üòï	0
my boyfriend [23m] and i [23f] of 5 years is at a crossroads. we have a lot of love for each other but i have trust issues, and i can't be my best self feeling like this all the time. i've dealt with the same shit over and over. i stick around because we have a bond, best friends since we were 11 years old, dating since the end of high school. but he constantly crosses the line with me and i think i make my boundaries very clear. (flirting with girls, commenting 'üòç' etc., i've looked through his phone before, and personally don't like what i see) but there's always a good reason for his actions according to him and thinks that being transparent with me is enough. i feel stuck in a loop. he's admitted he would be upset if the roles were reversed. he's also says he is consciously aware i won't appreciate certain shit but thinks it's not a big deal. he claims it's nothing but innocent friendships and it's normal for babe and boo to be thrown around. and apart of me is ready to let go for the benefit of the both of us. but we get to having a discussion about breaking up and it ends up with us both crying lol and then wanting to just have sex. it's so fucked up because at the end of the day, i think that behaviour is wrong and he's aware cause again, he admits he wouldn't fuck with it. regardless of how the convos go, i remain firm with where i stand, but then it's just apologies galore. so i'm just thinking he wants to be ready but can't be right now. it's like 5 years man come on, but i don't know what to do.......i feel so confused and sad lol tl:dr - me and my boyfriend of 5 years are at a crossroads. trust issues are evident but it's so hard to figure out the best thing to do	0

do you celebrate your birthday? are birthdays a big deal for you reddit guys and gals? i turn 23 today and its been pretty lackluster all around. haven't gotten too much love aside from the family and a few buddies. usually some old friends come out of the woods and say what's up, but not a single one this year. no joke the person most excited to learn it was my birthday was one of our apartment complex's maintenance guys. i've lived here for 2 years and we've gotten pretty friendly. he really lit up when i told him and gave me a hug, it was wholesome as shit. laz you're that dude. aside from that, it's also my roommates birthday, coincidentally. we both have exams tomorrow (med school) so i wasn't inclined to go out tonight to celebrate, but he did with some of our buddies. i was cool with just chilling ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. so, what about you? do you celebrate birthdays or is it just another day?	0

looking for others like me! hey guys, i'm new to reddit, and this sub. i've heard the community at this subreddit is great, so that's why i'm posting here. i'm a 21 year old guy, very awkward, and quite shy. i can't seem to hold interesting conversations with people, have trouble maintaining eye contact and tend to generally fuck up as a result of my social awkwardness (check out my post on tifu, if you like). so, i've sometimes wondered if i was stupid, but i don't think i am, as i do well enough in my studies. but for some reason, talking to others is like the hardest thing for me. i just don't know what to talk about, and will eventually run out of topics (to talk about). as a result, i don't have many friends, but the ones i do have, i treasure. i'm wondering if there are others out there like me, or worse than me. perhaps we could have a chat (private messages are welcome). üòÉ	0
here's how you prevent someone from killing themselves i'd like to add something here for those who don't understand depression and suicide. forgive me if i sound a little bitter, but right now i am suicidal. what was my breaking point you might ask? well, the love of my life broke up with me. he won't forgive me for the mistakes i've made. he knows i've been depressed and suicidal, but continues to ignore my texts and calls. he makes me feel like the lowest of the low, like i don't matter. so maybe if anyone is reading this and is dealing with someone who is depressed and suicidal--don't ignore them. don't yell at them and say it's their fault. don't call 911-the mental hospitals will only make them worse, not better. please don't suggest suicide hotlines, therapy, and medication. maybe, just a thought--be nice to them! treat them with love, kindness, and respect. make them feel like they have a place in the world and that they are worthy and deserving of love. i'm on my way out because nobody gives a shit and i'm tired of everyone being mean to me all the time. so i'm hoping i can save someone else and leave my mark before i go because i'm so fucking done with this world. people are horrible. so please, don't be a horrible person. be loving and kind and understanding. acknowledge that person is of value. but because i'm no longer loved and cared for, i'm going. ‚úåÔ∏è	0

me [26 m] with my housemate and friend [23 f] of 3 months, she made some jokes at my expense that hurt my feelings, when i told her, she got incredibly angry at me, and started arguing about other things in the house unrelated to this issue, and went to her room, has not spoken to me in three days. hello /r/relationships, so this one might seem a little silly but i've been ruminating on it for the past few days and i could use some objective outsider advice on how best to manage it. **background;** my housemate, let's call her laura, moved in to my house in early january. we instantly hit it off and started spending a lot of time together after work. we would lie in each others beds and cuddle, watch fashion runway shows and critique all the models, drink wine and talk about our ex's, our past traumas and our hopes and dreams, watch trashy reality tv and generally support each other. she is a little younger than me but we are at similar stages in life, both of us are working close to our home and it's been really nice to have her around, just great fun, with in-jokes a plenty and i even told her about my anxiety disorder and the antidepressants i take, and she told me about her assault. our third housemate brendan [30 m], moved over from romania to work in the same field as me here. he was moving to ireland for his wife, who has now left him so he is understandably in a bad mood. but he is a very difficult person to be around. i have tried to be supportive and help him out but i go to work every day and put up with the shitty health care system and then come home and have to listen to him complain about it all over again. me and laura bonded a lot over our shared burden of carrying poor brendan. we'd take shifts and everything. he also never once ever cleaned the kitchen, left his takeaway boxes on the table, smoked all my cigarettes, ate my food and never took the bins out. i like my house to be clean. i hate clutter, i don't like bad smells, it's a really nice house and since i've been living here longer than the other two i feel it's my responsibility to keep the place well. i also manage all the bills, i manage the rent, and i park on the street risking a ticket and fine, so the other's can use the driveway. **the issue** me and laura have a very jokey relationship in the way we talk to one another. for example, when we moved in she put a big sticker saying fat on my weighing scales, and so i threw her eyeliner out the window. we're a bit like a brother and sister, sort of always mocking each other playfully. making small little jokes at each other's expense- well usually her making jokes at my expense but this has worked quite well and i have enjoyed it and laughed a lot. but last thursday, laura had had a bad day at work over something and was in a bad mood at home. i was giving her cuddles and asking her about it and she was telling me and that was all fine and then we went about our plans of going to the shop to get treats and home to watch americas next top model. she was making jokes at my expense as usual, but they were harsher and more frequent than normal. when i bought my bar of chocolate she counted out the calories on the back saying i needed to seriously use portion control or how would i ever find a man. then in the car on the way back she said that if i had sex with someone i would be conscious of "all of [my] bits jiggling during sex". i'm 1.73m tall and weigh in at 70kg, so i am not overweight, but i am trying to lose some weight and i go to the gym a lot for conditioning (and cardio for the anxiety of course). i'm not really fat but there are different standards for gay men, and i want to be attractive to other guys so i do want to lose some weight, and laura knows this. the last comment that really hurt me was when later watching the models, someone said "if you could get plastic surgery on one thing on your body what would you get" and i thought about it and said "i don't think there's anything i would want to change". then laura chimed in saying "i can think of 7 things off the top of my head that you need to get plastic surgery on" and started laughing. i know it was meant as a joke and not serious but that one hurt my feelings. i finished out the episode and went to bed. i felt like a doormat or a punching bag all day the next day. i kept ruminating over how i was the only one in the house who cleaned the place, how i as the only person doing basic communal things like bins and stocking fridge, and for laura to say that to me showed me that like, fuck my feelings? like i can just be your punching bag to get out your stressful day at work? i have never once nor will i ever comment on her body like that. does she think it's ok to say that to me because i am a man? **the communication** all of these thoughts were bubbling away so i decided to talk to her about it the following day and it didn't go as planned. i said to her "hey, i know me and you joke around a lot and i usually really enjoy it but yesterday you went too far with the plastic surgery comment and it hurt my feelings". and she basically got extremely defensive straight away and started arguing with me saying "how am i meant to know what will offend you and what won't? how is it fair that one day you'll be fine but the next i have to watch what i say incase i offend you? it was clearly meant as a joke" and i said "i know it was a joke, and you didn't mean it, i just wanted to get it off my chest that it was a hurtful joke, and its not ok for you to take out your work frustrations on me. i'm not your gay pet." then, she changed the subject entirely and without warning and was actually shouting at me at this point saying "and i know you went into my room and took the cups out and washed them. you do not have permission to go in there." i had taken cups out of her room to use the dishwasher because if i didn't then no one was ever gonna but i also can recognise and respect that there was a boundary there that i didn't think was a boundary and i had crossed it by entering her room alone. so i apologised immediately for that and said that i hadn't known. she stormed off to her bedroom and didn't look or talk to me for the rest of the night. **the silent treatment** now to make matters even more complicated, that very evening i happened to have a gentleman caller over to the house and me and laura's bedrooms are adjacent and share a wall which we affectionately named the berlin wall, and we would always be talking to each other through it as it is quite thin. i had sex with my man friend on my bed at around 11pm (she had work in the morning, i did not), and the bed was extremely creaky and i was really conscious of how loud we were being. i eventually actually cut the sex short because of the noise knowing she had work next day. i text her saying sorry about noise but got no response. we haven't spoken since. she came home from work friday and went straight to her room to pack for going home to her family home up the country for the weekend. i called up the stairs asking did she want anything from the shop but she just said "no, i'm leaving for home now". it's been radio silence ever since. i'm driving myself mad thinking what i have done wrong and how i could have approached the situation better. i want to show that i am assertive and won't have those comments made about me, but i don't want to push laura away because i love spending time with her. right now i'm just giving her space. i'm thinking (hoping?) that when i confronted her, she felt guilty and thats why she reacted like that, as guilt is an unpleasant emotion, so she went on the attack without thinking. i'm hoping that after the cooldown period at home she will talk to me again and things can go back to normal. she will be home tonight but i am on call working till 8pm. i feel really nervous to see her like i don't know where on earth this is headed and its stressing me out loads üòîüòîüòî do you guys have any advice on how to navigate this successfully? i would really appreciate your insight or to tell me where i've gone wrong, or if i should reach out and apologise again, or just leave it and let her come to me in her own time... **tl;dr!** housemate told me i needed to get plastic surgery in 7 different places to look pretty (as a joke). when i confronted her about it she got angry at me, and then i had loud sex up against the berlin wall. hasn't spoken to me in three days.	0

hey i'm looking for some dating advice ( i'm an 18 year old guy interested in girls) tl;dr i like a girl but recently got out of a relationship a few months ago and don't if i'm ready for a new relationship or if it would be fair on the new girl. so that's a quick summary. so to start my story i have to go back 1 year. i started noticing this girl around quite regularly, i thought she was very pretty but never felt like i had a good reason to talk to her. that was until i realised she was a swimmer. this was perfect! i was a swimmer for the national under 18s men team but i was still a bit hesitant. so 1 month past and my friend and i were getting some food and my friend new i liked this girl, she walks into the line to get some food and my friend urges me to talk to her, so i do. i introduce myself and we had a good chat, i even made her laugh a few times. i didn't tell her about the swimming yet because i thought she might think i was up my own arse ( sorry ). that night she added me on snapchat and sent me a message and we continued talking until she fell asleep. i went to bed that night so happy because i hadn't felt that way in a long time. so a week passed and no messages but all hope wasn't lost because she kept smiling at me and when we talked it wasn't awkward and we always had good conversation. so fast forward another month we are talking everyday and every night and i couldn't be happier. however now it got kinda awkward because i found out my friend was also messaging her in the same way i was. so we spoke about and decided that eventually she will decide who she likes more, and she did, it was me. so she stopped speaking to my friend without me knowing. so the day comes, we both feel super comfortable around each other and she keeps talking about "us" as an item. so i ask her out and she says yes. as you can imagine i was over the moon. to celebrate i took her to a nice dinner. i paid for the whole thing and we both has a great time. we went swimming together and both got really competitive and of course i had to let her win a few times. in my eyes she was the perfect girl. loved sport. not to focused on how she looked but enjoyed makeup and clothes but not obsessive. always liked to improve herself and was extremely motivated. i loved that she match me perfectly and made me want to push myself even more. she was such a strong women and i respected the hell out of her. a few months into our relationship and a problem started to arise, she got very ill, (this part will be quite graphic skip forward to the next paragraph if you don't like that kinda stuff) she kept being sick and lots of the time it contained blood. her periods were heavy and sometimes she even got 2 a month, sometimes she just fainted for no reason and it panicked me so much, she kept insisting that the only thing she didn't like was the double period. i encouraged her to go the doctor and she did. they had to run tests on her for months to try and find what was wrong. she kept getting new medications to try and treat whatever it was but doctors couldn't pin it down. with all the medications she suffered with lack of sleep, irritability, mood swings, loss of appetite, headaches and even more vomiting. i was get more and more worried. i suggested. a cancer screening and she agreed, she went and got a negative result and we were both relieved. but she still couldn't eat much at all. she lost weight and looked pale. then a revelation happened, the doctors found out she had celiac disease. for those who don't know that means you can't digest gluten. so she goes gluten free and finally her health recovers and we were both so happy. 3 months later after everything was all good it was my birthday. now unfortunately we couldn't be together for a few weeks either side of my birthday or on my birthday due to exam season. and she get extremely upset about this, i understood this as i would have been upset about it if the boot was on the other foot. i assumed she had something planned and was upset because it hasn't worked out. but i ended up nailing my exams and exam season was over and finally i get to spend all summer with my best friend. so we go to the beach on our first day of summer and then go back to our friends house for a few drinks and some food and it was a great day. later that month she starts to act distant from me and within 2 days she suddenly hated my guts. i had no idea what had happened, i was panicking, she was screaming and shouting and crying. she didn't see me for weeks after that. she didn't message me but i messaged her because i wanted to know she was okay. at this point i knew she was seriously upset about something. 2 days after messaging her and no response she blocked me on every form of communication, i only messaged her on snapchat and called her phone a few times. i haven't seen her since this happened. i got terribly depressed and didn't eat for 14 days. i lost my place on the swimming team and still to this day have not fully recovered. i went a bit insane. my friends stood by me and one of my friends helped especially. we went out to clubs for every single one of those 14 days bringing fuelled by substances i won't disclose here and ending up in places that were dangerous, spending a ridiculous amount of money, having sex with girls we didn't know and haven't seen since and we don't know anything about them but we assume we aren't dads since we haven't got a phone call or letter in the mail. i ended up in hospital, underweight, dehydrated, and depressed and suicidal. i had betrayed everything i ever stood for. and for what. now i'm at university and i'm having a great time. i love my course and studies. i've made so many friends and live in a house with 3 other people and am going to live in a house with 11 people next school year. and obviously there are girls at uni and i'm interested in a girl my friends live with and i'm living with her next year, but i don't think i should go for it because i still miss my last girlfriend quite a bit and i still think about her sometimes. that wouldn't be fair on her and she may not even be into

i [26/f] can't stand that my boyfriend [29/m] is so unemotional, and it's draining me, but i feel powerless to leave tl;dr: my boyfriend isn't very expressive, creative, or self-reflective, and it bothers me because after experiencing chronic dissociation as a teenager i've put a lot of effort into being more in touch with my emotions and being a more creative and expressive person. i'm afraid i'm being pretentious, a hypocrite, and simultaneously that i'm trapping us both by repeating a harmful submissive behavioral pattern that i learned from previous toxic relationships where i don't communicate that i'm upset or the gravity of how upset i am just to keep the peace. we also work together and that complicates things. i know intellectually that my decisions about the relationship are nobody's business but me and his. the real reason i'm making this post is that emotionally, i need permission from society to break up with him or stay with him. that's why this is a wall of text. that's the real problem. i was emotionally detached in high school and college, because i was so socially anxious to the point that i couldn't function. i'm still an introvert, and not perfect or even great at expressing myself, but i'm leagues ahead of where i was. now i like socializing and getting to know people because it challenges me and keeps my brain active. i don't ever want to go back to when i would mentally and emotionally shut down around everyone, and only existed as an empty shell of a person with no original thoughts or ideas of their own. i've spent a lot of effort getting better at being more observant, asking myself "how do i actually feel about this? why do i feel this way? how can i articulate that?" it's been very effective at stopping me from completely retreating into my own head. i have a lot of creative hobbies that help me get my feelings out. however, i'm still spineless and can't confront people or upset them. if i feel hurt by someone, i find ways to justify their behavior while criticizing my own. or i'll suppress negative thoughts and feelings entirely just so i can get through interacting with them. it became an automatic defense mechanism from an emotionally/psychologically abusive friendship that included very frequent gaslighting, constant, harsh criticisms, rewriting situations of me asserting myself as me being "rude" (encouraged by my mother), and the insistence that every time i was acting inappropriately everyone would notice and everyone would judge me for it. the second toxic friendship was someone who was possibly a literal narcissist. she was charming and entertaining enough to get away with manipulating and humiliating people, especially those that she felt had wronged her. i coped with them both by dissociating (what i call going on "autopilot"). in both cases i felt trapped because they insisted on interacting with me, and i couldn't possibly argue back or defend myself with my fractured mental state. i stayed quiet instead of fighting a battle i couldn't win. i kept up a relationship with them long after i should have cut them off. they both eventually stopped contacting me on their own, so i never actually learned to assert myself. my boyfriend is nothing like these people. even though he doesn't abuse me, i'm worried that i'm trapping us both in another relationship where i have a valid reason to want to leave, but i shame myself into staying because of the fear of everyone judging me. we've been dating for nearly 4 years and are each other's first serious relationship. we work for the same employer. it's not even a secret; everyone at work noticed and now it's common knowledge in the company that we're dating. he's a smart person, great at his job, and a very sweet and doting boyfriend. all i have to do is say that i'm cold and he will snuggle me or hand me his jacket. i'll mention something that i like off-handedly and he'll suggest doing it or bring it to me within the week. he's my work gossip buddy and workout buddy. we can speak about things at work and about our field in a way that we can't with our friends. he's the first person i text when i'm feeling strong emotions and i just need to tell someone. he says he has social anxiety and also dissociates sometimes in large groups or new social situations. he has the same problem that i have: because of his anxiety, he has trouble being observant and expressing himself. when we first started dating, i noticed that i felt differently about him outside of work. if i didn't see him at work, i would ask him about his day, and he would only say, "it was fine. nothing interesting happened. how about you?" :) sometimes he would give a list of things he did, like he cleaned his house, he played video games, he watched netflix, he read an article about today's political scandal and he'll briefly describe how crazy that was, in monotone, but he wouldn't have any stories to tell me about himself or how he felt about anything he personally observed, and that would end that conversation. if i asked more questions, he would give maybe a sentence or two in response that wasn't conducive to further conversation. i told him about myself, including what i want to do with my life and those terrible friends i had. i excitedly talked about what i thought about what we were doing at work and groaned about our bosses. he listened intently, was never judgmental, gave constructive criticism, laughed at all my jokes, and supported me unconditionally. i didn't notice at the time that although he had interests, he didn't really have much to say about them. he liked cooking (still does!) and talked about cooking, but he wasn't really excited about cooking. he talked about his past and his family when directly asked, but he never expressed or talked about how anything affected him. he never said anything that i could validate for him. he didn't tell me his feelings or insecurities he had so that i could support him. i did almost all the talking; i was compulsively talking, about anything, to fill the silence. most of our dates were him cooking for us/going out to dinner, then going back to his place (he hated my shitty apartment) and watching something, then sleeping together. he wouldn't let me do anything for him in bed, and he was dead silent for two years, even when i asked him to make noise, because it made him "uncomfortable," and he said he only wanted to please me. he expressed about the emotional range of a small magnet. he was usually either "pleasantly content :)" or "sulking :(" he tended to only text me first to discuss plans or ask what i was up to. conversations were centered around me, or shared common interests, but never about him. if we wanted things that conflicted with each other, he would almost always defer to me. i thought all this was really romantic at the time, until i noticed he'd never let me do him any favors. he's often sick and every time i offered to bring him something, he said no thank you. i had to throw a tantrum once when i wanted to do the dishes for him after he cooked dinner for us both. what i knew drove me completely fucking bonkers about the relationship at the time was that he became whiny and excessively complained when he was minorly physically uncomfortable. like if he was a little bit sweaty, hungry, tired, etc. with no way to fix it he would go into a corner and sulk. even if we were out with friends. if he couldn't go into a corner he would cling to me and sulk. he very often resorted to default responses, like canned stock phrases that cost him no mental effort and don't encourage further dialogue. like "yeah, that sounds fun. glad you had a good time./that sucks that happened. hope it gets better./ i'm sorry. hope it gets easier./at least this happened or didn't happen./should be a good time./(when we're about to eat) "let's chow down."/great. can't wait." :) he used to be really bad about this, especially in situations where what i wanted was empathy. he also dropped these cheesy, cringe-inducing "romantic" lines. it used to be that if we weren't at work, he would only start talking to tell me something romantic, or to initiate cuddling, or sex. he would say something like "i love cuddling with you so much." his favorite thing to do was to grab my ass or boobs, then say "sorry, i couldn't resist/sorry, i couldn't help myself." :) he called me "baby" once, and i told him that i liked it, because at the time it was something different. i regret ever saying that because now it's become one of his default words. "what's up, baby?" how you doing, baby?" "you ready for bed, baby?" other than enjoying cooking and being great at it, he doesn't have any creative hobbies. outside of work, he does regular chores at his apartment, smokes weed, grows weed, watches tv shows, browses reddit, and plays video games. he is constantly, consistently on reddit, but he only lurks and never comments. which is objectively not bad, but it bothers me to an irrational level. i tried to foster an emotional connection with him by watching things together, playing our favorite games, or listening to music together, and i would continuously get frustrated when afterwards he only offered simple opinions delivered flatly like "it was neat." "it was a solid album." "the fight choreography was cool." he then told me that he really doesn't feel anything from movies, games, or tv shows. he passively consumed what i consider to be beautifully written, thought-provoking, and inspiring media like its mindless entertainment, and even though i know that's objectively not bad, it baffles me. when i was dissociated, stories and music were the only ways left i could feel anything. writing about them on message boards was the only way i could really talk to anyone. at the same time, whenever i was pissed off at him, i held back how pissed off i actually was because of my "autopilot" defense mechanism. when we were at home, he had to be constantly touching me, groping me, grabbing my ass or boobs, or "cuddling" that was actually squeezing, to the point where i felt like i had no personal space. we would be watching a movie, and he would be holding a boob. not squeezing it, not paying any attention to it otherwise, just holding it. my friends called it the "i'm excited to have a girlfriend" grope. i would politely ask him to stop groping or squeezing me, he would stop, pout and say "awwww," ‚òπÔ∏è sometime later he would mindlessly do it again, i told him to stop, then he would joke about it "sorry, i couldn't resist." :) and we repeated the process. i didn't scream at him that i asked him to fucking stop like five times already. he is also mostly responsible for the only panic attack i ever had. i trusted him to give me an amount of edible that i, a non-weed user, should be able to handle. he didn't think about that and he gave me the same amount he gives himself, a very heavy weed user. then after i calmed down a bit from the attack but was still very, very high, he tried to initiate sex. i said no, and he listened, but i was fucking fuming that he thought that was a good time. i noticed that i was feeling numb and would go into "autopilot" at times on dates, and i knew that only happened when i was suppressing negative emotions. i had so many emotions, and ideas that i wanted to express to him, and i wanted to do things for him, too. he never talked about his past, so there seems to be nothing from it that meant anything to him. when i asked him to tell me a story from his past, he put up a lot of resistance and said his childhood was "boring." he would talk about work, things on reddit, food that he was making, video games, and politics only when prompted. it seemed like the only fulfillment he got in life was pampering me and getting to touch me, because that was almost everything he really wanted to say. my idea of minimum acceptable verbal/emotional communication may be off. nearly all of my friends and family are talkative people. when i talk with my friends, we play off each other and can go on for hours. all of my friends love stories and music as much as i do and think about them as much as i do. all of my friends have rich interior lives and some kind of creative outlet, or a bunch of random hobbies that they make sound interesting. i learn new things about them whenever i talk to them. they are for the most part emotionally aware of themselves. they are skilled enough at observing and commenting on every day occurrences that they make normal life interesting and fun. i can feel how passionate they are when they speak. i barely sense any emotion from him. my friends think that he's a little bit robotic and delicate but he's still a great guy (they're not wrong). one friend in particular keeps saying that he's great for me and not wanting to talk about feelings is "just how guys are." but, it seems like all my other male friends, some of whom are married, are able to do this? "you can't get everything that you want in a relationship. the most important thing is that he cares about you!" i thought he was slow to open up and not everyone had to be like my friends. i could gently encourage him and eventually he would open up and tell me more about himself. "hey, do you think you could stop using your stock phrases like 'it was neat,' and 'great. can't wait.' and try to put more creative thought into your texts? also stop the romantic lines. i want to hear what you really think and the lines sound insincere. please stop literally squeezing me and holding my boobs whenever we watch things. it's weird and your hands are sweaty. maybe you could try actually saying something on reddit instead of just lurking. could you come up with opinions about the things we watch and describe your day instead of saying 'nothing happened'? something happened to you today, i don't care how stupid or inconsequential you think it is, i want to hear what you thought about it. i'm going to start doing more things for you and i want you to let me, because i don't like being unequal." i thought i was trying to improve communication and that these were small adjustments to make. i really didn't think i was trying to change him as a person. i was tired of feeling like a spoiled princess, my personal space being constantly taken advantage of, and my range of emotions being squashed by his own limited one. i hoped he only needed time and eventually he would let me into his inner world and actually be the secretly deep and introspective person i thought he was. these talks eventually became, "i'm not happy because i don't communicate in the moment when i'm upset with you, and you don't want to communicate at all." he said that he agreed and he wanted to get better at expressing himself, while i would try not to hold things back until i exploded. when i first brought up the excessive whining and pampering he responded with annoyance, defensiveness, and a lack of self-awareness. when i first brought up the whining after years of tolerating it, even though i didn't get angry, he yelled at me that he just wasn't that strong a person, and it ended with him storming out and slamming the door. he still refused to believe for awhile that he was that bad. when i tried to bring the problem up in the moment he demonstrated it, he overreacted. i didn't even yell, i said simply in response to his complaint "you could be a little less whiny about it." that was all it took. he got flustered, then stormed off. i could tell he was angry, because when people walk very quickly ahead of you that you have to run to keep up, and their feet are slamming the ground, and they're not responding to your requests to slow down, that means they're angry, doesn't it? but when i asked if he was mad at me, he sighed and said no. then he insisted that his complaining wasn't a big deal and he was going to ask my friends if they thought he complained too much. i dared him to do it, because they have seen his captiousness for themselves and i have an entire reddit post to show him as the last straw. he never did ask. when i told him that i don't want to be pampered, he got defensive. then he said "if you want to do something, you should just ask!" as if he forgot every previous time i asked and he said no thank you or insisted that he do it. he gets prissy whenever he's stressed out. for example, the other day he needed to put his cat into a travel cage to go in the car, which of course the cat hates and resists every time. i pissed it off immediately prior to this by picking it up over and over and finally sticking it behind a closed door because it wouldn't stop eating the christmas tree. my boyfriend groaned and said "well great thanks for making it harder for me." and no, i didn't argue back that maybe i should've let the stupid cat eat the tree (?!). we have made things better. he stopped groping and squeezing and i feel like i have enough personal space now. i do the dishes when he's done cooking. instead of excessively complaining when he's physically uncomfortable, he recognizes that he's about to get into this mood and sees himself out. he's dropped a lot of the stock phrases and most of the cheesy lines. he puts more effort into starting a conversation with me and talking to my friends. he's still great to work with and talk to about a variety of topics. he can have a lot of eloquent responses when talking about something like our field. he's great at polite small talk and schmoozing at company events. he can give me a great pep talk or advice when i'm upset. but still, getting him to talk honestly about himself, or get an emotional response from him is like running into a brick wall. it still feels like when i ask him a personal question, he doesn't really have an answer, so he says what he thinks sounds romantic or what i want to hear. if we are cuddling, and i ask him what he's thinking, the answer will be that he's horny. recently when we went to see a concert, afterwards he asked me if i had fun, and i said i had a great time, i was shocked that they played my favorite song because i thought it was too obscure compared to their other popular songs. i asked if he had a good time, and he said "of course, the best part was being there with you." :) when i asked him recently what his dreams are, he said it's to get a master's degree (he doesn't know in what) and for us to live together. then when i asked him, "what are you looking for in the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?" he just described me. after i questioned that further he admitted he hadn't really ever thought about it before i asked. i have had to push him every step of the way to be more open and examine his own feelings. i have to hold his hand through basic introspection skills. i don't like that it feels like my job to evaluate the relationship and point out problems. and i don't like feeling that every time i do it he gets stressed that his comfort bubble is popped. i feel like i'm holding myself back all the time, because i'm disappointed every time i ask him what he's thinking and he gives a generalized or trite answer, or doesn't carry on a conversation. he's improved so much and he's trying but its not enough. i can write pages and pages of text and he can barely write enough for twitter. i don't like the dynamic we have outside of work. there, he can't pamper me or touch me. he can't turn his brain off. if i ask him what he's thinking, he has to give me a real answer, instead of responding with something cheesy or sexual. we are complete equals and are each other's perfect audience to bounce ideas off of. at work, i admire him and want him. at home, i'm frustrated and confused. it feels like to me, if i didn't put in all this effort, even if he doesn't use obvious cheesy lines, our relationship outside of work would be quiet, romantic, cuddly/sexy time, with no depth or introspection. i don't expect my partner to write the next great american novel but is it too much to want him to have realistic thoughts about himself and our relationship? to have a larger emotional range? am i being pretentious? am i wrong to want a boyfriend that expresses himself, challenges himself to leave his comfort bubble, has a creative outlet, won't get flustered when i ask them too personal a question, that has actually taken the time to examine himself and what he wants and can articulate it and will check in with the relationship regularly? i wanted a boyfriend i could share emotions with, i didn't expect to have to drag them out. he's not a bad person at all, which is why i feel so guilty. i understand why he is the way he is. being anxious in response to stress, the obliviousness, the lack of creativity and emotional range, saying things you think people want to hear because you don't actually have an answer, i used to do all of that. am i a hypocrite or selfish if i'm upset about him having the same problems i used to have? if it does come to me leaving, i don't know how to do it. i still love him. i'm afraid i will regret it the second i do it. what if we could have fixed it? are either of us too broken to be in a relationship? intentionally making someone upset goes against my programming so hard it feels unnatural. breaking his heart feels like kicking a puppy. if i break us up, it will make everyone upset. including our coworkers. absolutely all of them will notice and everyone will judge me. i will go back on autopilot, convince us both that i'm making a big deal about nothing, and then scream at myself later. i didn't know i was this bad. i didn't think i would do this. i fucked up and i don't know if i can fix it.	0

please help me make tomorrow a better dayüòî i'm a 17 year old high school student. mistreated, lied to, cheat on by a girl i would've done anything for. she made all these promises but could not keep them. i was never good enough for her. we dated for 7 months, it was fun and healthy at the beginning. but then she started seeing other people when we're together, sending nudes to others. yet, i still love her so much. i never had the courage to break up with her because i was way too attached. i made her my only source of happiness, i cut off people for her. girls she said made her insecure, i cut them off, just for her. its been 2 months of me being like this, crying right after school, waking up at night punching my pillow out of anger, and not being able to breathe because i miss her so much. the past two months were so toxic. i knew she was taking to other guys, i knew she was cheating on me. but yet, i allowed my love for her to blind me. i had more respect for her than i have for myself. i just want to get over her, i want to stop stalking her instagram and snapchat. i know it's better for me to block her on everything but i can't even force myself to. i called her literally 15 minutes ago, to see how she's doing. she answered and said she's talking to another guy and hung up. it's 2 am and i feel devastated, balling my eyes out as i'm writing this. wishing she's by my side. i want tomorrow to be a productive day, work on my assignment, focus on school. but i know i won't be able to do it. i'm too weak for this, she was literally my life. i seriously need help. please, anyone, i need advice on how to get over someone that i love so much. i want to forget. even though i'm going through so much right now. i want you all to have a good day. if any of you want to talk about anything in particular, reach out to me. it makes me feel better trying to help other people because i know the pain. take it easy guys üòî‚ù§Ô∏è‚úäüèº tl;dr i just really need help to get my shit together. i feel so down because of a breakup. i can't focus on anything. i got cheated on multiple times. just please reply something positive honestly, even just a word or two. i'd appreciate anything. thank you guys	0

it's not you it's me. my ex. 10 years. my ex use to yell at me if i didn't know what i wanted to order as soon as we got in the drive thru. my boyfriend tells the drive thru cashier to will be a few minutes." and tells me to take my time. there rush. my ex would get drunk and yell at me for 4 hours telling me how horrible i was, that i was i psycho. that no wonder he dies what he does my boyfriend tells me how beautiful i am for 4 hours when i feel defeated by a world that has no use for my kind heart. my ex would have me doubt my own thoughts, my own sixth sense, people that i should of listen too- for years telling me it was in my head. constantly hide his phone,be on his phone for hours. in the middle of the night. where he always had access to my phone. my boyfriend never gives me any "thoughts" other than how a real relationship should be. how honest he is. how there's no secrets regarding phones my ex and i weren't friends on social media, every photo was to be "vetted" prior - i wasn't aloud to post pictures( esp of us together)- only ones he approved. or i would be seen as desperate and attention seeking or i didn't look "hot" enough. my boyfriend has us as his picture, he posts of our adventures and things that we both do. always quoting how happy and how lovely i am. he tags me in dog memes and sends shit he know i would love. no hiding. my ex would tell me that i wasn't good enough at my job and no one likes me, just so i lost my confidence to do things. my boyfriend help and guides me through things if needed and he will walk to work with me, when i get home ,he will ask how my day was and listen to me rant or be frustrated and then kiss my head and cuddle me up. my ex never helped me bring the shopping in.. i was terrified to tell him how much i spent on what he needed or what he requested - losing his shit and making me go back out if i had accidentally forgotten something. my boyfriend runs to open the door for me and won't let me carry anything, even my purse. and if i forget something he will go and get it or say it doesn't matter. my ex when i was sick and stuck in hospital with nothing but my clothes i had on- away from family and little friends i had, left me there. didn't call or check or drive the two hours to bring me anything. instead just fell out with me for a week because i hadn't txt him for a hour hour as my phone never had battery. as soon as i say i have a headache or feel i'll my boyfriend gets me water, tells me to rest. will ask how i feel and even when i'm hungover sick he will bring me breakfast in bed and leave me sleep haha! my ex would start a argument or a fight amoung my friends and i , have me make up excuses and lies so i couldn't go out with my friends - i lost a lot of friends because of this . my boyfriend comes out with me and my friends and wants to know them. my ex told me that my family bullied me, that they took me for advantage and we're trying to get in my head. he met them once in 10 years... i would have to avoid family gatherings etc my boyfriend said he loved my family, took time to spend time with everyone of them, he wanted to meet my entire family. never complaining once. my ex said that he scraped the bottom of the barrel when he found me, why would anyone want me. he would comment on my face, my hair, my clothes, my figure- tell me to train more. tell me i was to dye my hair blonder. my boyfriend tells me he loves me the way i am and gets frustrated when i have no confidence- tells me i'm his gorgeous girlfriend. my ex threw a breakfast sandwich at me that i made him at 5am before work because it didn't have cheese on it. my boyfriend is appreciative that i get up at 5am to make him breakfast- or anything that i do for him. tells me how good i am too him. my ex's birthday and christmas's, he would give me a list of things he wanted, he would expect everything on the list and if he didn't he would sulk and say that i obviously don't care for him. or complain that he didn't get want he wanted and fall out with me for days ...( this was a regular thing) when in return - in 10 years he only ever bought me two christmas presents - both i bought/ordered for myself. and only ever received one birthday card- coz he wasn't about the "fuss" my boyfriend tells me how i'm so generous and loves everything i have ever got him - never complaining once. even when it's something shitüòÇ our first christmas - he bought me gifts- of things that i had mentioned during our relationship. never have i ever been spoilt so much by any human. (not that i'm materialistic- but the thought is there. i would understand if there was a financial issue- but i have been in debt in the past because of this person) turns out in 10 years, he has a girl friend of 4 years and a wife and two children. he would lie and tell me that he was with his kids when he was on holiday with the other girl. he told her the same when he was with and he told his wife that he was away with work. there was a number of girls over the years... that seemed to appear after i finally ended it. making me feel small , pathetic and worthless! never has someone made me feel so humiliated in my life to a point i would question whether my life was with living- if i really was that horrible person and no one would ever want me. that i was never gonna be good enough for anyone. then.....he appeared like some kinda tall tanned adonis ..my boyfriend. made me realise what is right, how a relationship should be. basically saved me. - but he doesn't know this. my ex is an unattractive self centred, lying,controlling, cheating, selfish, narcissist. my boyfriend is a caring loving and attentive soul. trustworthy and honest.who would do anything for me, and is literally the hottest guy i've ever seen. as cheesey as it sounds i didn't think these people still existed and i am constantly scared that it's a dream and it will all go wrong. hence why it's 0346am and i'm awake on here. never settle for an unhealthy love. you are worth it. i am proof that you can move on. i had to share my own experiences because i know a lot of people can relate. ‚ù§Ô∏è	0

had my first creepy male encounter in my neighborhood and i feel dumb i was walking home from the gym at night in shorts and some guy came up to me and asked if i had a man. i should have said yes but am not a good liar so said no üôÑ he asked for my number and i basically said no thanks, he asked if he could walk me home and again i should have said no but i'm so shy i have a lot of trouble telling people no. so he walked me home, only took a few minutes but was v awkward. i told him i'm gonna go inside now but thanks for walking me home. he touched my butt which has actually never happened with a stranger before and i went inside quickly. now i'm thinking about the whole thing feeling so stupid for not telling him i'm not interested and now he knows where i live. why am i like this...	0
a close friend is considering suicide and i'd love some advicedepression can often make people feel like absolutely nothing works, and this is what's happening to my friend. it's scary, she's very scared, she doesn't know what to do anymore. yesterday she texted me while in crisis and it was heartbreaking. she told me how she thinks of herself as an unloved person, as a failure, and how she really cannot see any future and was considering ending her life. i understand that she needs therapy, but she doesn't have access to it, and therapy won't be enough either. she needs support from people close to her too, but i have no idea what to do. i can't just tell her that "everything is going to be okay", i really can't. i'm going through the exact same thing as this girl and it's heartbreaking that i don't have a different perspective on life, but i truly see her as an amazing person, and she really deserves to live, only not the hellish rollercoaster-like life she's been living up to this point. are there any recommended hotlines she could call or text for free? could you let me know about something that comforted you during a moment of crisis? thank you very much for readingüíö	1
tweezing damn near all of both my eyebrows off obligatory this happened a little over 3 weeks ago. i was getting ready for an event that i really wanted to make a good impression at, and i got a little too tweezer happy and was so zoomed in on my eyebrows that when i stepped back to look at them, they were gone! except for like one skinny line, 1-2 hairs thick üò≥ (without eyebrows) i don't wear a lot of makeup, and don't usually draw on eyebrows, so every day since has been a pain in the ass, having to draw them on just fucking right so my face doesn't look weird. and not just a little weird. i have never appreciated my eyebrows more. they've almost grown back but not enough for me to not have to paint them on every mf day. tl;dr 2 weeks ago getting ready for an event accidentally tweezed almost all my eyebrows off. now i have to draw them on everyday and it takes forever	0

tired of trying for a dumpster üî•i have had two suicide attempts in the past. i failed both times because i caved and told my fiance those were a little more spontaneous. i have a plan this time. i'm not really writing for help. i'm more or so just writing to get this feeling out of me. i have a plan for new years. it makes sense and it will make sense to the people i love. i have written letters to everyone important to me and one with my last wishes and sealed them all in envelopes. new years last year i was violently raped, so it figures i wouldn't react well to this new years. that isn't the main reason i'm doing this though. i feel i just keep trying and failing at everything. i have worked four temporary jobs in the last year and not one of them hired me on, but none of them had a negative thing to say about my work. my fiance resents me because my sex drive is shitty and my sex drive is shitty because one i have zero self confidence and two because i resent him for not working and being a video game addict but i can't tell him that because he's sensitive and it will crush what little self confidence he has. i also have tried to loose weight and i can't it's fucking impossible. i eat 650 calories a day, mainly veggies, fruits and nuts. i only drink water and milk. i run two miles everyday. i lost 20 pounds and it's been 3 months and i haven't lost a single pound since. i'm behind on rent, phone, electric, and water. i'm about to loose my health insurance again which means i'll loose access to my therapist and my bipolar medication. so the feelings i'm having right now will only intensify. i'm just really really fucking tired of trying so hard to keep my shit together and pay my bills, and keep my fiance happy, and pretend to be happy for my friends and family, and go to jobs and improve companies i'm not getting hired at or paid well at. i'm tired of trying to loose weight, be healthy, work, pay bills, socialize, love, feel, talk, fucking all of it. i just try so hard all the fucking time and never get a god damn break not one in the last six fucking years. honestly the world is a giant hellfire anyways our president is an idiot, our government is corrupt, our media is sickening, people are generally bad, the earth is dying and no one cares. so yea i just don't wanna try and honestly i don't wanna be apart of this fucking dumpster fire anymore. alright that's it. thanks for coming to my fucked up ted talk.	1
i 23f have been dating 33m for about a month. thoughts? tl;dr new relationship is moving fast so, we met on tinder and talked for a few days and hit it off on our first date. he is very recently divorced . married for about a year but he was with his ex for 6. she cheated with a married man, he tried to work through things but she had no remorse and is still seeing the married guy. all of this should make me very cautious. he would not seem to be proper dating material. i let him know very early on that i don't like dating around and that my intentions are to find someone to settle down and start my family with. he was receptive to that and had expressed wanting more kids in the future. at the same time he has said that everything is fresh and he's "winging it" with me. well that phrase also ought to make me nervous. the thing is though, he's treated me better than anyone i've dated. we are both enfp. he does all the thoughtful sort of things that i tend to do for my significant others, but that no one really does for me. little things like keeping my favorite drinks in the fridge, or a big thing was when he came and leveled out/ fixed up my horse stall before the rain. he is so, so sweet. i've been around his family. he brought me to eat with his friends once (without telling me, i was in sweats üôÑ). it seems like its moving fast and well for "winging it". i'm pretty intense and extroverted and he's the first extrovert i've dated. we've been making time to see eachother almost everyday. i'm slightly insecure because he will be spending time with his ex for the sake of their kids on christmas. like i have to wonder, what if the ex decides one day she wants him back? i mean i am setting myself up for that possibility. just wanted to have somewhere to put my thoughts i guess üôÉ	0
i've been craving a mcdonalds filet-o-fish sandwich for a few weeks... i've been craving a mcdonalds filet-o-fish sandwich for a few weeks... today i finally went. i had to run and pick up a prescription for a family member and on the way, i saw a mcdonald's. i immediately think, "hey, i can get that filet-o-fish i've been craving!". so i go through the drive through and decide i'd get two. i only eat mcdonald's about once a year, so i thought i'd just indulge a little. 2 filet-i-fish and a small coke! i got my order and headed over to the pharmacy. it was this really small mom and pop place. just the counter and a few seats to sit. the pharmacist said it would be about 10 minutes so i took a seat. my stomach did a weird rumble. it cramped. my butt felt like it was about to explode. no problem. nobody else is here so i lean over a little bit and let one out. not bad, not smelly. ok. not ok. it got worse. i look around, no bathroom, everyone is out of sight doing pharmacy stuff. i panic. i remember that there was a walgreen's a block away (they aren't my family member's regular pharmacy). i walk over, butt cheeks clenched, and ask one of the workers where there restroom is. "i'm sorry, we don't have a public restroom." wat. "but there *is* a safeway a few blocks away", she tells me. i felt my butthole spasm as if it was going to explode. head for the door. there is a grimy thrift store just half a block away so i walk carefully over and ask the nearest person where there restroom is. she lets me know and tells me the code to get in. i get in. i open the stall. toilet is stuffed with toilet paper and crap. there's no way i can use it. there's another stall, and i open the door. it's good. üëç i barely made it. tl;dr: filet-o-fish made me blast a crap.	0

going to therapy tomorrow to figure out how to cleanly separate with my (30f) partner(39m) because the holidays retrigged the traumatic start to our relationship and i cant attach to his daughter. i want to believe he'll be a good husband but i can't trust him. my boyfriend's daughter recently moved away with her mom a few months ago. her visiting for the holidays pretty much retrigged the trauma of the beginnings of our relationship (will explain in a sec). i have as kindly as i could told him i can't see myself ever completely accepting her as my own, i don't know how to not feel like i'm sacrificing a normal family, and i've tried so hard to make that happen but we're broken. we're going to counseling tomorrow to try to figure out how to end this the best way we can for us. i am considering also showing him this thread if it's not too painful. the backstory which paints why i can't see her as my daughter which is largely due to how he originally made me not trust him as a father or husband: we hooked up a year and a half ago. i didn't eat and drank too fast because i was speaking publicly by mistake got black out drunk which i never let happen to myself. i was ashamed. we hooked up, he didn't use a condom (we are both responsible). from that point i was put off by him and didn't really want to see him because in my head that told me a lot about him and myself for that matter. we still talked, i love talking to him, and he's always been incredibly kind and giving so i thought i'd give it a second shot because hey we all make mistakes. a month or two later we see each other again, and im really depressed because i hadnt felt true love in a long time. i go out dancing a lot, and we live on the west coast in a major tech city where a lot of what would be normal people are into psychedelics. i've been here a few years so i'm used to it. he ends up doing too much k, and he's nervous and embarrassed but i'm not super phased by it because i kind of just wanted to hook up and i go to his house. but again, didn't take it seriously because i didnt respect someone with a kid going out and doing drugs irresponsibly with someone he still didn't know all that well. i fucking get there and wanted to leave. his place was a mess, an absolute mess. and then i realized his daughter lives there every other week. in my mind i was so turned off by this guy, i couldn't believe he almost 40 and living like his, partying, bringing random girls home to this place, and also having unprotected sex?? but the day after something happened to my eye, he took all day off to take care of me. i felt.. adored? it was such a huge dilemma for me. so i figured maybe i've been painting him all wrong, he obviously seems like he's fallen for me hard. but then i kept asking him to get tested, and it took him like 4 months and he used every excuse. during that time we broke it off like twice. i was appalled. he has a kid what kind of father acts like that, i told myself a lot. my respect for him and as a father tanked. the intros to the daughter happened... far too soon. within two weeks. she's been so used to girls coming and going it didn't phase her. also he didn't tell me he was still married and going through a messy divorce and potentially being a full-time dad until 2 months into the relationship after he said he loved me, huge slap in my faceshe's incredibly sweet and bright. he does treat her well, is very present with her and adores her but there are things i don't agree with. first of all, he still lives like an "artist", meaning sometimes hes still waiting for checks in the mail.we went on vacation together early on and as we're in a car he asks me if i can spot him because checks haven't cleared. i would never have a child under those circumstances and if i did i would choose their future financial well being over my "dream". even now, i have to sacrifice what i want to do for my career for what's feasible for a condition that i have that requires a lot of treatment. the girl is also 11, and she doesnt partake in chores in the house. i have issues with his hygiene, and then realized she's not made to take a shower every day? that's fine if it's someone else's kid, but fuck not my own? i used to get so angry because he's wipe cum on his sheets and then i'd realize like 2 months later were still in the same sheets and his daughter is climbing into bed with us. he still barely cleans. we agreed that i'd help him find a maid but she rarely comes and i'm always telling him i hate staying at his place. i'm repulsed. he's tried to get better but fuck, the idea of living in this chaos and having to train two people? one who is not mine who i don't feel like i love? and i've tried to be active in her life so much but i can't say i love her like my own. i like her like any other kid and have about as much patience but i'll never see myself being as excited as my own child. i just can't love her. and maybe because i also see her as an extension of all these bad things about him that hes instilled in her, that i never had a chance to be a part of to try to guide. in our relationship, my ptsd was triggered from a rough childhood. i've put myself in iop and it's helped, but i guess the constant anxiety of really needing his love but hating everything about the environment i was in just destroyed. i take responsibility in letting it get there, and i'm trying to work throgh my flaws which did not give me the confidence to know i'll be ok without him. but he did show up. after his daughter moved away, he was there for me. he was also before but you know how it is, he has obligations and i understood, but i am human and still wished we could have been just us. but he learned how i worked, helped with anything to set a routine to help me do my ptsd exercises and also take care of my other condition. he was very patient. at one point we broke up a few months ago and i started seeing someone else, a fling, and got back together. he's also been very accepting and patient with that as well. but i also think it's a crutch. but it really kills me because hes the only person in my life that always wants to be there for me even when it gets bad and we're on the rocks. i cant tell if that's his seperation issues and mine, but that's where he's better than me, where he can put things aside and still want to mend. so then i've been in a rough cycle. i hate the state of what our relationship is and it just never seems like it'll work. but we're also best friends. i hate him for some aspects of the way he is, but i know he doesn't mean harm... he's just lazy and makes a lot of excuses. i'm ok with that in a friend but not a husband. he keeps saying he wants to grow with me and have a family with me, buut i never see how it would be possible. i feel like i'm wasting my time. i feel like he ruined it with how he was in the beginning. he's changed a lot but it's so marred. the holidays are here and he has custody of her then. the day she comes back, i hadn't seen him in almost a week, she's around and yelling and it's making me anxious during a time i'm really trying to destress. everything's a mess, she says "daddy today i was supposd to shower! it's my shower day" and i'm grossed out because he didn't prioritize that . he wasn't going to brush his teeth before bed until i said something. again. and then she's like daddy can i sleep with you guys? and he looks at me. i mean i'm sorry i can't see her as my own, i'm grossed out, and now i have this pressure to tell her no?.. he says i could have said no, i could have, but it's putting so much pressure on me where i already feel so prssured. and i couldn't take it, i excused mysf and said i felt sick and left. i keep hoping one day i can get over it and feel like a family. i feel like an evil step mother because i can't see myself loving her. he's not making it easy. i thought, maybe if he had a nice home, was organized, was more responsible with his life and career... maybe i could take in someone else's kid. even then i don't know, but i tried so hard. made her such elaborate cakes for her birthday, send her texts when she's gone, even drove up with them to drop her off at her mom's when she moved. but i can't reciprocate love like her stepfather has with her. but i love the good times i had with her father so much. he doesn't want to let it go. he always tried coming back to me when we broke it off. i found that weird, that i could say i don't know if i could love your child, and he's still try to be with me. but it's hard. he's gone to therapy, although the too late, but has improved a lot. we've been through a lot of shit and now we're toxic best friends. it's so hard because i don't feel like i can count on anyone like i have with him. sure he pisses me off, but no one in this world had put in so much effort to try to make this work. i guess the trauma for the beginning might not ever let me move on. like i said we're going to therapy tomorrow to try to make a clean break for everyone. i still want my best friend. or maybe i'm clinging and can't move on. maybe someone out there can share some insight, tell me im being evil for not loving a child or show some compassion, or maybe miraculously tell me how i can save this with some magic elixir. or how do you make a clean break in therapy ? tldr: i have been trying to break it off with my boyfriend because i resent his irresponsible behavior i endured for months which has made it impossible to see myself being a stepmom to his daughter and him a good husband. but he's my best friend. thanks guys happy holidays üòû	0

i (31f) don't know if i should "loan" money to my irresponsible (22f) friend backstory first. we're coworkers (i'm actually one of her bosses) but pretty close friends as well. we hang out, we go out to breakfast, send each other goofy messages, she's watched my kids, we share juicy gossip, and she gropes my ass and boobs from time to time üòÇ. i could do without the last part, but i don't want to hurt her feelings and tell her i'm not attracted to her in that way. anywho, a couple months ago she and another coworker tried to get me fired. she claims she was cornered into making a statement against me, so she did. i'm not going to reveal details because this isn't a throwaway and i still have nightmares over it. i could have lost my job, my livelihood, the source of income for me and my rather large family. i was devastated and felt so betrayed. i got written up to the worst severity, but my job is still intact at this point in time. and guess what?? i forgave her and the other coworker. i really don't/can't hold grudges. it isn't in my blood to be that kind of toxic person, but obviously now i'm apprehensive of our friendship and kinda distrustful. fast forward to this week, a mere four weeks after the investigation at work was closed. my friend has the audacity to ask for help with a speeding ticket fine somewhere in the ballpark of $150. she dropped major hints and then finally outright asked me last night. coming from the woman who pays for her drinks at the bar, her lunches at work, sometimes her nails and makeup she knows this is petty cash to me. but should i be giving petty cash to a petty person? ohhh and i gave her $100 just because i could tell she was struggling like 2 months ago. i mean i love her and feel bad for her, but this feels wrong. plus, she was fucking speeding like over 30 mph over the speed limit. soooooo. idk what should i do? tl;dr my friend tried or at least aided in almost getting me fired. now she wants money for a speeding ticket and i don't know how to say no.	0

alright. last post. hopefully.saw a scheduled message i had set like two or three years ago while checking my messages to make sure i was leaving everything okay. it's an article that read "23 things seniors should do before they leave high school". it was a message i was going to send myself for when i was a senior. the message was scheduled for january 1st 2022, at 12 am. i actually thought i would live to be a senior at one point. how cute. ‚ù§Ô∏è sorry for the spammy-like posting. just thought that was kinda funny (even though i know it's more sad than funny, but sarcasm!). wanted to share, since ya know. last words and all. probably.	1

i [22f] don't get along with his [23m] friends tl;dr the title of this post. how do i deal? can i? long backstory ahead: my boyfriend, oliver, and i have been seeing each other for a little under a year at this point. we met in college and we have so much fun together basically living together (3 days at my place, 3 at his every week), traveling, eating out and just generally enjoying each other's company. standard relationship fare. we have one major problem which is his friends. i don't get along with some of them. one of them recently just stirred up drama yesterday. we'll call her penelope. oliver is friends with penelope because they went to high school together. i don't think they actually have a lot in common. they hang out very infrequently (twice last year despite not living very far from each other) and when i've asked him why they're friends, all he said was "she's nice and was a cool girl in high school." it doesn't help that they hooked up early on in college as this makes me definitely feel a little territorial around her even though she's engaged. the first time (and so far only time in person) i met her this past december, i admit that i came in on a high horse. she didn't ask me anything about me, so i got a little butthurt and asked her why she was getting married so young. i'm blunt and very to the point, but again, i admit that this had a judgmental jab in it. later, before new years, i tried to extend an olive branch. i had oliver text her letting her know that if she needed ceremony music, i'd be happy to help (i've been playing classical violin my whole life and have done wedding gigs since i was 10). she texted back politely declining and added that she had felt attacked when we had met. he did his best to keep the peace (offering a quasi apology on my behalf while also defending me "sorry you felt attacked, she didn't mean it in a negative way really; she's just blunt"). fast forward to valentine's day, oliver took a zumba class with me. we had actually had a fight over this as he originally didn't want to take the class with me because he felt emasculated and i was hurt by that. we discussed it a lot before he agreed with my pov. i filmed a bit of him dancing in class because i was proud and posted it to my story on instagram. she responded with "i'm dying üòÇ". i replied back sharing a bit of my struggle with him because i'm trying to bond with her, and that's what i would've shared with my own friends about my life/relationship. she then became patronizing telling me that i shouldn't be offended that he didn't want to dance because it's just not who he is. i replied explaining that i was more upset because he actually admitted that he was feeling emasculated which for me, is basically sexist and how it does make me wonder if we're compatible in the long run. then she made this long comment about how coming off strong never changes anyone's mind with some more patronizing advice. i was furious now and let her know that how she said what she did was not only patronizing, but also evident that she didn't read what i had written: he and i had calmly discussed the zumba issue! she apologized, i accepted and we wished each other a happy valentine's day. yesterday, 3 weeks after the ig conversation, she texts oliver out of nowhere asking if he knew of our ig conversation. he was with me the whole time it was happening and read my messages to her before i even sent them. oliver told her "yes, i saw" and she asked why he wasn't upset that i had insulted him. again, he did a good job at keeping the peace (i wasn't insulted because her being harsh means she cares, but thanks for having my back, penelope). she goes "ok. i just wanted to give you a heads up because she was ranting and what did she want me to do, agree with her? i figured i would warn you but i guess if you know and you're okay with it... as long as she doesn't flat out try to change you and force her opinions on you." he assured her i don't/won't. i found the whole thing incredibly disrespectful. to both oliver, as in not trusting that he can make his own decisions, and our relationship as a whole. i get that she's maybe coming from an angle of concerned friend, but i don't feel like it's her place at all. i feel like this would be really weird if she were single. she also could've just been like "hey! just checking that you're happy in your relationship" rather than claiming that i had insulted him because i didn't and trying to subtly insinuate that i'm a controlling bitch. i get really mad thinking about the whole thing because i want to confront her and let her know how i feel about this whole thing. i think oliver handled it really well between them, but i want to make all these ridiculous boundaries like "you can't hang out with her 1 on 1." besides therapy, how else do i get over wanting to make oliver choose between me and penelope? how do i process feeling like she's trying to undermine me and my relationship? i think i feel really torn because a part of me feels obligated to be her friend as he claims she's a big part of his life, ie. if oliver and i were to get married, he would invite her to the wedding. i get that a part of me feeling threatened is probably because i don't feel the most secure in my relationship, and another part is because i feel like it says oliver and i don't have compatible values if he's friends with people i don't get along with. it's really tearing me apart right now and by extension, my relationship with oliver. i will gladly take reminders to sit down and be humble, and even more gladly take vindication comments that she overstepped. regardless, i'm sure there's plenty of context that i'm leaving out that i'd be happy to supply in comments or in a pm. thanks for taking the time to delve into my petty personal drama today. repost because i forgot the semi colon in the tl;dr	0

is she (f23) just playing really hard to get with me (m27)? there is this pretty girl that i met off tinder years ago once. we both wanted a fuck buddy thing but that never happened. she likes all my instagram posts and sometimes responds to pictures she finds attractive being flirty as i do the same with her. she has wanted to hang out a couple months ago but i was busy and she was busy when i'd message her to hang out. i also have been an ass and ghosted her plans when she asked twice if she wanted to chill a long time ago. why still talk to me? does she really like me? i messaged her one evening asking her to come over ;) and she said: "tempting... but i only fuck people i know well and vibe with! and i don't know you well üòïi'm sure you'll be able to find someone tonight though üòâ have so much fun üòò" to which i replied "i did thank you ;) have fun cutie" and she responded "aaayyy! haha perfect! ü§ôüòÇ thanks babe" the next day she posted an instagram story wishing a guy happy birthday and she called him ciroc papi. i think he's been on her story once before a while ago and i know they're not serious. is this platonic? it might be? **tl;dr**: **does she seem somewhat interested? should i let go of her? would you let go of her? is she just playing hard to get? she was sweet but also didn't care i was sleeping with other women**	0

i have nobodyi have literally nobody in my life that currently gives two shits about me, but i know the second i would kill myself, everyone would be all "omg we loved you so much omg why did you do this to us ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫" my mom, who has always been very openly disappointed in me and the fact that i am not the daughter she always dreamed of having, now has the dream daughter she always dreamed of now that my younger sister is 16, loves makeup and clothes and girly things, and is flawlessly beautiful and good at everything with a boyfriend and dozens of friends. exactly what my mom wanted from me but never got because i'm ugly, have no friends, have never been in a relationship with anyone, etc. you'd think i would be the one upset over that, but i accepted it and she's the one who's always complained about me "dressing ugly" and not wearing makeup (when, again, i didn't care and none of my peers cared how i dressed or what i put on my face). due to her now having the daughter she always dreamed of and not having to settle for me, she has been increasingly treating me like absolute shit the past couple of months. like... for example, despite my sister being on her phone easily 5x more than i am, the other day my mom yelled at me and made up some bullshit lies about how, because i got frustrated that my phone gave out on me a couple days ago and deleted a bunch of shit, i'm addicted to my phone and essentially need mental help for that (whole time i'm thinking "what i actually need is help for my depression but you insist i'm lying about having depression, then have the gall to tell me i need to come to you with my problems"...) i told her to stop twisting shit and making up lies about me, and she has now been giving me the silent treatment for about three days. this includes her making dinner for everyone else in the family and purposefully not including me. that's fine. whatever. i've known for years how little value my life holds and she has done nothing but affirm that for the entirety of my adolescent years. what bothers me is that if i were to actually kill myself like i want to, this bitch would turn around and make it all about her and act like she's a victim. i know she would do this bc she did the same thing when her own mother died. they barely had a relationship, yet she made herself the focal point of that woman's death. it was disgusting. i am fully ready at this very moment to kms and would love nothing more than to do it tonight, but i don't want anyone, especially that bitch, to pretend to care.	1

first and last post under this usernameit's time for me to say goodbye. i don't recall the last time i had a modicum of desire to live or get help to live. i've seen multiple therapists, many who said i was too fudged up for them to see and referred me out. i've tried what feels like every antidepressant out there. i'm not close to my family, who publicly shamed me about my depression and suicidal tendencies. i've lashed out at and pushed away any and all friends. i have no romantic relationship. i live on my own. if i were to have some breaking news to share, i literally would have no one to call or text. i'm $350-400k+ in debt from student loans. i've failed to get into the one career i was relatively excited to get into x3. i don't have a job lined up and my contract with the current one ends soon. i don't know where i will live. the one last confidant i had told me we shouldn't talk anymore (understandable given how toxic i am) and proceeded to share everything with his girlfriend who i have never met and told me to call 911 (not understandable and imo, a breach of my trust in him). i've been dealing with crippling depression and have had to choose between that versus binging and purging a minimum of 10 times a day (thanks eating disorder). the first and most likely only way i'll be found will be due to the stench of my corpse. thankfully, the coronavirus lockdown is facilitating my death. i sincerely hope i don't wake up tomorrow. if in the most unfortunate event i do, i'll have a decision to make. i've been told to get help and to commit myself. the issue is that it requires me to actually give a crap and *want* to continue living and *want* to get better. i honestly, genuinely have no idea what that even feels like and don't care for it. i'm beyond saving because i didn't want or care to be saved. i've been guilt tripped into living, and fyi - never do that because for someone like me, continuing to live is excruciating enough without being guilt tripped or blackmailed. i have no desire to live or get better. i haven't for years. i've been a mindless meat suit with little to no integration into or contribution to society for the past 5+ years. i've already sent out packages and letters to people who were important to me but left. i know my death will hurt my immediate family but i literally have no one else in my life that would odd me or even know i'm gone. i'm selfish and i've been so detached from everyone that frankly, i don't care and when i'm dead, i definitely won't care. good luck and best of wishes to everyone on here. i've seen a lot of posts expressing a will to live and that is a wonderful desire to have. i truly hope that you can find and get the help you need by whatever means. you *are* important and you are your strongest advocate. please take care of yourselves. you do you. ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

after a month's research and deliberation, i finally bought all the furniture for my new apartment i moved into my new place a month back. being a stingy shopper i had planned to buy everything used or second hand from a local classifieds website. but it all turned out into a painful experience stretching over a month. number one: me, overthinking. number two: the sellers reply too slow. sometimes they won't reply at all. they may live far away from my place, and it's always a headache bargaining prices with them. in some cases i saw sellers put year-two years old item at the same price as new! why would i buy it from you if i can buy new in the same price? and then there comes tiny things you need in your apartment: cutlery, bathroom essentials and what not! for that i made multiple trips to various malls, hypermarkets, wholesale markets, whatever people suggested me. but everytime i would go, not only it would tire me out, but i would buy lots of random shit that was like 2 bucks or 5 bucks but not the real stuff which i actually needed, and which i actually went to buy. because they tend to have a higher price tag, and me being the stingy shopper, would not buy those but other random shit, which would eventually add up to a long bill. this constant overthinking over furnishing the apartment and at the same time saving a few bucks made me a maniac over the month. my apartment is all messed, filled with shopping bags of random shit. i was not eating or sleeping well. i had no time and motivation to clean up because i still didn't have the furniture. i figured that while i'm stressing about saving 50 bucks by looking at hand me down websites, on the dresser that i really needed, i had actually already spent that money on takeouts (because i was not cooking/doing grocery due to all this drama) and random shit as i already mentioned. so i just got so sick of it today, that i just turned on my laptop, went to ikea website and bought all the essential furniture items in my shopping cart that i've been deliberating over for a month. after that i went to a local amazon site, and just bought all the tiny/kitchen stuff that i absolutely needed. and added everything else to the wish list, until i really need it. i feel light. i know tomorrow i don't have to go to another interior store or hypermarket trying to find the best thing for my tiny apartment. all in all it costed me $500-600 to furnish the apartment, and depending on which economy you're a part of, you may say it was expensive or i made a good deal. but living in a city, where everything is usually expensive, i'd say i made a pretty good deal. also considering i'm all by myself as i just moved to a new city. it's worth mentioning here, that i'm an expat living in an expat hub city, where the rate of people moving out of the country is too high. even i'm not certain how long will i be staying here, may be just this year, may be the next year. so i did have a little buyer's remorse peeping out from the corner of my heart telling me tomorrow if i have to go back home, i might have to leave everything here the way it is, or may be go on to the other side of craigslist and be the seller selling my stuff at half the cost? but then i tell myself, no matter what happens in the longer run, at least i'm certain about the near future. and in the near future i see my self, comfortably and peacefully living and growing myself in my tiny apartment. üòä	0

did i (27f) deserve to be kicked out at 4am in another country by 28m with no money after breakup? i went to visit my bf of 2 years for one week in another country and was meant to move in with him may 1- flights pre-booked, 2 weeks notice given to my work and apartment, everything in place... the first day of my visit he worked in the morning, came back slept, and just watched a football game alone- nbd i'm not worried as i was a tired from traveling. the second day into my weeklong visit he just goes mute, he asks me to hang but says nothing, just one word answers if i ask a question to start a convo. comfortable silence is good with me but 4 hours when it's just us... üôÖüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we get home and i ask what's going on and he casually says, "yeah, this is never gonna work with us, you can stay at mine until you change your flight." but i have no money to change it and neither does he except for eur20 when flights are around eur100. so, whatever, it's over and i gotta deal. i won't fight for something when it's been so long since they've put in effort. so i leave around 8pm to hang out with a friend (and we eventually hooked up at there house outside of the city) then came back around 3am expecting the apartment to be empty as he said he would stay elsewhere... the doors were locked, my bag/ macbook/ passport are inside so i call my mom to see what to do- she says call the police. after he hears that he finally opens the door and immediately i notice he is druuuuunk, blackout, aggressive. he starts to call me a whore and was convinced i fucked someone else while i was out even though there is no way for him to know this. he says i cannot stay there- at 4 am he was kicking me out. nowhere in that country can you checkin at a hostel at this time. and then he says if i don't leave he will call the police to kick me out. in the end, after hours of him yelling at me, saying that after he leaves me and my mom dies (she has cancer) i will have no one in my life. eventually he decides i can stay on the condition that i sleep next to him on a twin bed, him holding me, and locked me is his room and hid the key until the next morning. i left the next morning and blocked him on everything... but was he right in kicking me out? am i an asshole? tl;dr bf broke up with me, said i could stay in his apartment for the night but decided to drunkenly kick me out at 4am with nowhere to stay / no money in a foreign country	0

thank you ‚ú® hellow ^u^ my first important exam this semester is on friday, and i already decided that i'm not gonna be here that day - yay no need to study! god i hate exams. well i mean, the 6 hours ones, where i just have to sit by myself facing a computer or a paper and a pencil are completely fine, but when i have to prove my knowledge and worth to other people for them to judge me? when i'm basically worthless? no thank you. luckily (or not so luckily for my mom, i love you mom) my mom take a lot of strong pills because of her condition, if i just get a little drunk and mix some of them together i should be okay from what i've read, and with okay i mean dead obviously. and if i die in a lot of pain, i probably deserved that too. well, i actually just wanted to say thank you to you all.. i've been here on multiple accounts, never made a post like this (simply because i'm a pusspuss and too scared of regretting) but i've talked to so many amazing people with similar thoughts as mine - people i've been so grateful knowing, even tho a lot of them were on their way to a better place when i met them - i hope we'll get to party together in a multiverse and be just be happy and free or something like that! - people who've really changed my thoughts about a lot of stuff. but yeah, this subreddit is a beautiful place.. harsh at the same time tho, but it has really given me a lot of insight. and talking to some of these people has really made me feel something.. for the first time in a long time. so thank you for that. to you who even care to wonder what went wrong in my life, lemme try and explain. long story short; i've always been this shy, unconfident alien, caring a lot about how people were seeing me. school has always been a very important part of my life.. it was the only thing i was kinda good at - i wanted to be the best, and i was for quite a long time. i did everything to perfection. i got straight a's and i was so motivated - god knows why. when i got into what we here see as high school (3 year period before university), everything changed. i was not like the other girls from my class. i felt like they were so much older than me, they were drinking, partying, just having the time of their lives, i was just me, reading books and my biggest worry was that people wouldn't like me. i tried to become just good enough... anorexia hit me hard, my brain wasn't what it used to and that ruined me. i started fainting in class, and at museums, at home etc. but i was doing fine, i was still getting good grades, i was still doing everything to perfection. in the end of 2nd year, my parents and teachers decided, that this wasn't healthy (i mean, looking back now, i was pretty damn destroyed but oh well), them telling me to take a break ruined everything, i was strong enough to keep going. i felt like the biggest failure, i was the biggest failure. still am, still feel it. i lost all motivation, i still this day wish i could go back and just.. me that me. i started taking classes again last winter, i've never felt so worthless and i find everything pointless. if everything went as planned i would be ready for uni next summer, heh i guess not. to study astrophysics to be exact tho. space has always been my thing, where i felt safe - darkness and with the stars and planets as my buddies. and oh lets not forget the black holes too! but lemme be real. i have a great life. i have the most amazing and supporting parents, i have the best brothers and that's the thing.. i've already peeked, my life can only go downhill from here and it will fuck me over. i will keep failing, i'll start losing people. i am just not a good person, and i take everything for granted. i feel so guilty and i don't deserve to be here. every other person would be more than grateful to be in my position, but i'm just not. i dream about more, i want multiverses, i wanna travel in space and time, i wanna touch the stars (okay not touch them, but you know what i mean.. i hope) well i don't know what else to say, don't even know if anyone reads this. but thank you if you do. and oh, one last thing. please please send me your favorite song(s), that would be so appreciated. i need to blast my ears with good music till the moment i die. thanks ‚ú®	1
bringing my phone into wc at work. throwaway account yadayada. no, this is not a "i dropped my expensive $150 phone into the toilet bowl." and my english is not good, so sorry about that. to start with, you need to know about my job. i'm an editor at a certain non-english news outlet, the only one left after everyone else just quit after about 10 months under a new chief editor, but they doesn't bother to find anyone new to fill the gap, so it's all on me. i write, edit, and publishing - meanwhile the chief editor daily routine at work is coming at 10am and going home at 12:30pm. this happened yesterday, at work. so, being the good employee i am, when i started hearing the call of nature at about 2pm, i take a glance at the list of article still need to be edited and approved. nothing, so i pick up my phone and step into the toilet. while sitting inside the private corner to take drop a shit and browsing reddit on my phone, a facebook chat message come up on my screen from the chief editor. at this hour, she is already home, or maybe somewhere else to take care of her personal business. while typing this, i'm blessed with the knowledge of hindsight‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, but back then i didn't. if i just ignored that facebook chat bubble, and reply it after i'm done, nothing would have happened and this post won't be made. but being the genuine good employee i am, in an industry that you need to rush your news out before everyone else for click, i tapped on it to check what it was. "where are you? why didn't you edit and publish the collaborator's news?" mind you, the collab's news wasn't there when i picked up my phone. at this time, i can't pretending like i haven't seen the message. so i need to answer. for some stupid reason, i think it wouldn't be approriate to just drop the whole shitty business into the chat, and i'm stupid too, so i put "i just got up and ran to the bank on the other side of the street," thinking it's just a small little thing that wouldn't harm anyone. this is the bank that my company use to make salary payment. but my response trigger something on a scale that i can never predicted: "why are you going to the bank in work hour? (duh, because bank only open at work hour i guess?)" "why didn't you tell me? (even if i really went to the bank, i still wouldn't tell her because she is at home)" "after this month, go quit the job!" welp, too bad. whatever. so after i'm done, i packed my bag and going home. i just finished letting my employer know i will quit at the end of the month. already worked as a part time writer for some other agency that pay nearly twice as much as current full time editor job, and already planned to quit at the end of the month, so it's no loss. but still, it could be a smoother quitting if i just honestly, blatantly going with "i'm in the toilet." the employer is a nice guy with multiple businesses, and i like him, but i don't think he can going far in this field with a chief editor like that.	0

wait wut? ok so this thing happened to me and it's kinda stupid so i thought you guys might want to hear it. alright so i was going through youtube you know as you do, and i saw this video named [the family friendly noose song](<url>) so it's a song about how to tie a noose pretty self explanatory anyway i thought it was funny as the world is just going to shit so i watched and sent it to a friend with this exact words " bro does yt want me to commit suicide this showed up in my recommended" and apparently he still has his phone monitored so his mommy called my mother saying that i was thinking of hanging myself and that i was desperate. a day before i was asking for username ideas for another app and he suggested hoeza134 and i said " honestly i'ma try if i get too desperate" do i guess they got it from that but they twisted it into me being highly suicidal and desperate to *end it* so they broke into my room fbi style took away my phone my tablet to monitor all my text and search history i had to argue for 30 minutes to get it back. after she called my siblings telling them i was suicidal and to talk to me. now their thinking of monitoring my phone and blocking everything that can be seen offensive. i won the argument after two hours and showing them my texts multiple times. she did not inform my siblings however so i had to explain it to them. so yeah that's it if you read this far then here have a cookie üç™. have a good day.	0

i'm giving uptrigger warning hi .. before i start talking about everything i want you to know that i'm not an open person at all. everything happens to me, i keep it inside of me, i don't share at all. because i believe that i'm a strong person and i don't need anyone and no one can help me .. and me posting and writing about me right now means i have reached my maximum desperation level. suicide is easier for me than talking about what's on my mind. but here i am talking .. i have attempted suicide on 1st april 2018 i hanged myself with the belt and i passed away for few minutes, the house was empty my brother got home and he managed to save me. before doing this attempt i was thinking all the time in every way that i could have a reason that i'm not seeing to be alive, even after attempting suicide i still think that i should do it again. to be honest my mom gonna travel in april again and the house gonna be empty and i'm preparing myself for committing suicide again and for the last time. the reason is i have nothing, no life no help no reason no job no college i can go to really nothing and if you wanna know why and how, it's simple. it's because i live in iraq. i been living in iraq since the day i was born and that is my curse i been trying to leave since the moment i started walking. iraq passport is before the last worst passport in the world. baghdad the capital is the worst city in the world to live in since 2016, i guess. there's no chance for me here, i tried and believe me when i say it i tried everything to leave to run away to work to find new ways but there's always a close road for me. i can't find another place to live in üòî i have no life here. no father. he left us since i was 9 years old. when i was 9 i was scared and sad because that happened so i started to listen to english music, basically eminem and i fell in love with him even tho i don't know what he was saying so i promised myself to learn the language and understand every song he makes. that's how i speak english now. also it is my curse to be honest because english made me what i am now. open minded guy who thinks and knows many things who knows how stupid and ignorant his community is who knows how everyone around is so dumb and not humans at all because no one here talk about emotions. no one care no one thinks about the other i learned a lot because of my english language and i believed when i was a kid me knowing the language and getting better at it will be my ticket out of here. so i kept focusing on it for years every day, every hour in every song. till the moment came and i found out that it's not even my ticket and i can't leave because i only speak english üíî i can't stand spending another year in this place at all. i can't be myself i can't even do my hobbies and find what i'm really good at because there's no right places for such things here. i'm giving up and i don't know it's the end of the line for me here i thought about sharing because i thought maybe nothing is changing because i keep everything inside of me. so here i am .. lost and don't know how to live like a human and at a least have a home. üíî	1
a poem/song about suicide. would like feedback, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî (still not finished i don't think) suicide on my mind it's just a matter of time, sick of telling myself everything will be fine, everyone telling me i can't take my own life but fuck it it's mine, ima take it as a sign that i shouldn't be alive, climb the highest building around and take a fucking dive, only faith i got is a leap, you would think my only life i'd be trying to keep, but the pain runs too deep, put the barrel to my head and i won't make a peep, just don't let my momma weep, i love you ma i'm sorry don't worry i'm in a better place, i'm in a better space, of mind cause i don't gotta think, my eyes don't gotta blink, just tryna sink, to the bottom, where i belong, if i'm dead then i can't go wrong, been wanting to release the pain for so long, but in my mind something telling me it's wrong, so i pro long my adventure with death, thinking about the day i'll take my last breath, i wonder how much time i got left, i'm just not tryna leave my family a mess, but i think it's for the best, when i'm gone my girl can go back to enjoying life, the only thing keeping me alive was thoughts of her as my wife, now that that's out of sight it just only feels right, i take a step closer into the light, confidence building up got me thinking fuck it i just might, god come get me i ain't putting up a fight, with hope nowhere in sight i'm tryna take a big bite, out of the apple of death, sick of the stress, you wouldn't know on the outside but inside i'm a mess, it feels like suicide might be best	1

a rant and maybe a vent.this is prolly gonna be long one just stay with me here please.. also sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammar i've been crying while writing this.. so ive been feeling really depressed and suicidal for way more than a month now but not sure how long. one of my friends asked me out, and we dated for a week until she broke up with me saying i can't be trusted and how i broke her when i tried my best to treat her right. this happened on halloween and when i finally got home after hanging out with my friends, i went to my room and cried myself to sleep. ive been feeling like killing myself or severely hurting myself since. no i dea why i keep thinking that but i don't find any positive reasons to live and all my friends and surprisingly my ex, none of them are want me to die but i think they're just lying and trying to keep me here so they can humiliate me and make me suffer even more than i already am with a busy and stressful life at school, and problems at home. i don't want to stay where i am, i just want to... go missing then to another country and if i still feel like killing myself i'd just do it where my friends won't know where i went. i know i sound selfish as hell for wanting to leave them here but i can't think of a better reason and i don't want them to see my dead body and having to deal with knowing i'm dead and they'd prolly be traumatized with seeing me so happy the last time i talked to them. i've been self harming really bad since i got dumped to the point all the cuts will leave awful scars. after i stopped for about 2 weeks since i broke the blade by accident, the cuts healed and i showed them what i did because i guess i tried showing them what happens after leaving me alone like that with my already alarming amount of suicidal thoughts. she doesn't like it that i say anything about the relationship but... i say it by accident and don't mean to harm her i'm just reflecting why i've been feeling way more suicidal after what happened. because of the problems at home i started cutting again but i broke the other blade aswell so i couldn't do anything. a week ago i was in pe when i got hit in the leg right to the cuts and couldn't continue playing. i went to the bathroom to check the cuts and it hurt so bad i almost started crying which resulted in my slightly bright colored pants to get a bit red from the blood. the teacher asked if everything was alright so i had to tell her what i did. after class she asked me if it was alright that she told the school counselor and i agreed because my friends blackmailed me into telling. ive been slowly getting a bit better by writing down why i feel depressed and now i'm writing it here, not the same words but the same meaning. ive been falling back down again and really bad.. i ordered a boxcutter online and now im waiting for it to arrive so if i feel like it i can just cut my throat open and die knowing i won't be a burden to everybody. anyways... thanks for reading this, i appreciate it that you precious individual took your time to read something as useless as this. i'm posting this in hopes of feeling a bit better have a great day though üíú	1
guy seems in love first meetup? i just wanna know if i'm overly analyzing this situation or not. yesterday afternoon, i was walking around, and this guy stopped me and said i was pretty. we talked and exchanged numbers and insta. he was just really touchy like wanting me to sit on his lap. when we were sitting down, he would repeatedly take my phone from my hand, to the point that i almost tackled him. he looked through my photosüò¨ and snooping on my phone. at that point, i had to just put my phone away. before i put it away, he saw i was on dating apps, and wanted me to delete it. i have some male friends, strictly male friends(nothing has or will ever happen inappropriately) not code or anything like that. and he wanted me to cut all the males out my life. this morning, he facetimed me and was asking to see me. he made me get out bed and wanted to see that i was getting ready. i told him it's too early, but he didn't seem to care. i'm not a morning person. he said to dress appropriately when i see him. not even 24 hours passed and he's saying what i can and can't wear? yesterday i was just wearing shorts and a tank top, and he said he didn't want anyone seeing my thighs. he's just coming off too intense for me. he has a incurable disease, who his ex gave him. i feel he's just trying to get with anyone he can. he said he's scared to trust me and that he really wants to be with me. does this sound like controlling behavior?	0

my teacher is looking out for me hardcore. so you know how in t.v shows or movies there's that teacher that looks out for one of the characters like they will bail them out of jail or like the will remove a shitty mark or something. i honestly thought that was an acting thing but this teacher is seriously something else. basically i'm doing my last project of the semester and i had the stomach flu for about a week and i'm pretty bad at this project, there was absolutely no way i was going to have this done in time and i probably would've failed the class. today, to my surprise, i sat down at my desk and my robot was completely different. it was finished. he smiled and told me "huh, looks like a miracle happened." this guy, who doesn't owe me anything and who i argue with all the time took the time to re assemble my whole project so i could pass. this isn't even the first time he's covered for me either. i was really late to my second period class and i told my teacher that i was doing something for my last period teacher (the teacher finished my robot) and she asked me to get a note from him confirming this and of course, he came through with the save. i don't know why but he's just taken me under his wing. he's a great dude. just really made my day amazing :) especially after getting an earful from my second period teacher telling me i'm not going anywhere üòÖ edit: should've mentioned this final project is worth %30 of my mark	0
sometimes it feels good to lose a friendship when i became friends with this person, i was very insecure in myself. i was scared of being judged and rejected, but ironically i became friends with a person who acted very standoffish and judgmental. we ended up becoming roommates and i was equally excited and insecure. we hung out initially, we'd go to parties and what not, but eventually we started going down our own path a bit more. over that year i decided to focus on myself. i worked on addressing my insecurities and just becoming more comfortable in my own skin. during this process i realized: i don't want a friendship where i can't be myself. i owned my hobbies and my always-changing weird taste in music and my friends and my style. i learned to be proud of the things that made me feel like me. now i wasn't blaring annoying music in our room, i just didn't feel the need to hide as soon as i sensed her judgment. long story short, her "hot and cold" attitude has just been cold for the past month or two. she's been rude and honestly just weird. we can't make small talk, like anytime i try it's just awkward as fuck and she gives me the cold shoulder. so i guess i lost a friend, i clarified with her to make sure i didn't do anything wrong or offend her and she said noü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. but losing a friend by being myself really shows me how much i've grown this past year. i used to be terrified of rejection and a people-pleaser. so i'm proud of myself for not playing other people's games and investing my energy into things that are better for me.	0

i have 6 days to change my life in a good way or i'm done. its been 22 years. 22 is a good even number to end things on. i made a beat called 22 when i was in highschool. anyway that doesn't matter. i'm a schizophrenic that doesn't experience much in terms of symptoms because i take my meds everyday. kinda sucks being so numb having my dopamine cut down so low. i have no motivation. i just wake up smoke cigarettes, go to the bathroom, eat, then go back to bed. sometimes i make beats somewhere in there. i've been making music for 10 years this year and although that should be a milestone it feels like a failure. there's people who've made music fo so much less time than me and they see success. i had a taste of small time success but then i fell off when i had a psychotic break and was admitted to the psych ward. i've been to the ward twice. second time was a lot more chill but it was for suicide watch. i was gonna kill myself last year in april but i did the "right" thing and told my mom and went to the hospital. i've gained 188 pounds since may 2016 from antipsychotics and it keeps going up any time i decide to have a second plate for dinner. this time i'm not backing down. come the 21st i'm really doing it. i have almost a full bottle of tylenol ultra strength that i'm going to take every pill in it. i want to go painlessly but wheres the fun in that? the acidic burn in my stomach, the bloody vomiting all over myself. sounds fun. i tried getting help. i really did. the psychiatrist just prescribes meds. i stopped telling her what actually goes on in my mind because she just glosses over it and offers to ads another pill for a solution. my mental health counselor is always busy with other people, and she's quitting and moving at the end of the month, so she's trading places with this idiot who stutters so much and has no idea what to do with his job. i k ow its not his fault he stutters but he's just so absent minded. i wouldn't trust him with any of my issues. and my support worker is cool, she's pretty and well she's pretty busy too. i'll see her for the last time on thursday next week and she'll wonder why my mom will be crying when she answers the phone to tell her that she can't pick me up to take me to hospital gym for this chronic disease management course. my friends want to help but they don't. they just gloss over the issues, say "i feel u bro. ur not alone" and then switch the subject. people say i have shit to live for but what kinda life is this? i'm stranded in a hick town. i was going to try and find a heroin plug but nobody knows where to get any. i figured going out in a warm fuzzy cloud would be nice but i guess a burning horrible scene and minutes of strong regret clinging to my last moments of life then finally peace. or i get to be a hungry ghost and suffer more. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i tried signing up for "betterhelp" and so i paid for a weeks worth of therapy and all of them either stop replying when i need someone to talk to or they said i'm too much to handle. oh well. lets play a game, convince me to stay on earth.	1

my friend told me "you're making this about yourself" is that wrong?a couple of days ago, i had a friend of mine who was being sexually harassed. so ofc i told a teacher at my school to keep him safe and now he is safe. one of my good friends got so angry at me for telling that teacher bc i shouldn't have said nothing because he didn't want to have nothing said. however, if i didn't say nothing and he got rapped i would never forgive myself. so i had told this friend that was mad at me that i have been feeling very depressed and i wanna die and i feel like i mess up everything even when i try to do the right thing. i asked if i can talk to to him privately and he said "well alongs if she is in the call then im not saying nothing ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" basically saying our other friends need to be there or he not saying a damn thing. naturally i was very very mad. to which i said "are you serious" and he said "very much üôÇ" he then said i was making this about myself. by that point i broke down. the fact the somebody i knew since the 2nd grade could care less, it was so upsetting and made me at that moment really wanna do it.	1

i feel so lost. (rant)i don't know what to do with my life at this point. i don't really feel joy in the things i used to enjoy. i do not have any plans or dreams or anything that makes me enjoy this shithole. i'm not really interested in living to be honest. it feels like an annoying chore more than anything and i hate putting up with it. i never had any close friends and now that i'm all ‚ú®grown up‚ú®i have no idea how to communicate with people. i have no idea how to live a normal fucking life. the thought of having to work 40+ hours a week just to survive is also really depressing and then getting old.. all the health problems - i do not want that. i feel so numb, so empty. i haven't felt suicidal in a while but it's coming back now. i'm not scared so i don't know what i'm waiting for.. maybe just maybe there's still a tiny bit of hope but for how long? :)	1

death of a sibling. i lost my sister last october she was 32, she had diabetes since she was 14, the last years of her life she was on dialysis and was blind. we lost our mom when i was 15 she was also 14. right now i'm 34. also my sister's birthday was in january she would've been 33, i feel so bad it feels so wrong and unfair that she died so young her life was cut short, like i'm supposed to grow old with her were sister'süò≠ life just feels weird nowadays, i try my hardest my best to move on to be happy i got a house in february which is great news, but i wish i could just call her talk to her again i talked to her the night before she passed, and right now my eyes are watery, i miss her voice i miss her. i'd be lying if i said i haven't felt suicidal, and thought about being with her and my mom. though i know she wouldn't want that for me she wouldn't want me to kill myself. no matter how bad i feel both physically and mentally i have to live for her. just when my time comes i hope i get to see her again and my other loved ones who have passed. and wherever she is i hope she's in peace no pain and can see again. take it day by day giving up isn't the way.	1
saying goodbye, one last time... i want to say, i'm sorry that i'm the real problem. i'll kill myself and it will be the only way i'll forgive myself and escape the pain. i just don't want to live anymore. i'm not important to anyone. my life is replaceable, anyway... my family is better off without me. my friends are better off without me. the world will be better off without me. you will be better off without me... i will do what the world wants me to do. i'll kill myself after school in 2 hours...hopefully everyone will be more happy with me gone... i hope i die... so, i just want to say goodbye... goodbye, everyone... üëãüòî	1

a little advice would be nice extra long, nsfw?, sensitive i [24m] have a peculiar relationship with a friend [22f] and i'll try my best to explain it. [tl;dr] made a new friend but met while she had a streak of infidelity but didn't bother me at the time. had a brief casual sexual relationship but she wanted to date and i said no because of the whole 'met you while you were cheating on your boyfriend at the time with another guy then moved onto me' thing but remained good friends. she got a boyfriend later on and they recently broke up and she came back into my life full swing and i think over time i've developed deep feelings towards her, then i told her. don't know where to go from here. in order to grasp the concept of this i'll have to rewind back to the summer of 2017 when we first met. i was at my apartment doing what any normal guy would do during a 100deg summer day in virginia, prepare for a day of fishing and drinking beer riverside. i shoot some texts around if anyone would like to come with and i get a slew of responses. 'yeah! what time?,' 'sorry got work, maybe next time dude,' 'whose number? new phone.' my friend mike says that he'll come if he can bring some girls he recently met and i say sure, sweet. (i'm single at this time btw). mike walks into the apartment with 3 girls, my roommate and best friend marcus are just noodling on our guitars in the main room while our other friends are playing tekken 7 to pass the time while we wait for everyone to get the apartment. this is the first time i met l, we all get up and introduce ourselves to the girls, exchange names, pleasantries, typical questions you ask people in college (i'm already graduated and she's in education program to be a teacher). after we've been chatting for awhile the next words she says to me are, 'op you know you're actually really hot right?'. i don't quite know how to respond so i just thank her and tell her it's the first time i've gotten that before and i tell her she's beautiful too. i find out she models part time and she shows me really professional headshots and others modelling designer clothes. **side note: i know i'm not an ugly person but i've never thought of myself as hot or super attractive. i'm just a guy who goes to work and plays videogames as a hobby, i typically keep to myself to the point that most people think i dislike them when i first meet them. **warning some explicit content and sensitive material coming up** ok so we go to the river and have a good time, nothing really happens. i catch a few fish downstream, then we all stand and float in the river to escape the heat and are drinking. we all say let's go back to the apartment and do some real partying (it's a saturday). we get back to the apartment put on some music, play some multiplayer games and have a great time with new faces. l gets a little promiscuous when drunk, she comes up to me again after we'd both had a good bit to drink and says 'you're so cute i can't get over it,' pulls me in and kisses me. i'm a little shocked. i look around the room for mike because she had been on him at the river and kissing him since we'd left. but he didn't seem bothered. he even joined in when a couple people went 'oooooo' and we all laughed. she kisses me and mike a few more times that night, i get a little uncomfortable that she's just going back and forth but oh well. wrap up the party and everyone goes home. call up mike the next morning and was like who the hell is that girl you brought over and are you guys serious? he confides in me that she actually has a boyfriend that isn't him and also they have a casual sexual relationship on the side. so she's cheating on the guy who calls her a girlfriend, with my friend, and is making out with other men like me. i'm kind of confused on the dynamic and decide to back off but it's not the last time we interact. fast forward two weeks and she broke up with her boyfriend and is still hanging around mike. until one of the last days of summer happens.. they get into a huge argument about one of mike's friends because he blew her off to go hang out with him and l doesn't like this friend because he's annoying. they get into a screaming match and she texts me asking if she can come over to my apartment to cool off and get away from him since she's actually staying over there with him for that weekend. i say sure, i'm just doing what i do normally and wanted to give her a judgement free zone. she comes in, i'm in the office portion playing bdo and she spins my chair around and starts really making out with me. putting her hand on my jeans, making extremely forward advances. i stop her and ask what the f is going on and she says mike was being an a-hole and she just wants me that she was dumb for staying with him for too long and that she always wanted to do this. she then continues. and i stop her again, and i ask what's going to happen? is mike going to walk in here and kick my a in a jealous rage? i'm not that good friends with mike at the time (we're fine now). i don't want to step on any toes and i want to make sure this girl isn't just finding some escape from her problems in men like i escape some of mine with videogames. so we have sex, despite my better judgement. mike walks in the front door, drunk (we usually keep out front door unlocked because we're friendly people and don't mind visitors). he's yelling and me and l are cuddling in bed. i walk out of my room, she's still in there getting dressed. 'mike it's 10pm at night and your drunk go to bed dude.' he starts pushing me around in my living room (which i am not okay with at all since it is my own home but i do nothing). mike is in a rage and keeps saying 'i wanna give that b a piece of my mind. she's a cheating slut and i'm not mad at you op i'm mad at her for being such a b. i know she's here, i just wanna talk to her.' i tell him that yes she is here but doesn't want to see you, just leave it alone, you and her made this choice. she comes out from my room and she's like mikey oh my god go home it's over. now mike is getting even louder and yelling and pushing me to get closer to l and i think he tries to swing. i tell him let's just talk about this calmly outside and sort this out. eventually i get a little fed up with his screaming and i say f this, i'm going inside i'll let you two sort it out. the moment i start walking away he choke slams l into the side of the brick building and i turn around and dislocate his shoulder and choke him out till he almost passes out and my roommate escorts mike back to his house while i tend to l in mine. **side note: i've practiced krav maga for about 10 years which is why i refused to fight him until i absolutely had to. hindsight 20/20, maybe if i did something sooner l wouldn't have gotten hurt. so we've been through a lot together, that night basically changed our lives. we carried on a purely physical relationship for a couple weeks until she asks about dating. i'm hesitant based on what happens, and i tell her i don't know if you'll actually be loyal to me. she says fine forget i asked and we kind of stop there. she finds a new boyfriend and they date all the way up until a month ago. we remain in contact, hanging out a few times, and to my surprise when we go out she's not kissing with other guys. any men that approach her, she'll be polite and flirt a little but if they get handsy or go for a kiss she redirects them to her friends who are single and ends the conversation with them. i start a new relationship with an ex i had awhile ago (completely awful idea) and we come to each other for advice when things get rough. i end up getting used by the ex so she could light a fire under the seat of her old ex to get some passion back, so i'm single again for awhile. then l calls me one night and says her boyfriend broke up with her cause his mother didn't approve and threatened him with a shun if he kept dating l. 2 weeks go by and she comes down for new years to celebrate downtown where i live and stays the night. the moment she comes in she gives me a huge hug and a kiss and says she missed doing that for a long time. we go out, she gets a drink from the bar and before she can even make it back to the booth a guy approaches her and they start hitting it off. cool, l is back to her old self. it's really nice to see. we end the night on a good note and i give her my bed and i sleep on the couch. in the middle of the night she pulls me into my bed and we cuddle (no sex). she leaves the next morning and says she had a great time, i did too. we talked about a lot of things and how we're so lucky to be each other's friends. we basically know almost everything about each other. she's back at school now which i still live near so we're in close proximity and we're slowly kicking off another sexual relationship but i think i want something more. after everything we've been through, after all the things we've shared with each other, acceptance we've offered and judgement free spaces we've given so that we can grow i think i may actually be ready to give her the best version of myself that she already knows so well. we got drunk last night together, nothing unusual, but i got emotional and i told her 'l, you know when i drop some truth bombs and you tell me 'oh op that's why i love you haha' and i say yeah i love you too? i think i might actually mean it' and i teared up a little bit in front of her cause i knew i felt it was right. and she's said i know. and i walked her home and told her i'd talk to her later. been thinking about it all day today, and needed to get it off my chest. sorry for the super long post! üôèüèª forgive me, and thank you all so much for any advice you give.	0
how to pay for college/scholarship suggestions/ideas? hey guys! so i'm headed into my undergrad this year and the thought of taking out loans is starting to stress me out. i've already taken out a federal loan, which is okay, but i'd rather not take out any other loans with higher interest rates. at the moment i'm looking at ~4500 left to cover for this year. do y'all have any idea how i could come up with this before i head to school? i know getting a job and such but i already have a lot going on this summer and i doubt anyone would hire me as l'll be away most the time. i'm signing up for private scholarships and i've already won one, but i guess i'm wondering if y'all have any specific suggestions, scholarship-wise? maybe some you have won in the past that you know are legit? i already know and use fastweb, scholarships.com, etc. basically i'm asking if you guys have any creative ideas as to how to come up with the $4500? thanks in advance guys! you're the best üëçüèº	0

listening to radiohead instead of train announcements this actually happened last december but i'm yet to make a bigger screw-up on public transport and that's saying a lot. so i live in england and last december, one of my hockey teams had a night out planned in blackpool, and i needed to go to preston to get some stuff done and on from there. it's a direct train so it should have been simple. i got my hair cut, had some food, and got to the train station in plenty of time. i checked the boards, and the train was on time. got to the platform and put my earphones in like usual. this wasn't a route i had done before, but what could go wrong? it's a direct train: so long as i watched the boards and listened out for the announcements if the board showed any changes, it would be fine. i would arrive in plenty of time to get picked up from the station and driven to join my teammates at the accommodation, from whence we would walk to revolution to start the night off. there were no changes to the train platform, and no delays displayed, and the right train appeared on the platform. i got on and it all seemed to be going fine. i didn't recognise the place names but yk, i hadn't done this route. about 15 minutes in, my dad called me to say find-a-friend was showing me going a different way than expected and insisted i check with someone. i sighed and asked a nearby lady if this was the train to blackpool north, and she said yes. all good. i got increasingly-suspicious though as i passed lancaster, which i could have sworn was the wrong direction. but i stuck it out for a bit and checked maps to see where i was headed. and that's when i realised i had verily fucked up. to cut a long story short, what had happened was i had technically got on the right train, but me with my earphones in hadn't heard the announcement to say the train is split into two carriages and that the carriage i was on wasn't the one going to blackpool north...it was the one going to the lakes. i ended up in carnforth and had to get back to preston and go on from there. on the flip side though, i ended up being really late to the accommodation and was just going to get a taxi to revolution, but it turned out my teammates had decided to wait for me. made my day. if anyone can work out how to attach a photo on mobile then lmk and i'll attach a map showing the routes but if not, a google search of 'blackpool to carnforth via preston' will show you what you need üòÖ **tl;dr: was supposed to go on a team night out in blackpool, ended up 40 miles away in pretty much the lake district**	0

got embarrassed at the gym. i'm usually not the one to get embarrassed easily, but i was at the gym doing some exercises on the cable machine and this guy came over and asked what body part i was working on. of course i was stumbling over my words and i told him i was working on my "backfat" and he showed me how to properly do it. he was being nice and i just felt so silly. i thanked him, i finished my set, didn't even do the exercise he showed me and hid in the bathroom for about 5 minutes. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i stayed for about an extra half hour after that and i did wave a sheepish goodbye to him but oh man, i just had to tell somebody. i think since i'm not feeling my best self right now i got a lil' too "emotional" about it. if i was in a better state i would've made fun of my form and would've been more lighthearted but..üò© tell me about your awkward gym stories	0
i gave up on life 5 years ago because i'm uglyi'm male, aged 30 (look younger) 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) skinny af lanky with long legs etc, pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin (never touched a girl or even had more than a few words spoken to me by one) so yea in the looks department it's over. i never leave the house and havnt since 2015. between 2012-2015 i had a bar job,i had girls like me and i wasn't ugly then facially. i got older and ugly. i met some amazing people but also some horrors. horrible women who'd call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers i worked with. the good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times by a fat ugly overweight bitch. ‚óæheres an example: i serve a table of 6 'ladies' in their 40s food and try being polite and helpfully nice as i can. not one of them says thanks and they practically snatch the cutlery and plates of food from my hands when i pass it to them. when they finished eating a good looking guy i work with went over to get the plates and they stacked the plates up for him we're all saying thanks and we're laughing and joking with him he was there for a few minutes. fucking hags.‚óæ in the end i got fed up and left and havnt left the house since to let ageing hit me like a train. üî≤(before i had that job i had the same job advisor for 6 months and she was the same, i was very quiet but also really polite and respectful and it got me nowhere, she was still snotty and bitchy with me and would totally ignore me if i asked her advice when i needed it. but yet you'd see other guys who were aggressive and disrespectful but because they were hunky/manly and attractive she'd open up easily to them and be very nice with them and help them no problem. this gave me trust issues) i do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and that's the same, women staring me down because i'm skinny like it's my fault they're fat. other guys i work with staring at me with a 'wtf is that' face and overweight short girls calling me a 'ming' (whatever that means) it's great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and i think 'it's nice when someone looks past what i look like'. it's funny how i succumbed to judging people's niceness to how they judge me on my looks or not. but there isn't many like that about. i eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner i feel better. still hidoeus nevertheless. a comment on here once i asked about my hair one comment said 'he's clearly balding and hidoeus btw' and it got upvoted 17 times. i drink whiskey every night watching cartoons and i'm starting to get chest pains. also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 at work and she was gorgeous too. you should of seen her instagram at the time it was fire. she worked in the bar with me. i was 24 then. i looked nice then. you should see me now it's depressing. waking up every morning crying through sleepy half shut eyes i basically live upstairs watching netflix everyday and smoking weed in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or younger/older have looks on their side and a life to go with it. funny how most of them are cocky as hell and very arrogant and the girls love it. i have a friend whos like that he's cocky as hell and thinks every girls he walks past fancies him and you wouldn't believe how the girls love that persona on him too. it's not about getting girls for me, but i could care less about not getting sex tbh etc it's juts the restricted life i have because i'm ugly and seeing good looking dudes treated better even when they're complete cocky arrogant assoles. lookism man edit: iv tried stopping the whiskey every night in a pathetic attempt to look less ugly again but i don't think it will work	1

almost cutting my dick off with an angle grinder before today i considered myself to use the best practices when utilizing power tools. i used to be a diesel technician and have done a decent amount of metal fabrication. i had a change of careers 5 years ago and became a paramedic. i have seen a couple gnarly accidents when people aren't safe. one would think i would be the last guy to have an accident. today my neighbor asked for me to cut a 3/4 inch steel bar for a tractor of his. i agreed and took the bar back to my shop where my angle grinder is. i locked it in the vise with confidence and slapped on newer cut off disc. as i cut downwards into the bar i realized that metal dust was fragmenting into my tool box. i decided to cut upwards into the bar to prevent this. if you're not familiar with using an angle grinder you wouldn't know that you never want to cut upwards into something like this. i did. i was being an idiot. i was 90% into my upwards cut of the steel rod when suddenly the weight of the bar caused it to pinch the cut off disc. this instantaneously launched the angle grinder back at me. without a second to realize it was happening the grinder chassis grabbed my shirt and swung with the force of an nfl kicker into my family jewels. this forced me to let go of the grinder and keel forward in pain. letting go of the grinder allowed it grab my t-shirt with the disc and pulled towards my groin. i grabbed grinder chassis but at this point it was pulling my shirt into it harder than i could fight. i felt humming through my arms as the motor on the grinder locked up. afraid to let go of the grinder i pulled it away from my abdomen stretching my shirt beyond limit. it felt like i was holding a pit bull by its jaws as it tried to maul me. i managed to quickly back up pulling the power cord out of the wall socket. the garage went silent. i had a vietnam style flash back to every final destination scene i have watched. i will never ever make an upwards cut into an unsupported anything ever again. i attached photos of my shirt and just how close i came to amputating my own dick. i was horrified and considering i use the angle grinder every single day i am now terrified with the fact i did something so stupid. for the record i wore my safety glasses. üòÇ tl;dr today i used an angle grinder improperly and almost caused potential penile amputation.

poison hemlock üåæüåø (read) hey guys, this is my first post ans i was wondering if someone ever heard of the poison hemlock(conium maculatum) wich is an highly poisonous plant due to coniine and other alkaloid toxins. it is very toxic for farm livestock and human( if you were wondering why did i post that in this subreddit hahaha). i'm 18 yo men from canada and i try to find this plant or another one that can bring me to death. i don't really talk about the reason but in nutshell my mind is very foggy and i don't think i have a purpose in life and school... quick fact, socrate use this plant for his death penality after his trial in athens.	1

i (30f) found out my boyfriend (29m) cousin's daughter is his actual daughter i (30f) found out my boyfriend (29m) cousin's daughter is his actual daughter my boyfriend of 2.5 years is very very close to his cousins, one girl in particular but it never bothered me. he loves his "daughter" very very much which i always thought was very sweet. recently he started calling her his "daughter", which i took as a term of endearment, calling her that was not that surprising since i knew how very close and loving they are with each other. but tonight i was in a bad mood and said "hey it's cute sometimes but not every time, she's not your daughter"! and he got so serious all of a sudden and told me that she is actually his daughter. i kept giving him many chances to say he's kidding because i could not believe it, but he just kept getting more serious as if he understands that i'm right to be hurt and saying stuff like "we can't change the past" or "i promise there is nothing left there" implying that he had romantic feelings at one point. or "it would be better if you continue to believe that she is not my daughter". so other than being disgusted that he'd knock up his cousin, (which is not the worst thing here cause his grandparents are first cousins and one of his uncles had a kid with his cousin, so it is not that entirely far fetched that this might happen) i am so hurt because he had been lying to me for soo long. and also i don't care if this is his cousin, the rule about past ex's or people we've slept with is that they must be completely removed from our lives, which i've stayed (painfully) true to. and not only do they talk every day but he is oddly (for me) close to this woman. so to sum up, he has this illegitimate 7 year old daughter born of incest of whom i've been believing is his cousin's daughter for 2 and a half years. and he is so extremely close with his cousin still even after they've slept together which is a big no no and hurts a great deal. am i crazy? is this pretty bad? am i within my right to ask him to restrict his contact with her, especially if it is not related to his child? i feel that there's just no trust left here and my instinct is to run away. has anyone experienced something like this before? is my response normal? i'm mostly looking to vent here and maybe get some understanding responses but if anyone has any advice please share. i want to run away. i still have like 2% hope that this might be some horribly cruel joke, of which i don't know if i can get over cause it took a lot for me to get to this point of believing that this is actually true. and he actually let me stay in the bathroom for 3 hours (and counting) without ever saying it was a joke üò¢	0
i wish i could end it without sufferingfrankly, i just want to be dead. life doesn't change whatever i do. the mental suffering doesn't stop. i don't like this world and how it is, and that will never change. i don't feel at place here. i can't be happy. every day is a torture for me. i wish i could die accidently or naturally. just go to sleep and never wake up again, or just get hit by a car and face instant death. can i for once get what i want, please ‚úã. there is no point in staying alive, as i will never be happy. i have reached my limit. i know this post won't change a thing, neither will the comments, but i just needed to vent this out somewhere	1

getting divorced but still dating? i've been married to my husband almost three years (25f and 26m). back in may, i cheated on him. it was wrong. ive started going to therapy etc. july 1 he filed. we have court next month to finalize. the whole ordeal was, rightfully so, devastating to him. we have one child together that we are co-parenting well. i've moved out. we have an uncontested divorce. the past week we've been seeing each other. he wants to start dating me again and "go with the flow" but is so adamant on getting this divorce. says he wants to see if i will fight for him and choose him even if we were divorced. i'm so confused by this and feel like if i'm putting in effort, yet he still wants to divorce, then i should just give up and move on. he gets upset with me when i ask him why i should keep trying if he's just divorcing me anyway. like he literally has a date planned for us days before our divorce is final. what do i do üò≥?	0

a mcdonald's worker saved my life tonight i was set to do it finally. my day has been nothing but flat out abusive bullying from my father which culminated in a fight and me trying to push him down the stairs from anger and a desire to just make him go away. my mum then helpfully defended him and everytime i cried and justifiably got upset cut me off and said 'i won't speak if you shout at me' i tested the waters a bit with asphyxiation, turns out the flight reflex to death is a bitch and i stopped unfortunately. i was pissed and hadn't eaten so thought fuck it, to mcdonalds! one last bad meal before i crash my car... and there they were. the most chipper guy i have ever met, he listened to me cry and was comforting me. he offered a happy meal to cheer me up and i accepted and i just thought, this guy has saved my life. if he was an asshole to me like my parents were i'd be dead now, but no he was a complete stranger and was nice to me. i left with a new drive to spite my family, i will succeed and if they don't want me anymore that's fine. i'm changing my name and moving to get away so they won't need to see me anymore and i'll be free from their bullshit. tldr: shit day, unemployed, abused by parents, mcdonalds trip, super happy guy, happy meal, fight restored and going to get the hell out of dodge soon. all hail mcdonalds, ran ran ruuu moshi moshi ronald desu ü§°	1

ex [28m] broke nc asking for me back and now i [24f] need a slap of reddit reality. he says he misses me and can't move on, that he's never been this messed up over a break up in his life, and would i please meet with him. i'm so angry at him for contacting me. i had been doing great the past few weeks--i hadn't thought about him *at all*, and now suddenly i can't get him out of my head. the day we broke up, i was done. i prepared myself to never speak to him again, even though that would mean i would never get any answers about why he suddenly turned into an absolute ass, straight out of the blue, after being mr. perfectbf‚Ñ¢Ô∏è for 6 months. we'd been friends for five years too, yet in the span of a week it went from amazing-dream to total-shit, and it felt like he kind of just threw me away. even if i was the one to actually end it, he didn't seem to care, i think it's what he wanted. i was determined to stop feeling hurt, even though there were a few times when i wanted to contact him so badly, i always pulled through and finally, after several months of feeling horribly empty, lonely, and heartbroken, i started moving on. everything started looking up for me recently, and so many new things have happened to me since the break up. i had a casual fling with someone new. i am killing it at work in a new job and doing great in my first year of grad school. i bought a new truck after being car-less for several months while we were together. i just got my first place, a little house in an awesome part of the city, after only ever living at home with my parents. on top of all of that, my lifelong battle with major depression has finally started to get under control. i know i should not care anymore! why is it so hard all of a sudden? i was over so this, but it's all blown back in with a vengeance. i am so angry that i've allowed this to set me back after so much time. reddit, tell me what you are supposed to do when this happens. has anyone else been through this? do i just try to forget it again? or do i meet with him and see what he has to say? clearly he wants to get back together, and i don't know if i want that because i don't know if he even thinks he did anything wrong--he sure didn't apologize back then. he has never known how to admit when he makes a mistake and i don't know that that's changed. the other reason is really shallow, but the fact is he has herpes and i don't want to make a worthless irreversible mistake if this falls apart all over again, so why even bother! any advice or thoughts would help a lot. my friends hate him after what happened so i can't figure out who to talk to about this. 95% of the rest of the time he was absolutely perfect and i loved him to bits. **tl;dr:** perfect-bf of 6 months/friend of 5 yrs, out of the blue, told me his first ex's vagina was better then mine right after sex. didn't apologize, ignored me for a week, and when i broke up with him over it he gave me back every single piece of crap i had left at his house and seemed totally cool with it. 5 months later, i've moved on, or so i thought. now he's begging me for forgiveness and i feel like i'm suddenly back at square one. i need help on how to move forward, or just a slap of reality from the ruthless (and usually correct) r/relationships community...	0

please stop putting soaps in ur coochieüò≠ first of all lol you don't necessarily need to even use soap at all to wash the kitty cat, just plain water does the trick ! and it's actually the most recommended but, if you are not someone that is comfortable with just washing with water, or you think you still smell without using soap then use a mild soap with no fragrance or very little. tooo many little kids (and grown teens lol) are improperly caring for themselves. vagisil, douches blah blah are not necessary ! showering once or twice a day and washing the cooter is fine. these chemically produced products are not good for your vag! unless recommended by your doctor, do not use these products, just plain soap or water. also, if you are properly washing/ keeping clean and still smell (with the exception of humid areas,athletes, exercise, physical exertion or production of sweat) then go to a doctor! every vag has a smell but if it's something that is pungent and doesn't smell like normal go to the doctor pls! and do not stick or put soap/ or chemicals / or unsafe objects into your vagina ! please no ! how to wash: *with warm water (or mild soap), use cloth or hand to open the lips (labia) and wash the creases of your vag, as well as raising up your libs to expose the clit/hood and gently clean the area *rinse *dry it's just that i've seen and heard a lot of people that don't actually know how to care for themselves and just some advice.	0

bringing my phone to a military building teaching classified information funny story, (not really) so i'm in marine mos school which is my jobs school. today i was caught with my phone.. previously we have been told electronic devices are "strictly prohibited " in huge red letters and we were given a paper to sign when we first got there. so today, i was going to chow. usually i say "yolo" and turn my phone off and put it in my backpack so that i can use it after evening chow (we don't return to the barracks till night) but today i had a mini emergency and was texting my brother. a sgt came up to me and started yelling at me, at first i kept using my phone because we as marines regularly fuck with each other like that and since there's no way of telling the difference between one of us and them since boot camp ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è when i looked up and saw his rank chevrons i shit my pants (not literally lmao) he was like "what the fuck are you doing? we dont bring our ohones to the schoolhouse... (looks at my nametape) ...evans!" i was like "aye sir" then when he finally goes away he's like "what platoon are you? (again looking at my chest for my name) ..evans" i'm like "4th platoon sgt" he walks away. the asking for name and platoon always implies they're gonna tell our superiors.. so, i get to the school house and i'm panicking. i sit there thinking about what tf i'm going to say to get out of this. the whole day passes by and i'm never told anything.. but i hatched he perfect plan. i was gonna say i left my phone in my trousers from the previous night and that i had found it there after leaving the barracks & that i was waiting for my roomate to come out of the chow hall to give it to him to take back. so, i'm not sure if anything is going to come out of this. one thing is for sure though. if he (the guy who caught me) decides to tell (maybe he forgot?) i'm getting njped.. maybe some jail time? i'm not sure if my classes in particular have classified information but, they're strict af about electronics in the building and i have a security clearance. also, my job deals with bombs (how they're made and their coded colors and what they mean) so.. i imagine it's not something they'd want an iranian to know?.. they also have these in detail bomb models all around and the windows have this metal cover that goes over the window by flipping a switch (is it too much to hope they're just to cover the sun?) but yeah.. i'm not ready to go to the brig.. tl;dr: i was caught with my phone en route to a military building teaching classified information pertaining to the building of bombs and their paint codes.	0
losing a bet and sending a messed up happy birthday message to a girl some backstory first. i am 19 years old, male and i am not at university due to conscription. i really liked this girl and asked her out like 3-4 years ago and she rejected me. a year after that i got signs that she was into me and i started talking to her only through text (sigh) but again it didn't really go anywhere. i tried to get over her by various ways but since i was so into her and my friends thought she was "psycho" (mood swings, vegan, temper, rude) she kind of became a meme in the friend group. she is now in university. this year me and one other friend (he's known her for years) sent her some random dumb pics through my fb account which she didn't respond. the last message before this was in november. now it was her birthday and my friend jokingly said to sent her something romantic. i sarcastically agreed and created a message that went along the lines of: (names, locations changed and this is a translation) my sally üíû happy birthday to you üéâ and whatever you wish for in life you should get it üòò because you really deserve it. üîù you are a unique girl with massive tits 6Ô∏è‚É£ 9Ô∏è‚É£ and nobody should stop you from being yourself. üíØ your present is waiting for you naked on the bed üîû here back home. üòâ i refused to send it but my friend was driving me crazy with texts to please send it and that it is very very funny. the group chat was split into no she will call the police and yes it is funny. i said i'll send it if he wins me at a messenger quiz game. i always beat him so i didn't really mind. i didn't know who played somebody in star trek so i lost. i immediately retracted my bet saying this is absurd, it is too much but he insisted. calling me hideous and foul names such as pussy, coward, not a man ( :o ), to not talk to him again and threatened with some violence. i tried to reason with him and i gave up and sent it. after a sort of feud in the group chat of him removing himself from what happened and calling me retarded even though we are both at fault here, i sent her another text explaining/lying to her that i lost a bet with some people i live with and that she should delete it along with a normal polite happy birthday wish. well she didn't like that. didn't find it funny. a couple days later she saw it and she texted my friend that she will call the cops, that we (friend group, even though i didn't mention them) are idiots, that she is crying her eyes out and that she doesn't care (what?). she blocked most of us on all social media and that was that for a while. today i got a text from a guy i know asking me what the fuck happened. so i guess it's spreading. if her guy friends find out it's gonna be a pain. tl;dr sent a birthday message to a girl about her tits and naked present, because of a lost bet and she was crying, almost called police and blocked me everywhere.	0
a unique and witty title that makes you wonder what is inside this present of of a post. some questions: what do you do to impress? maybe make the extra effort to dress well? keep up on jokes/comedy to help keep your humor up? cook up some great meals to share with people? etc? etc etc etc?! what kind of person do you gravitate towards? do you like being around loose fun loving types? people who love to watch and play sports? people who have an understanding of victorian era prose? what are you working on? maybe something more personal like your fitness or emotional health? a work project with jeff even though jeff is kind of a deck? some school work about a subject you didn't think you would like but damn canadian film history is pretty legit? what are some of your favorites? that red curry halibut that you don't even have to tell them you want at that one thai resturaunt because they know that's what you came for? the royal tenenbaums because wes anderson is great? jeff because even though he can be a dick at least he is honest? who do you look up to? malcolm gladwell because he does interesting things that you haven't even thought of before? lebron james because his level of passive aggressiveness is just so high? jeff for the lack of fucks he seems to give at the work place? what do you use youtube for? to keep up on new ways to do your make up or make up products because the last time you bought blindly that eye shadow just wasn't doing it? cat videos because well... cats? jeff's vlogs because outside of work he lives an interesting life full of travel and new experiences? what is a story you want to share? how you found 20 dollars in your pants pocket that got you a better lunch than you expected to have that day? how you had an elaborate plan to ask out that cutie in your bio class? that one time jeff flipped out on hr for asking him to calm down at the weekly meeting? what do you want to complain about? how micro-transactions are ruining the gaming industry? maybe that we don't have pokemon yet and its 2018? jeff talked to you through lunch while trying to enjoy a lunch that turned out better than you thought? what do you do at social gatherings? chat up the host and people you know and hit them with those new jokes you just kept up on? keep to the wall and just think about all things on youtube you could be watching right now? anything that will keep you away from jeff after watching the latest vlog where he talked about something politically charged that you just know he is going to bring up since you both aren't at work anymore? ___ thanks for reading üêª	0

a day ago i made a post about how i planned to kill myself in a year. i'm going to do it tonight. i had to write that title to confirm it. i'm going to use a rope and attach it to a wooden plank going across the top of my garage, and i'm going to use a chair to finish the job. i haven't decided which chair yet. there is no way that can fail. i won't be able to breathe. no one will check on me for a good hour or so. what changed? i don't really know. i just kind of realised that i'm well and truly finished on the 25th of november. i wish i had a cooler date but maybe this is the one god had in mind for me. i'd rather die then go back to day to day life as of now. i've just been listening to lone by tyler the creator. that will be the last song i ever hear most probably. i'll listen to music for about an hour beforehand. if anyone wants to know a bit more about me, i'm 16, male, in college. never had a girlfriend. i could've, but i didn't due to anxiety. part of me wonders if it could've been different if i was born quite good looking, and i had a girlfriend. you know, that emotional and affectionate kinda relationship with a best friend that you care about. i'm going to die a virgin but i don't think i care. ever since i got acne my self esteem plummeted, and i can't shake it off. i don't want to say acne killed me, but i think it's finishing me off. i'm passionate about football, well i was, but i've gotten too depressed to even look at a football. i don't even care to watch it anymore. nothing interests me. i only go to the gym so no one thinks there is anything wrong with me. i've been seeing a doctor but therapy is too long of a wait. haha, i hope they don't show my school photo in memorial to me. i fuckin hate that picture. i shit you not, i'm just going to put in my suicide note a personal message to my college to explicitly not put my picture on the big screen. i'm evidently insecure in the afterlife ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è my family. i don't want to talk about them. i love them too much and i hate the fact that i'm about to put them through pain but it's temporary. it's all temporary. i am a popular kid at my school. that's not me saying i'm this great cool guy at the top of the hierarchy, but there's not a single person in that college who i hate and couldn't be their friend. how do i think they'll react? i don't know. how do you react? cry? maybe for a day or two. then they'll be fine, right? funnily enough, i spent my last day ill, doing nothing, just chilling. i watched a few funny videos, i think i'm going to go on xbox later and try fortnight battle royale as people tell me it's really good. plus it's free. why am i making this post? a final message to reddit after 2 years or so. and more importantly, i want to know if any of you, have lost anyone to suicide. i want to know how people reacted afterwards. i want to know whether everyone will be okay without me. if it's attention seeking then i'm sorry for that. but i don't want to leave having said nothing at all, you know? i used to read these posts and make comments all the time about a year ago. never in my life did i think i'd be on the other side. i think that's everything. that's all of my concerns. no more schoolwork, no more stress about the future, no more pessimism, no one judging me, no more judging myself. i'm going to go have dinner. play some xbox. grab my headphones and phone, turn on my playlist, and hang myself. in 3 hours, my story will be over. crazy.	1

new girlfriend wants to take a step back, needing to vent and maybe ask for some advice **tl;dr:** new girlfriend feels shes not ready to commit to a relationship right now, needed to vent and ask for some advice. trying to stay positive about things right now we're long-distance, (8 hour drive. not impossible, but certainly not ideal. we actually have a trip semi-planned, the status of which is kind of up in the air right now. didnt feel like a good time to bring it up) met on facebook through a coworker. weve been talking since the beginning of april, and it went really well. talked nonstop for a month or so, and as things started to escalate she started to feel weird. she got out of an abusive situation a little while ago, and we were starting to bring back bad memories from that for her. so she wanted to take a step back. few days pass, and things are back to normal...mostly. shes not texting me as much, which i attribute to her needing her space. of course that's okay. few more days pass and she tells me that she wants to be official. nothing really changes, but it's all good. this was two weeks ago. sometimes i don't hear from her much for a day or two, but every time i try to give her the space she needs and things go back to normal after a bit. she tells me today that she went to her first therapy appointment, and shes realized that she cant commit to a relationship right now, for mental health reasons along with work and whatnot. too much going on, essentially. that's totally fine, i dont want her to do something that's detrimental to herself for my benefit, of course. (will include a snippet of this part of the conversation quoted at the bottom for added context, feel free to ignore)** i ask her if she still wants to be with me later, and she says of course. i ask her to promise me that if she changes her mind about us later, she wont let me keep hope where there is none. she again said of course. i'm still pretty confident that its gonna go well eventually, i know it hasn't been long but it really seems to me like i can trust she wouldnt lie about still wanting to be with me in the future, and that she will/would keep her word about letting me know if theres no hope for me to have any more. i honestly have a really, really good feeling about this long-term. idk, just a lame time right now, dont really have anyone else to talk to. kinda nervous about the future :/ last time she wanted to take a step back i was really anxious in the following days, cause things were really weird, and i just really hope that's not the case this time :/ i know i need to chill out a little bit, but it's hard right now. this is usually the bit where i would bow out, but something's telling me not to this time. i'm trying really hard to stay positive, so comments that help me with that would be greatly preferable. there may come a time when i need to hear the opposite, but i dont think that's right now. like i said, i still have a really good feeling about this on the long-term, i'm just having some trouble with the short-term. i guess my purpose for making this post, apart from just getting it off my chest, is to ask for some advice on what to do here, apart from the obvious giving space, and putting the whole 'being together' thing on the back burner, for now at least. any signs that may not be so obvious that i should look for, to tell me it's going one way or the other? (keeping in mind that since it's long distance, our only conversation will be texting) have any of you been on one side or the other of a situation like this, and it ended up working out? stuff like that. thanks for reading if you're skipping the immediate context below, even if you dont comment. just having this community here so i can get this in the open should be tremendously helpful **her: "so i had my first therapy appointment and i've realized that at this very moment i cant commit to being in a relationship. i still wanna talk and be friends but theres too much to focus on not just with my mental health but work and other things. i kinda need to take some time" me: "okay. i understand" "please dont be upset or discouraged! you're soo so wonderful really i'm trying and the last thing i wanna do is hurt or disappoint you ccm596!" "i know. do you still wanna be with me later?" "of course. just not right now. ya know" [...] me: "hey. we both know we have great things ahead of us, right? so if we need to put that on hold for now, that's okay. i have all the time in the world" (she "heart eyes" reacted to this one) "thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è" "you're welcome! i hope i'm not overstepping here, but i have a really good feeling about us, and as long as you see me in your future, then i do too" ("heart eyes" react again, no response) me again: "one more thing and then we can talk about something else lol. just..promise that if later on you change your mind about us, you wont let me keep hope where there is none. ya know? i trust you that you feel the same way i do, but i just need to ask that of you for my sanity haha" her: "of course! :)" like i said, i know i need to chill out about things, especially since this just happened today, but that's part of what i'm hoping to accomplish by posting here. thanks for reading, even if you dont comment	0

am i (28m) being toxic and overly sensitive to my long distance (27f) girlfriend by calling her out when she speaks poorly to me? hello, my girlfriend is in europe and i'm in the us. when she wakes up, it's about 3am here. relevant fact: (recently, her and i spoke about fixing our sleep schedules, for the last year i've stayed up late to be able to talk to her and also because for years before, i tend to be just a night owl. it's my habit. i am currently finding out sleep issues are possibly affecting my health and it's been something her and i talked about. also she believes her sleeping schedule is bad. i've constantly reassured her that i do not blame her, i choose to stay up late and it's not her fault.) so recently i told her i'm making efforts to fix it. anyway she always texts in her morning, which is 3am for me. i admire our time together talking and texting (we're long distance afterall, i only get a little time to talk each day). she texted me on one platform, i checked it and she saw i was online and asked "why aren't you sleeping". i said "just woke for a second :)" she said "i see :d" me: "i go back to sleep" her: "okok :3 goodnight" me: "goodnight my love" simple nothing bad. 30 minutes later she replies to a big text chat we had the previous day on a different messenger and i hear the vibrations of my phone and wake up and look. (i could've gone back to sleep, but curiosity gets me and like i said, i want to know what she says) she sees i'm online again and sends new messages saying "why arent you sleeping? bad *my name*" "xd" "from now on im not going to text you" "because i wake you up" "and instad of tryiong to sleep you just play on your phone >_>" i read those last few messages and felt a little hurt. 1: she actually means things like this. 2: imo it shows a lack of appreciation for the relationship. 3: it hurts me when she talks to me like a child. i do see that in her opinion, she claimed she said that out of care for my health. she doesn't want me sleeping bad anymore, i do see her opinion as valid and full of care, but the manner in how she decides to say it gets me upset. i replied ":(" "i just hear vibrations is all" i'm sitting here feeling bad that it feels like she doesn't appreciate that i'm up for her. but more so the ultimatum of threatening to not text me makes me feel iike she talks down to me. she said " i know üòû and i woke you up" "i dont wanna be the reason your sleeping schedule is fucked" "you should put your phone is silent mode before you sleep" this is tame and mild but i've never blamed her for ruining my sleep schedule. in the past recently and a while ago, she goes through depressed moments and tantrums about her life. she takes the blame out on me sometimes and has said things to me that project that she feels our texting and one phone call a day is a time burden to her. we discussed that, but i'm thinking this again in the moment. mainly tho, this is very mild in her tone currently, but she's had a really bad habit of talking down to me disrespectfully and without thought or care. i've grown tired of it. i've read that those habits need to be corrected starting with me calling her out on it so she begins to learn (so i've been attempting to do such lately when she speaks out), so i decided to voice what i was thinking openly here. i reply "i'm not a child, if i wake up to check my phone, then i wake up to check" "don't hold that against me üòí" "saying you'll stop texting is pretty harsh to say to your partner btw" "but you'll do what you want" "ima go back to sleep" i thought that would lead to an apology for her tone. (did i speak wrong?) i turn my phone on silent then try to sleep. this led to her spamming my phone with one word texts trying to be "cute" saying she didn't mean to upset me and she's just making a solution. and she ends with "are you asleep or you just being butthurt" "even tho i didnt mean to make you mad, you just took it offensive" "because this is so fashionable these days" i read the last part as a huge redflag for me. by "fashionable these days" she meant because recently when she attacks me or acts out of line, i try to be logical and address it how it's not healthy for the relationship. the times when i thought i addressed it correctly and came to a mutual understanding with her, she actually didn't come to a true understanding. so i called her and the conversation went mild at the start. in the conversation i expressed that i get that she feels guilty and cares for me, but likewise if i wake up for a little, it's because i want a little time with her. she doesn't need to look negatively on this. i told her that saying the "ultimatum" comes across as not valuing the relationship. the continuance of the phone talk is a topic for a new thread itself. i tried to stay logical, but in the talk she spoke down to me a bunch, the biggest things she said was "i feel iike a mother taking care of a kid right now" "i'm dealing with a child" "you're being a little bitch." each rude thing i told her that she's being so damn disrespect to me and she needs to stop speaking to me like this. she has this habit of during serious conversations she can only be sarcastic with mean jokes and forced laugh at everything. it felt like a mess. i tried to express how my biggest dislike in people is when they disrespect me. and she told me "if so many people don't respect you, then there's something wrong with you." i ended up trying to talk about how she comes across never to value me or my opinion while i'm always verbally talking her up and being so proud of her for what's she's accomplished and thinking highly of her. i tried to express that it's both how and what she says to me that isn't healthy. and i expressed that she's closed off to letting me lead and be the man in the relationship she got a little serious and said that she's always been alone and dealing with people who treat her poorly. so she defends herself first. i ended up saying sorry for starting the whole argument and being sensitive (and for also making her late for her plans... saying this lowered my masculinity value a lot) i guess in the end we came to a quasi-understanding though.... although i tried to make it a bigger conversation to try and communicate what we think about eachother, and why she speaks to me so, and why i've started to voice my disapproval of her behavior... ultimately... the end of the phone talk ended with her venting as usual and ranting to me about her mom pestering her and having to go out with friends today. she was late going to her friends so we could talk, so i appreciated she valued trying to communicate, but i feel there was no good true conclusion to our talk. i think maybe i'm flustered and venting here now. i'm not sure if this even makes sense to an outside perspective. i'm stressed and worried for the relationship. i don't want to treat her bad. i love her. but she also scares me with how she speaks to me. and it scares me that she has a low value of me, i don't want a relationship where my partner thinks low of me for no good reason. and her inability to have a true serious heart to heart make me think she has mental instability issues. i'm not sure how to handle her or if i'm to blame. tl;dr i'm starting to verbally call out when my girlfriend starts to be disrespectful to me. she's claiming i'm becoming overly sensitive but truth is, i just let her slide all along. and she exaggerates that now i'm accusing her of ruining the relationships all the time. in just this isolated incident i've outlined, i'm trying to understand if i'm to blame.	0
i'm going to the hospital, i hope it's late. i'm scared. its hard to read my phone through these tears. i can't handle this pain any more and i don't know where else to go, i don't even know why i'm typing this. i hope i take myself there and dont follow through with a different plan. wherever this night takes me, i hope i don't feel this way much longer. üíî	1

i survived! üôÇ its officially been a month. august 16th, 2018. worst day of my life so far. i'm in junior high. august 16th was results day for us. i felt i did great in biology, okayish in chemistry and pretty bad in physics after the finals. turned out i flunked chem and physics and didn't do as well as i thought in biology. i had a terrible feeling on the day all throughout morning. as i was on vacation away from home at my relatives, i would be getting a digital copy of my results through an email. just about an hour or so before the times we were expected to recieve emails, i made sure no one was watching me. i grabbed my phone, a rifle and some pellets. i headed up to the terrace and hid somewhere. i typed out my suicide note on my phone. thanking everyone in my family and apologizing at the same time. i loaded the rifle and waited. time went on and suddenly i heard a buzz on my phone. there it was. i got a notification from the gmail app, with my name on it. i was hesitant to even open up the notification. as my finger trembled to open up the pdf attached to the email, i started sweating intensely. filled with fear, i managed to open it up. my heart dropped. i stopped crying as i was in abseloute shock. i couldn't believe my eyes. i had done much worse than expected. i dropped my phone and aimed the gun towards my head, whilst saying several prayers in my head. i managed to bring my finger near the trigger. i was again extremely hesitant to pull it. just then , i heard my mom coming up tbe stairs calling out my name as i had been gone for a while now. i dropped the rifle and just stared at the ground. long story short, had a long talk with my parents. basically, i wanted to do medicine, and they would immediately reject me as my grades wouldnt fit into thier requirements. we all decided along with the principal, that for me to get a higher chance at getting into a good university would be to repeat the year. a lot of ppl in around the same position as me who also wanted to go for medicine are going into senior year but all have an obstacle. as in some are doing another 4 course before med school and apply to medicine post graduate. some have completely moved on to another job field. meanwhile the majority are resitting individual exams at the end of the year plus exams from senior year which is super stressfull. so in the long run, i think what i went with is the best for me. i'm stressing now because i feel isolated and alone as i lost all my friends. however in 8 months time, im not going to have to go crazy unlike quite a few. life is life. i learned my lesson. ima fix all the shit up and move on. thank you mom ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

please read suicide does not end the chances of life getting worse, suicide eliminates the possibility of it ever getting better. all we can do is stay strong and keep moving. tough times never last, but tough people do last. we just have to fight. life is worth living no matter the circumstances. create your own happiness. my friend once told me dont spend all your time trying to find yourself. spend your time creating yourself into a person that you'll be proud of. we all have diffrent journeys in life. but we need to find our right path to take and it will take time but believe in yourself. we can all get through this and find some happiness. i promise. this pain is only temporary. keep moving. keep smiling. keep pushing yourself, and most importantly, live your best life because we only get one üíö	1

an uninteresting title.i utterly hate my life. i honestly don't even know what to do at this point. i want to die but my step brother killed himself and i don't want to put my family through it. my family consists of a sister whom i hardly get along with, a father i don't talk much to, a mother who really isn't and never was a mother, and a nana who sends random memes everyday who doesn't understand quite how depressed i truly am. i've spent many days after work just sitting trying to muster the motivation to do something but cannot. i had an ex that ruined me financially whom i put first completely, this resulted in me losing many (all) of my friends (if i even had any let's be real). i use weed (canadian so it's illegal not that it matters anyway) to pretty much ignore my life. i am out of weed and honestly don't feel comfortable driving atm due to some crazy suicidal thoughts. i've been depressed since i can remember and self harmed quite a bit in my younger years as well as a few times in the more recent years (23 years old). i'm very tired of trying, i'm tired of not having a family, i'm tired of being lonely. i feel so guilty about everything because everything's been blamed on me my entire life (my mother literally blamed me for my parents divorce when i was 12 or 13). i've fucked up everything i've ever had or done. i really don't know what this post will even accomplish. hope you're entertained i guessü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è	1

sad story of my life sad story of my life **tldr** - >!smile, please this is not happy story!< hello everyone, i would like to share with you an unpleasant story from my life (maybe more from the last 10 years) that will not have a happy ending. i apologize for style, but i am neither a writer nor english is not my native language.for a very long time i thought to write my stories so that everyone could read it. i didn't want to throw it on christmas or the new year, to not disturb anyone this time, the more so once again that i wanted to try to smile at the recipient of secret santa. i didn't want to throw it in the vicinity of my birthday in the same way. today, when i have less and less strength and prospects for a better tomorrow, i think it's the last call for it. forgive for long and boring introduction time to say something about me, i am already a rather old man (as much as 30 years old) from a country in europe, maybe some of you will infer from which, for now living in the capital city. a series of worse and worse misfortunes began perversely from the trip during which i said " from now everything will be fine, no worries" if i knew how much that's words were stupid. two days from these words i participated in a car accident, which is interesting then i experienced my only fracture - eye socket, from stories i know that the surgery lasted for many hours and the exhausted doctor told my mother that life was saved. well, i spent two weeks in the hospital. then a month at home where my only exit was a trip to the hospital on medical examination i don't recommend this condition and anabolics after which there are various strange dreams: /i survived, i feel the effects to this day but it is not a tragedy.after the accident, i came back to university, i even got to the next ones, but i did not start the same as i did not finish the first ones even though it only one exam. left. you'll probably ask why? well, after the accident, my relationship with one person important to me broke down. but something else happened. something no one expected.the house that my great-grandfather built in the 1950s, in which my grandfather lived (unfortunately died in 2012, through stress and these situation ), mother and i have been living since birth. unfortunately, due to the history and the very behavior of my country and the city. our house for which we have always looked after, we've done renovations, we have brought water from a well, or electricity has been given to "alleged owners". without our knowledge or any question in very unclear circumstances, maybe even breaking the law, but who cares? we just got an enigmatic letter and so much silence.it was in 2011 and later we will come back to this. due to lack of money, i decided to take up full-time jobs (previously i worked while studying on weekends). in college, i could not focus even though i tried : / unfortunately i was alone without any support. in 2012, i started working in a company as it seemed to me very good and where i would grow. the more so because we cooperated for a giant in the industry. and my contribution from the very beginning was continuous and required a huge amount of time. what exactly happened at the time because i did not have to think about problems and that i worked 12-14 hours a day or on weekends? i worked and enjoyed it. well, but how could this idyll not last because it would be too beautiful. after 3 years, i was released. from day to day. on saturday night i came back from a business trip and on monday after working hours i got information "end of work"it is also like no tragedy, right? true, if not a small detail. from the beginning of 2015, they were receiving a payment for me. previously, there were only delays. you know 5-10 days. no problem. i am a conciliatory man and i'm not brawling.unfortunately, for 6 withdrawals i received only 2 and no money for overtime.i asked, i asked. it did not do anything. unfortunately, i was forced to go to the orchard. despite my reasons and the huge amount of evidence, i was afraid. and you know what? rightly. the case went on for a long time. i am alone without a lawyer. because as you know - "no money = no lawyer"the result of the matter is absurd and negative. my loss despite presenting a lot of evidence and challenging one, only one! proof of the other party which was my signature which does not look like mine at all : /and so the injured person became even more vulnerable because the system does not defend the weaker. and i lost a large amount of money. which i lose hope that i will recover. let's go back to 2014, when the new "owners" of our house demanded money. the amount is not small again. of course, neither courts nor authorities, despite requests and presenting their reasons, do not want to help. because why help people like us. the whole situation will probably end up landing on the street ‚òπÔ∏è ‚òπÔ∏è without money or other means of livelihood.dear ones, the above situations have meant that i have not been sleeping well for many years. i also think that depression begins to get on me more and more. because it would not be too colorful, it's not the only thing that touched me.a few years back it turned out that my mother has sick kidneys: / even very, stage 3 or 4. such irony because we have too easy in life. mom is already years old and has to take great care of herself. unfortunately, constant stress is not easy. and i cannot lie saying that everything will be fine. because i see that it is notif you were wondering about one thing. yes, i work i earn, unfortunately, the amount is way too small. and when i think that i will be without everything with unjust debts. i think that this life does not make any sense. even work, because you know how to work only to give away everything . evil and degrading perspective ‚òπÔ∏è. this is a damn bad and a downward perspective ‚òπÔ∏è. just as it was depressing that a person, a woman whom i loved more than a life after more than 2 years, decided that someone like me - poor, without money, father, no fact decided to add that ugly fat and stupid;\];\] is completely nothing worth. i loved her very much, she knew it perfectly well, she also thought of me, but who knows? since she lied to me on many issues because she liked her so much and wanted to be always the center of attention. honestly, when i was not alone, i felt some support that gave me strength. and now? i have nothing and nobody. after all those years....it's stupid to say, but i'm afraid that if someone needed help, i'd be the first to help. so maybe she went right with my stupidity? i'm afraid every day, because everyone can bring something worse than the previous one. i do not have the strength to look after others like i used to. i will not give myself because i have neither strength nor strength. (you know the treatment costs too)i did not think that he would write something like that from his heart. maybe a bit chaotic but how true. at the end, for those who have read all this, i would like to apologize for taking their time, but also to thank. i also want it while it still lives and have any strength to say that if any of you have any problems, need to talk to someone, my inbox is open to you. i have always been a good and empathic listener thanks to which i managed to help me somehow. because if for me there is no rescue from these hopeless situations, at least i will try to help. you, as well as you, but also you. i know what it's like to be alone with everything when everything collapses. i will try to listen and help, all the best. read the tldr at the top!	0
272 days until i overdose and hopefully find something more story time fuckers,i'm not depressed lol funny right?! let me paint a mental picture i am 24 years old i'm tall with straight brown hair and i'm white af i live in canada graduated highschool just barley and have accomplished well nothing but learning how to think as an individual. i'm not like disabled or crazy or unhealthy i would say i'm just i guess different. so i work at a convince store (my first job) i currently have stable housing situation rent is a little high but not at all unaffordable i am able to save and i have no debts i would say i am just a lost dude, i have social barriers that i enact to keep people away obviously i do not have a love life and remain distant from intimate connections, i have no friends or people i'm close with. i do not have many issues but one of the big ones is never being able to be financially free to basically persue what i need and want, i feel as if i'm slowly dying inside to the point that i'm just going to snap one day, i cannot handle this never ending pointless work to just barely get a taste of what i could get if i work hard lol some will say i'm lazy and i am to a degree but this life burns me out everything is just so boring and primitive for me. everyday i wake up dreading the experience i have to live through wich compared to (lol) a lot of things in this world is laughable for me. some might think hey fucker you sound entitled maybe?? i'm looking for something more and there is just nothing but void for me, i have tried a lot of things like meditation and hallucinating on dmt and mushrooms praying to god.now therapy normally i would be all over but i believe most if not all therapists are bias and there judgement is skewed on the best course of action for me as a person. basically in conclusion i think i might be damaged goods so the best recourse for my person would be self termination in the most painless way possible. here's hoping üòè if you feel like it shoot me a message or comment it would be at least entertaining.	1
eating meat well, i just had the most unforgettable dinner of my life. the meal included a dish of egg casserole, a dish of fried vegetables and a dish of boiled vegetables (i know how stupid it sounds to have 2 dishes of vegetables for a meal, but whatever). everything was going just fine until i finished my meal, i could feel something stuck in my throat. at first i thought it was a bit of the boiled vegetables i just had, so tried to eat some rice, some more vegetables (lol), and even a banana to help bring it down. after all those attempts, it even seemed worse, that thing started poking at my throat. i was just about to give up and forget about it when i looked at my throat in the mirror, and guess what, it was a fucking hair of a pig from the egg casserole. can't believe i swallowed it without realising it. needless to say, i freaked out, asked my family to confirm the nightmare, and tried to get it by myself. lol of course i couldn't and had to use the help of my mom. the very thought of going to a doctor if we couldn't do it just scared the shit out of me. luckily, this is a he story so it didn't go any further. don't wanna mention the process though üòí to make everything worse, i made the egg casserole üí© tl,dr: i had some egg casserole with a pig's hair, swallowed it and had it stuck in my throat.	0

failed attempt - my gun miss fired...i was all alone sitting on a rock at the edge of a cliff. it was the prefect weather outside and the moon was shining. i felt emptiness and nothing i've been taking anderall the past week and rarely ate plus with sleep deprivation i felt no emotions whatsoever. i posted yesterday and i decided to reply back to everyone before i went through with pulling the trigger. reading through the comments at the time i just didn't even care what any of you had to say. all of you sounded so dumb... not even going to lie. how are you going to beg and miss someone that you don't even know. i bet if i vented to you guys for couple weeks straight you'd have enough of my shit and leave me on read. anyway i still replied and i read through everything... why idk i love all you‚ù§Ô∏è than i tossed my phone off the cliff and pulled my hand gun from my backpack. i sat there reflecting my life for about an hour than finally when it was dead silent and i just felt all alone consumed in my thoughts i put the metal behind my ear and pulled the trigger. this has to be some kind of sick joke... nothing came out i held my stance and just waited for something to happen. nothing happen... i instantly became so upset and i tossed the gun off the cliff and sat there all night crying.... eventually i got up and went back home. my parents were about to wake up and i got back just in time and slid into my room. i slept majority of the day feeling a bit better. i don't know what to say right now... i don't know what to do. i'm using one of my old phones currently you guys deserved an update. i'm working as a intern right now my manger is going to question me tomorrow for not coming in what am i going to say... fml i have the worst luck but i guess it's not my time to go yet.	1

really tired of women deciding that i'm not enough at the extreme risk of sounding like an incel/nice guy/neckbeard/whatever the fuck you want to call it, i'm really really tired of being pushed aside by women i pursue. i'm 22, attractive, have a job, outgoing, and in my not so humble opinion, interesting. you'd think that would be enough for just one person to try and make a relationship work with me, but in two and a half years of being single, all i ever hear is "i'm not looking for a relationship" or "now is not the right time because xyz" or "i don't think of you that way." i've tried talking to friends about it and all they ever seem to do is tell me everything that i'm doing wrong and everything wrong with *me* instead of actually maybe helping me find someone or giving me any constructive advice. a while back i gave in and got a tinder account, against my own personal wishes (i'd rather meet someone irl) and though i've gotten several matches over the months, eventually *even those* women decide that it just won't work. it's really really easy to look at this scenario and say "well the obvious answer is that it's you. you're the common denominator in these attempts at getting a relationship." i realize that. i've made great efforts to improve myself as a person. but i'm at the point now where even some of my friends have no idea why i'm still single. it just makes me feel like shit because nobody wants me and i just graduated college which means it's now about 50x harder to meet anyone because i'm not constantly surrounded by hundreds of girls my age anymore. i'm tired of being alone... i'm not an incel, i'm not a nice guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, and i'm not a neckbeard. i'm just a normal dude who has had *abismal* luck in the dating world...	0

pushing people away is fun!!i love this! i never thought it'd be so easy! just basically be a bitch, and that's it. yesterday, i pushed my mom away by yelling at her for throwing away my money(it was a check; on the seat of my car...made her feel like shit). i'm pushing my "fiance" away by threatening to leave his house. i hate my dad already, so yeah...just basically tell him.... i know i sound bad, but it's actually working. maybe i can get all my "family" to hate me even more...my fiance's family hates me anyway, so they don't have to be pushed away as much. then i'll kill myself once that's done. i'll be dead, and then nobody has to worry about taking the trash(me)out. i'd be dead. the coroner would show up, they'd do something to me, and i'd be dead and free of living. have tears in my eyes just thinking about it. how happy it makes me. i just want to be alone when i die. have no one there. i'll be as cold as i was when i was alive. no one will give a single shit. i'll be dead. dead to people who *used* to love me. i'm better dead, anyway. can't be mean to anyone. haven't gotten any good karma. been trying to change that, but people still see me as a bad person, so i will always be a bad person. gave up trying to change that. nobody will ever love meüñ§ i wasn't meant to live a successful filling lifeüíï goodbye allüñ§	1
i just don't think i can keep living this miserably.i come from a very abusive family. my parents have done a lot that's really fucked up the ways that i think about myself...i constantly feel like i have no control over my life. it's like everything i see reminds me of some past trauma. it seems like all the help online is "all situations change" but i don't think my mental state will ever change. it's just becoming too much to cope with. i just feel like i'm done living and i don't want to have to deal with all of these bad thoughts inside my head any longer. the only reasons i haven't killed myself yet is because i have a boyfriend who is the nicest, sweetest guy on the planet, and i love him so much, and i'm worried that if i kill myself he'll kill himself too. my parents, who are manipulative and narcissistic and believe they can do no wrong, will never blame themselves, and they'll probably blame my boyfriends and my friends and make them feel responsible. but another part of me knows that my friends will protect my boyfriend and that all of them will know my parents are responsible... i just feel like i never have any freedom or any chance to make choices about my life, and this would finally be my escape from all of this. edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. honestly posting this and talking about how i was feeling with some people close to me really helped me feel better. i'm feeling much better today thanks to all of you wonderful people. i hope you all have a great day, and i hope anyone reading this who felt like i did yesterday feels better too. ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

i am being forced to use reddit my mother (52f) is very uptight. she is very old school, so she doesn't allow any sort of slip-up. she is not overly protective, but she clamps down hard when she thinks i'm up to no good. i am a good student, a's in all my classes but gym (stupid gym class), and do my chores every weekend. this includes the dishes, trash, bathrooms (3 of them), cleaning my room, and babysitting my little brother when my mother goes out. i respect her very much, but she does one thing that really bugs me. she forces me to use reddit. i use it pretty often to find communities of people or share something i found, but that is not enough for her. she orders me to use it everyday with no excuses. if i miss a day, i lose my dinner for that night. miss another day that week, i lose my lunch and dinner on that day. i try to make time for it, but i have lots of schoolwork to do. i asked her the other day about why i need to use reddit, but she didn't really give me an answer. all she said was "wholesome 100 is the way, we pray to the reddit gods each day. while away, in the reddit bay, we do not forget to play the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è vote games. laugh at the lame, you have a bigger brain than anyone aboard the tiktok train. this is the way, we shall be, as reposting is right and a right it shall be."	0

i am so fucking sad right now i'll probably delete this post cause i never know who's looking but i just wanted to vent for a second and i have no real friends i can vent to. my best friend, my wife has blocked me from all affection lately. is it my fault? probably. i haven't been the best husband over the years but if i was being honest she hasn't been the best wife. but that doesn't matter. especially since a lot of the things that i feel like sucked about her behavior grew from my own shitty behavior and her reaction to it. but i felt like we always found a way to get past that. for better or for worse. it always seemed like no matter what happened we would have each others backs forever. these last few weeks have been among the worst of my life. my wife has been growing more and more distant. it was similar to the last time when she left me. and no matter what i do or say, she deflects my attempts at building bridges. the worst kick in the stomach lately was when i sent her just a random text just a random message to let you know i'm thinking about you and i love you ‚ù§Ô∏è hope your having a wonderful day her reply thank you. just got dinner in the oven and about to shower. now i know how she'd react if she sent me something like that to her. she'd cry her eyes out. not meeting i love you with i love you hurts. and i guess. i'm just hurting right now. i just want to crawl into a little hole and die. she usually picks me up from work but i think tonight i'll walk. i just want to be alone with my sadness. is that stupid. i don't know. but i just hurt so damn bad right now. anyway. thanks internet for listening. you're my only friend right now.	0

i just had my heart broken, and i feel hopeless i was just dumped by my girlfriend the other night, and i don't know what to do. "i can't really say i'm in love with you" is what she said. this just came out of nowhere and i feel like i can't breathe. just a couple of days ago i thought we were still madly in love, now i'm heartbroken and i feel like i'm going to have a nervous breakdown. i just wish i knew what went wrong. i wish she would tell me that i did something wrong, tell me that i fucked up, tell me i had abhorrent personality traits, at least then i could make some sense of it. but she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. she likes me, and cares about me, but she's not in love with me anymore. how am i supposed to react to that? how can you say you love me on sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on friday? she keeps insisting that i didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am i supposed to understand that? i'm just hurt and confused. she stopped by my house the other night to return some things i left in her apartment, my shirt she had (and it still smells like her üò¢ ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents i gave her for valentines this year. i don't know what i'm gonna do. i spent all night crying, i feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. it's like i'm trapped in a nightmare i can't wake up from. whenever i was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. despite all the bullshit i deal with on a daily basis, i always felt alright, because i knew that no matter what happened i had her beside me, and she made everything alright. i honestly don't know how i'm gonna make it through winter without her. our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and i was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. but when dumping me she was just so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. we were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to react. she said she doesn't see us having a future together; i saw us potentially getting married one day, i definitely saw a future with her. and she used to see one with me, i just don't know what changed. i don't know how to deal with this. without her i just feel dead inside. just last week i was so happy, now i don't know how i'm gonna live without her. she was the best thing that ever happened to me, now i feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. she said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. i don't think i could ever find anyone else as amazing as her. the only one i feel like i can turn to at this moment is my best friend. they try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but i'm a crying mess right now, and i don't feel ready to try to date again; but they are making me go back to online dating and i don't really feel strong enough to object right now. i've never felt this hurt and empty. i don't know how i'm supposed to make it through this.	0

can someone please help me :( there's so many threads on here wow. i apologize for the length of this post!!! i'll be so grateful for anyone who reads!!! üòî well essentially for my whole life ever since i was 13, everything has been on a downward spiral. i'd always convince myself to keep trying. i'd try to get good grades, try to make friends, but here i stand 6 years later... no friends. not a single one since 13. anyway i also struggled with my weight for a long time, i managed to lose weight but by doing so i destroyed my body because i have excess skin. so that didn't work out. i'm never going to have sex which sucks. i also have a spine condition that creates a hunchback and i have really bad acne scarring. anyway the main trigger now is that i am currently in college ( just started ) and in one particular course my brother and i would work on assignments together. however we recently discovered this was considered cheating. and we are in big shit for it... i have an exam for that course. i'm not going to continue after this semester.... when i drop out i'm not sure what i'm going to do.. maybe i'll just become homeless haha but i was sorta hoping to work up the courage to kill myself. it's so hard to do though.. i know my dad has a hunting rifle but idk how to load it... i think i've decided on carbon monoxide poisoning as that seems like the best way to go.., anyway as of right now i'm pretty sure i won't do it quite yet but if i get kicked out of the course maybe, i ruin everyone's life... this whole "working together" thing was my idea... so i probably ruined his chance at college. my dad and my step mom both hate me ( which is okay because i hate them as well ). due to being so lonely i resorted to making online friends and most of them ditched me which is fair but a few stuck around. i make their lives worse though and i'm sure they just talk to me out of pity. i really want someone to care about me as i'm a completely worthless human ( don't say i'm not worthless. this is nothing new to me. i've thought about this extensively and i have absolutely nothing to offer anyone or the world ) anyway i had to get this off my chest because of this school stuff happening now... this could very well mean the end of my sad life üòû which really sucks because i always told myself ever since 13 "just stick it out. it'll get better. you'll lose weight, make friends and be happy" i don't want my life to end like this ugh haha sorry. any advice from anyone who stuck around to read it? ‚ò∫Ô∏è i'd be very grateful!	1

my friend [21m] owed me money and when he refused to give it to me [21f] my other friends gave him the money to give to me. he pocketed the money. over two months ago i booked an airbnb for my friends and i for spring break. i put it on my card, and all but one of my friends paid me back. last minute he pulled out because he couldn't afford to go, despite the fact that we cancelled our original reservation to accommodate him. i had the foresight to know this would happen, and so i was annoyed. i was stuck paying his portion. when we discussed it, i told him i felt bad about him paying for a room he wouldn't be sleeping in, so he could just pay me whatever he thought was fair. fast forward to beginning of may, he hadn't paid me back a cent. honestly, i dropped it. i hate asking for money, even if it's for someone to pay me back. however, unexpectedly, my laptop broke and it was gonna cost hundreds to fix it, and i didn't have that money. i reluctantly texted him asking him if he could pay me back, not even all of it, just some of it because i really needed it. my classes started soon and i needed my laptop. i felt bad for even asking, and was very apologetic. at first he said he forgot, then he said "you can't ask \[my boyfriend's name\] to pay for it? üòí" i said no, and continued to be apologetic. he said he couldn't pay me back all of it because he "wouldn't be able to eat all week" (he means won't be able to eat out every day) so he gave me 30% of what he actually owed me, 40% of what i asked him. he said he would give me the rest when he got paid the following week. as you could guess, he never gave me the rest. it's been weeks since my laptop has been broken, and my mom eventually just gave me the money to pay for it. i texted our other mutual friend (who went on the trip) about how i was annoyed. she told me how she was with him when i asked for the money and that he was "irrationally angry" about it and asked her what she thought. when she said she didn't think anything of it, he got mad at her. she said he made a big deal out of it and was upset he paid for a trip (he didn't) that he didn't get to go on and was complaining about it for a long time. to both of our surprises, she told me that she and our other friend who also went on the trip sent him the money to give to me because they "thought they were saving a friendship." instead of doing that, he pocketed the money they gave to him to give to me. she then realized he spent that money on juul pods. i'm absolutely livid. it's not about the money to me, i wouldn't have even asked for it had i not had an emergency. it's that he repeatedly said he'd pay me back and didn't, complained to my friend that he "paid for a trip he didn't go on" when he knew damn well that he was gonna bail before i even booked it but let me do it anyway, gave me an attitude when i asked him to pay me back the money he owed me, and claims he's broke but can spend hundreds to feed his nicotine addiction. i'm just totally in shock that someone i considered to be my best friend would treat me like that. i'm unsure what to do. naturally, i want to confront him but i don't want to throw my other friend under the bus. letting it go is really not an option because i really don't know how i can even look at him the same way anymore. what should i do next? ask for the money back? ask him to pay my friends back? i don't care about it but i want him to know that i know what he did and how shitty it was. tldr; friend owed me money because he bailed out of a trip that i paid for last minute. i didn't ask him to pay me back, until months later when i needed it for an emergency. he was rude about it, talked shit behind my back about it, and refused to pay me the full amount. when our mutual friends gave him the rest of the money to give to me, he kept it. what should i do?	0
my life hey reddit.. im a almost 16 year old guy, let's start with that. the past 3ish years has been me basically picking up (may be some off) about 22 charges against me.. in and out of hospitals(inpatient mostly).. been to juvy three times.. been in therapy my entire life since my sister shot and killed herself when i was maybe 7. this post is somewhat about suicide.. recently i've been really struggling to keep my head up, my court cases are on hold.. im on house arrest.. because of my actions (yes i recognize i caused alot to most of everything wrong happening to me now) i have ruined so many things. especially family relationships.. basically put everything i said together and add i don't have good terms w family which is starting to get to me after a year or so.. kind of jumping all over place but let's cut to the chase.. overall my life is shit. like it is literally fucking horrible. and honestly i'm rlly starting to lose hope and rlly want to just do something, anything to escape it all. suicide i dont really see as an answer but there's no other ones.. someone please just say anything in response to this because i domt even know who i am anymore because im losing my mind to all these shitty things going for me. thanks ‚ù§Ô∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	1

i [20f] am unbearably anxious over an unsure friendship w/ a former fwb [22m]. tldr: should i remain friends with somebody who only treats me like an acquaintance now? in short, i was friends with benefits with someone i felt extremely close to. he told me he didn't have any romantic feelings for me, which i respected, but i was still at his house almost every day. i'm not sure how close he felt to me to be honest. at any rate, i told him i didn't like him, in a humorous manner. you know how you casually roast the friends that are close to you? (maybe not ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.) anyways, i said something "to that effect" more than once apparently and because of that he said he didn't wanna have sex with me anymore but we could still be friends as usual. immediately after however, he pretty much stopped talking to me or hanging out with me as often. he considers himself to be very self-reflective and emotionally mature so i approached him about it, and he said he'd just been busy. we then planned a link. in total we've probably gotten together 2-3 times in the almost 4 months since we stopped having sex. i think in comparison to some other friends i have, this isn't bad. but in comparison to how often i used to talk to this guy, it's a bummer. i'm still hung up on what happened. at one point, i questioned him at a thousand miles a minute about his motives and objectives about what transgressed. he answered, but i'm still not at peace. i understand he's the victim here and somehow having sex with me made him feel used, but the fact that he would interpret what i said so seriously after admitting to understanding it as a joke makes me disappointed in myself for what i did on one part and also him for having such an understanding of my person that out of all things a joke would be what ended it for him. i don't care about the sex anymore. but the whole situation has festered some animosity in me towards him. though on the other hand i feel obligated to remain his friend to prove that i truly cared about him up until that point. now, i'm not so sure. he has quite literally ignored my texts more than once where before we used to text throughout the day, everyday. and when we do talk in person, he doesn't try harder than "how are you?". it feels like we're simply acquaintances. i feel like i have to constantly pester him with questions for him to open up like a normal friend. then he gets bothered by the questions and says that this is an "inorganic" way to develop a friendship. the one time he dug deeper than "how are you?" and asked me questions they were all about himself and my feelings towards him. he asked me if i liked him romantically which i've discussed with him before when we were intimate. (i told him that i was a bit surprised he felt nothing for me romantically but that i liked him, though i couldn't ascertain whether it was platonic or romantic). i personally felt that the question and all of them in general could only benefit his ego and make me vulnerable. it felt selfish and that his only curiosity about me had nothing to do with me myself. the fact that his presence around me has changed so much makes me dislike him more. otherwise i'm thinking this was always him and i was blinded by it since he gave me so much attention at one point. he often comes off as pretentious and self-important. i'm constantly anxious about where i stand with him. every night i overanalyze what i originally said for him to cut off the benefits. and when i decide that i should stop creating that anxiety for myself (as he's answered all my questions), i then move on to question our current relationship. is it worth it to be friends? am i only feeling this way / projecting because of what happened? would cutting him off just confirm his opinions of me? what bothers me most is he's virtually emotionless. he told me what i said made him feel bad but his explanation was a scholarly essay about the meaning of language and the philosophy of repeated phrases. not actually, but i mean to say his reasoning was more pseudo-academic than anything. i asked him why even be friends if his philosophy determined that i really didn't like him and he said, i'm "mean" and he didn't want to be "close" to me but "engaging" with me as a friend only is tolerable. i understand if he feels that way but to try to be friends with someone who feels this way about me is hard and frankly i'm offended. he said that he does consider me to be a good friend but words aren't my "love language". more than anything, whether i remain friends with him or not, i really want this anxious feeling to go away. any advice towards this would be much appreciated. please help.	0
advice please. ‚ù§Ô∏èhello. my names kayra. i'm 14 years old and in my second year of high school, my friend committed suicide and i have no freaking idea what to do with myself. she passed away little over three months ago, and i'm a mess. i get counselling once a week, i'm on anti depressants and i constantly ask my self what if i had said something to her or told her that we loved her, would she still be here? would she be okay? would she see how many people truly care and adored her. i miss her everyday and the thought of never seeing her ever again brakes my heart and i don't know how to comprehend and understand the fact that she's never coming back. i couldn't go to her funeral either and i regret that everyday. i keep having dreams about her and i keep seeing her lifeless and it causes panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. i wish i could just see her once again, i really don't know what to do or how to deal with this. can someone please just help me.	1

please help mefor the first time in my life i called a suicide hotline and the guy was very helpful. unfortunately i had to cut it short because my family got home and i'm ashamed i called. what would they think if they knew. would they think i'm insane? have me committed? and my boyfriend? we both have issues with depression but i'm medicated for it. he's so supportive but i'm terrified to tell him i'm contemplating this. and my doctor. i lve been considering going to her and asking for something prn like xanax or ativan but idk what to do, or if i tell her about my call to the suicide hotline? will that go in my record? i'm just... i don't know what to do anymore. please someone help me edit: hey everyone, just wanted to let everyone know i'm okay. i told my family and my boyfriend. they were super understanding, and i just went to the doctor. he put me in contact with some resources and also prescribed me something as needed for anxiety and sleep. thank you everyone for your concern and help üíô	1
using a squatty potty *actually happened today* "my first experience with a squatty potty" for those that don't know, a squatty potty is a stepstool-like device that goes around your toilet, enabling and lifting your feet and legs to be in an optimal üí© position. i myself had never had the luxury of trying one. just an old fashioned shitter, i guess. so i'm staying with a friend, and i see, lo and behold, that they have one! so i'm like "ok lets do this." i sit down, and begin to put my feet up in what i'm calling the "shit stirrups" and begin to do what comes naturally. thats when the literal shitstorm happened. to set the scene you must know something about me. (here's the tmi part, last chance to escape before i say it) my dick is a grower, not a shower. that means in flaccid form, it is a tiny turtle head. why am i telling you this? because the angle my legs and hips were in, with my feet on the squatty, mixed with a small flaccid penis, made my dick pop out of the toilet, mid stream. i am now pissing on myself and the floor. in an adrenaline rush i try to stand up, you know, to stop pissing on my friends floor. that action makes the step slide out from beneath me, swinging my whole body backwards, and i start shitting on the lip of the toilet seat. at that point all i could do was finish. spent 1/2 an hour cleaning the bathroom, all while cussing out the squatty potty. my life folks. sometimes messy sometimes shitty always interesting tl;dr used squatty potty, peed on self and floor, slipped and shit everywhere	0

my experience with free therapy u.s.a. over age 45, for the middle aged readers i have posted here quite a bit, recently. some of my posts drew ire. i'm unable to endure some of the things people here have endured long term, thru their similar challenges. some people who became homeless can endure living in a tent, a shelter, taking free handouts & working low wage survival jobs with no dental or healthcare & living with strangers. after 3 years, i can not. i'm done. not everyone can endure living that way for long periods of time at mid age. some qualify for ssi/ssdi & medicaid. i do not. i have knowledge about the so called "resources & programs" & healthcare administration. it requires extensive medical documentation & acknowledgement of education & occupational skill level evaluations with voc rehab & doctors. what got us here isnt for the same reasons. but the system is designed to keep people enslaved, dependent, poor & deprived of autonomy & dignity. some people who were raised in poor homes can adapt. not everyone can. this is what draws ire from those who have endured. we're not all the same. i went to a non-profit mental health center in 2018 and a free county/state paid mental health clinic, to speak with a m.d. psychiatrist. this was due to job push outs at mid age combined with work place retaliation that wouldn't permit me time off as a new, mid age employee, to get corrective surgery. many of the corporations where i wb whistleblew (one employer) & that pushed me out of work, donate to united way & these non-profits. some of these non-profits are shady. all businesses exist to make money. üí∞üí∞ unlike private pay, these places don't care if they help you or not. most can't help. they serve as places to vent. "you get what you pay for." the m.d. strongly suggested that i leave the area because i was in the south, in a lower demographic, from where i was raised. the jobs & the area were an obvious cultural mismatch. i was encouraged to just pick up & get employment and return to the expensive n.e. i agreed. it does cost money to move. i needed a job, moving money, and a place to live. to rent, i needed employment. i never lived with random strangers selected from the internet. i always had my own place. when i moved south, i had a job lined up and an apt with a commercial company that was well funded, safe & maintained. my own lock, key & lease. i couldn't get work up north. i gave up my residence when i moved south. i needed a job to qualify for a place to live. i did an extensive search both in & out of my career field. my circumstances are complex. i am financially literate. low wage jobs cant hire me. temp agencies cant hire me. its not that its beneath me. i would need someone to show me how i can survive and meet the basic necessities to live, while making an extremely low amount of money. i am #'s oriented & adhere to a budget. many places of employment said i am overqualified. they didn't want to waste their time hiring a short term employee who would still be looking. how do i know this? i tried. the survival jobs were low wage, low skilled & when they discovered i was still looking, the micromanagemt & nitpicking to get me to quit began to surface. i wouldnt quit. they had to push me out. i've worked in prof'l co roles to understand human resources, labor laws, management, healthcare costs, cultural fit & employer liability concerns. co's do push out older people and they dont have to hire them either. in the recent jobs i had, the pay was inadequate & did not meet my financial needs. i developed age related health issues & i couldn't afford housing & healthcare on the very low pay. i have to earn a living wage. the govt can't take care of me. the govt programs provide subsistence level care that is inadequate. it doesnt meet everyone's needs. most therapy isnt even on the same cognitive level for someone with advanced education, self awareness & who had prior advanced therapy. i was raised upper-middle class where i had the best education and medical & dental care. i studied masters level psychology with my masters academic degree program. i saw private pay out of pocket phd & m.d. therapists. what kept me functioning was a healthy lifestyle combined with housing, healthcare, gym, yoga, dental & vision care & proper nutrition which costs money. poverty living is hard on anyone. men and women are not biologically equal. younger people are not biologically equal to older people. i've aged out of corporate jobs. corporate jobs have been dumbed down due to automation. the wages have been stagnant, 401k & pensions phased out with high turnover, out sourcing, & lack of loyalty. its not that i dont want to work, i can't get work. from my pushouts & lawsuits, the places need to be a cultural fit and pay a living wage. my bills and obligations are not yours. some people walk away from bills and they want others to do what they do. ignoring bills, lying on resumes, shacking up with strangers isnt something that works for me. i dont know how to dumb down & function at a robotic sublevel. i tried. and the employers could see i was out of my element. like what was i doing there? what happened to get reduced to such a low level of existence? i dont criticize others for their choices. what i needed to stay alive, thriving & healthy is out of reach for me. at my age, there's 15 yrs max left to work. ss minus medicare & grad student loan will keep me where i am now. and this is why i have reality based (non mentally ill) thoughts & a need to "s." üòï	1
guys, if you ever need anyone to talk to, i'm here, and you're never alone. life really isn't easy and maybe we'll all going through the same or similar situation, where you feel like there's no reason to wake up in the morning anywhere. if you ever feel like you need someone to talk with, i'm here. and perhaps by motivating one another, we can all win this battle together. hope you're all having a wonderful wednesday, and if you're having a bad day, then hope tomorrow will be 200% better than today! love you all ‚ù§Ô∏è!	1

glad i made ithey guys. wanted to share this, incase it helps anyone. in november of 2015, i attempted suicide. it didn't work. not even close. i thought it would, and i was totally prepared to die. when it didn't, i felt a mixture of disappointment and relief. cut to: last october 2016. i was better, definitely better, but no where near close to being healed. i was depressed most weeks, and i often thought about suicide. this lasted up until around the beginning of january. until then, i was still healing, and still trying to just get through life. cut to: march 2017. i'd been feeling so much better. i was enjoying life, and for the first time in ages, i was enjoying getting out and going to class, and even seeing people. that's why i didn't see that tuesday coming. out of no where, the feelings hit me, and it was as if they'd never left. i was on campus, looking at everyone around me, feeling completely alone and completely done. i was determined to try again, only this time i wouldn't mess up. only this time, my boyfriend saved me. he talked me through it, helped me through the night, and by the next morning i was on my way to feeling better again. you know how these things go. finally, cut to: the end of march. i decided to begin applying for jobs (i graduate college in may.) i applied, and got denied, to many many places. i was beginning to get distraught, and i felt hopeless. at this point, i didn't know why i was alive. it felt like i had nothing going for me, and i was doomed to be worthless. (this process for me technically started in january, but i focused a lot on it in march.) a week later a saw a job posting for a position that looked like it would fit me. not thinking anything of it, or expecting a reply, i sent in my application. the next day i got an interview. that same day i was hired. since then, it's only april. today is april 22nd, 2017, and i am so thankful i was never successful in ending my life. this job that i thought nothing of, has changed my life. it is the job of my dreams. each day i walk in to work so excited, and so so incredibly happy. after my first day, the first thing i thought to myself was "thank god i lived." things can change. things can turn around. i'm not saying i still don't struggle, or that i won't ever struggle again. hell most nights are still hard, haha. but because i made it through, i got to experience this incredible opportunity to work for my dream company, doing what i love to do. it only took 2 days for things to get dramatically better. 2 days. it's unfortunate i suffered for so long, and that most people have to, but i just wanted to tell someone my story in case anyone else feels trapped in how their life is going. i think i'll always struggle, but at least now i'm happy most days. if anyone needs someone to talk to, i'm here üòä	1

found [28m] my fiance[27f] posts in a woman's forum, i found out she much preferred sex with her friends with benefits and comments on pictures of naked guys been with my fiance for 2 years i proposed to her on thanksgiving. we aren't living together but plan to after getting married. now before people get mad at me for snooping, my girlfriend has read all of my reddit account posts and even my fb messenger history. so yes, i have seen my girlfriend use this website time to time. when i got home i checked to see if she used her same username for the site and i saw her posts. i was skimming over it and i saw she commented on pictures of naked guys and most of the time they didn't even have their faces on em. one thing though is that it wasn't guys posting photos just women sharing them. now i'll be honest this made me really uncomfortable because reading those comments one she kept talking about how she wanted to suck these guys and give bjs. in our relationship she rarely gives me a bj. and in general she was a lot more sexual in these comments than she ever is with me. i just never seen that side of her, when she does get sexual it's more like a thanks to me. two all of these guys were a lot bigger than me. i am closer to average. after i saw that i already felt pretty bad but now i kept reading. and then i find three huge posts and time to time comments referencing her ex and me. there is one asking on how to find a girl for a threesome and if the girl should be prettier than her or less attractive. she doesn't say it's the ex but based on the time line i am pretty sure it is. also she has never at all expressed interest in doing a threesome with me with another girl üôÉ there is one about how to get a guy that is terrified of emotional commitment to settle down. she says that he is super attractive and can have any girl he wants. read the post and she basically talks about how despite all the stuff she has done for him he still isn't ready to settle down. then a later post saying he was full of shit that he was just using her but she still loved him. and then there was one with me written 280 days ago saying that she feels blessed that she found me in life. she says that i keep her at an emotionally stable place. she says that her ex wouldn't have made a good boyfriend because he is too much of a womanizer and that dating men that have that many women chasing them is only fun for short term relationships. but she says that she really misses the sex. she says in comments that i make her orgasm some of the times but it's not the same. i don't know what the hell to do. i have dedicated my life to this girl. i spent about a 1k just for valentine's day. only to find that she is only luke warm into me. i can't imagine these thoughts and these feelings ever leaving my head. yet at the same time i have planned out my life with her. also things that didn't bother me in particular now really strings. for example i used to think oh my girlfriend doesn't like giving blow jobs now i realize she doesn't like giving me blow jobs. i don't know guys i'm fucking destroyed. she has said this in the past and her posts show it too that of the guys she has been with i treat her the best, yet she cares about me the least. i don't know. i feel hurt and broken. i understand lots of people are gonna say but she is with you now! and that's all that matters. but i feel like the community college she is going to after being rejected by all of the schools she wanted to go to. i don't know if i'm making too much of it. if i should ignore those words because they are a private forum and i don't know the emotional state she was in. i want to hear what she has to say but i have no idea if she can say anything that will ever make this whole situation okay. **tl;dr- i found out from my fiance's posts on a forum that she much preferred sex with her friends with benefits. i also found out she comments on pictures of naked guys. i am thinking of breaking up.**	0
i'm interested in a girl, she seems interested in me, but she's in a relationship that she's expressed displeasure about. what do? i (m25) recently met a girl (24) who climbs at the same climbing gym as me and i think we've really hit it off (i say "i think" because i was diagnosed with mild asperger's a year and a half ago which was a broadside hit to my confidence in my ability to read body language and social cues). we've climbed 1-3 times a week for about 4 weeks now, and as soon as we met i knew i had major feelings for her. after the second time we climbed i found out through conversation that she has a boyfriend. so i took the l and started the process of moving on. we continued to meet up to climb and as we did so, it kept resetting the process: we'd climb, i'd get major feelings, we wouldn't climb for a couple days, i'd feel like i had moved on, we'd climb again, repeat. part of the reason it resets is because every time we climb, i'm picking up on a vibe of extreme interest on her part: giving each other light shit if we bail on a climb or otherwise screw up, making a joke while the other is climbing that makes the other have to bail because they're laughing, jokingly pushing me or tapping my shoulder to emphasize a point, offering to adjust my harness without me asking just because i said it was being a pain in the ass. this past weekend she asked me to take pictures for social media as she climbed, i sat down in a chair to review them with her and she stood behind me and leaned on my shoulder as she was reviewing them. the reason i doubt these signals is because texting has pretty dry and basically just used to plan climbing days (although one time after i told her i'd be gone for a few days on vacation she said "how am i supposed to climb without my partner üò¢"). i know that some people are just naturally flirty and don't want to read into something any meaning that isn't there, but i also don't want to be missing blindingly obvious signals. about a week and half ago, it came out that she's not happy with her relationship (growing stale, doesn't feel special, etc.). i expressed sympathy for the situation and related it to a recent long term relationship of mine that had ended. i didn't pry so as not to come across as eager about this situation. we talked about it briefly, and then continued to climb. this past weekend, we met up again and i asked her "how's life?" and she said "it sucks." i asked why and she said "considering breaking up with my boyfriend." we then talked for about 5-10 minutes about the situation as she opened up about it (part of this included her saying she didn't really care if the relationship ended). note that this is the same day that she adjusted my harness of her own accord and leaned on my shoulder to review the pics. now we come to what i need advice on: i feel like i've been in a whirlwind for the past month and i just want it to stop. i want clarity on the situation and don't know if i should ask tell her about the vibes i've been picking up on and ask if there's anything there. but i'm willing to endure the whirlwind and sit on this feeling if it's my best chance at making something happen with her down the line. my dilemma is this: ask what's up and risk losing a friend and climbing buddy because of residual awkwardness after the fact, or wait and see what happens and possibly miss the train. the last thing i want to do is interfere in a relationship, but this feeling is getting to be a lot to handle. so i repeat my question from the title: what do?	0

drinking pee my fiance and i went to the beach to enjoy the beautiful weather. we tried multiple beach access spots but everywhere was packed so there was no parking at any of them and tons of cars waiting for spots. after waiting for about 30 min with 4 whining kids in the car he told me to take them to the beach and he'd wait for a spot. 2 of the kids wanted to stay in the car with him so i took the other two. shortly after we find a spot and set up he calls me and tells me one of the little ones wants to come on the beach now. i walk to the car and am waiting for him to get his shoes on and grab my chick fil a cup i had left in my cup holder. i get a big mouth full and realize it is really warm and tastes funny so i spit it out and turn around to my fiance and the look of horror on his face says it all. he quickly hands me a bottle of water and then starts laughing hysterically. i blurt out "did i just drink someone's pee?!" he can't stop laughing and saying sorry. im repeatedly swooshing water and spitting it out. once he stops laughing he finally tells me that one of the boys had to pee so he dumped my drink and convinced him to pee in the cup. he put the lid on it and the 5 year old even told him he should throw it away but he assured him that no one would drink it and he'd toss it once they got out. üòë i made smart ass jokes about it for hours but in all serious i might never drink cherry dr pepper again. my first time posting on reddit. don't want to tell anyone who actually knows me üòÇ tl;dr my fiance made our 5 year old pee in my cup so that he wouldn't lose his place in line and i drank it upon returning to the car.	0
i can't anymorei literally can't even talk to people casually. everytime i try i just want to disappear. i just can't amount to anything. everyone around me has got a memo that i seemed to miss. everyone has got it. not me and it's fucking disgraceful. i don't deserve love or any other good things adjacent to that. everyone else had already done the things i'm just starting to discover because i spent my teenage years fucking depressed. how fucking pathetic is that huh ? i just wish i could fucking die already, but i'm even too much of a coward to do that. god fucking damn. why the fuck can't i man up for once in my pathetic life and do something right. i could go on and on but im not gonna burden you all. bye üëã	1

i do not like america that much tbh i don't like their accent and like how they talk that much. they kind of sound a weird and awkward. i like some of their slang but some of it is not good like chile üá®üá± and dude. i like some of the slang their rappers use a lot tho so that's good. also i don't know why they don't like sports that much, like in my school nearly every boy plays like football or rugby or whatever and like 40% of the girls. i think it's cause they don't have good access to sporting facilities and stuff like that or it's just some areas but idk. also i don't like the 2 party system that much.	0

petty reasons for seeking attention outside of my (21f) relationship... warning: you're about to read smth extremely stupid. so my boyfriend (26) and i have been going out for about 3 months now, all is well, all is good. or i thought. he's going through a rough patch this period and although i've been trying to support him, a couple of weeks ago we got into an argument. he felt i was distant and uninterested, like he was always supposed to entertain me and wanted to end it. i was really drunk when he told me. i started ugly crying, we argued a little, in my drunkness i went out clubbing alone - god knows whatever i did. horrible. it was pretty dramatic but we sorted it out. his birthday is coming up in a few days and i planned some activities for us he told me he'd wished for a time to do, bought him a birthday gift and was thinking of baking him a cake. now i feel like i did too much... we haven't seen each other in a week, which is not a big deal, but i'm kind of disappointed in him not proposing something. i also feel like i'm latching onto the conversation and he's seeing my messages, but not responding. i think that after the quasi fight we had i'm unsure of the whole situation and especially his feelings towards me. i'm starting to believe i should quit. it's also worth mentioning that i always was the one who dumped the other one so this is was a huge shock for me, causing me now to be a lil insecure. he always commented on me responding to guys hitting on me. i'm flirtatious by nature and even then, was only making fun of the situation. so as a consequence of me feeling left out and being the petty bitch i am i started to respond to messages guys sent me again, thus gaining the attention i longed for. i don't condone my behaviour in any way. i'm not getting attention for a couple of days and i'm already knocking on other doors. it's not healthy. i'm really upset, i mean i'm nervous - he's completely ignoring me and i'm not gonna double text him all the time. goodbye. this other guy invited me to a date tonight - i initially wanted to accept, although kindly declined, thinking of the man who just last week confessed his feelings for me. but he's not showing them, i'm sad and other boys are waiting for a shot with me (i only wany one tho üò©üò≠) i don't know if i should end our short relationship or wait for him. wasting my time or his is not something i wish for. maybe if our little argument did not happen, i wouldn't be feeling this way. tldr: bf and i got into a fight, almost broke up, now i feel insecure and like he's ignoring me and acting single again like a dumb ho. i need some sense beaten into me.	0

how is it possible to move forward while i hate myself ish? everything i'm told is contradicting everything i have ever experienced/thought incoming long post. i just need to get this out of my head, feel free to chime in (please? üò≠ idfk i just need someone to tell me their opinion on this) okay so this is going to sound like trolling but trust me it isn't. (every time i post something even close to this people always thing i'm trolling -.-) i've had a tough childhood. i'm sure that affects this in a huge way. i have lived with depression and social anxiety for 11-14 years. something very traumatic happened to me when i was in 3rd grade. ever since that day i wasn't the same person. when i was little i was outgoing, fun, just so full of energy. i freakin loved playing pranks on my classmates lmao. i was the class clown and it often got me in trouble. after this event happened i just wanted to be in bed all day long. i stopped caring about anything and everything. everyone noticed but no one bothered to do anything about it. those people who were supposed to protect me stood there and watched this go on and ignored it. i shut down emotionally, physically, and mentally for several years. (until 8th grade) when i tried to come out of my zombie state i couldn't lol.. i found out i had developed selective mutism. i literally didn't talk to anyone at all. i was isolated from society for so many years. now here's where my problem comes in. throughout all of this, like i mentioned, i shut down. i really mean it. i didn't shower for weeks at times. no deodorant, didn't brush my teeth. i didn't take care of myself in general. i didn't care about anything. what i'm trying to say is, i see myself as really unattractive. over time, i managed to not see myself as unattractive. in my opinion, i'm average.. not ugly not attractive. there's just one problem with that though. people constantly tell me otherwise. let's get one thing clear before i continue. i have never been one of those people that does around telling everyone how "i'm shit, i'm no good at anything, i'm so fucking ugly, i wish i were just dead, i'm a burden" so it's not like people are telling me "oh no you're not ugly you're hot" because i say i'm ugly. no. i really mean it when i say i haven't spoken a word in years. my confidence level is nonexistent. i have been told my actions don't back up the no confidence thing though. i regularly (in winter) wear leather jackets, i wear slim fit jeans, motorcycle, stand up straight, etc stuff like that. anyway, so i regularly get compliments on my appearance. they're not like subtle compliments though. on one occasion i was walking up the stairs on my college building and this girl and i almost ran into each other. she looked up and said "sorr" and before she could finish saying it "ohhhhh or not.. , damn you're hot!" on multiple other occasions i have also been told similar things. when i go to the gym i often find people staring at me. i'm so puzzled by what the fuck they're seeing or idfk because i'm like what the fuck? (i'm not talking about occasional glancing. i'm taking about the creepy old guy type of staring) i'm no where near that attractive. there's a ton of more attractive people here wtf u looking here for? a few hours ago today someone came up to me and "you're hella hot" um? thanks? i honestly do not feel anywhere near this attractive. like i mentioned, i'm average (to me) i honestly don't meet my own definition of attractive lol.. let's make a list of everything unattractive with me. - for most of my life i've had "man boobs" i still do somewhat have them but not as visible as before - my skin is shit - i have depression (who the fuck has time to look like a zombie all day?) - i have those lines under my eyes - my lips are too big, in my opinion - i have a ton of medical conditions i have a lot more but those are the most prominent ones i guess. honestly, when i'm in the bathroom i can't even look at myself in the mirror. idk.. it's like people have too low standards compared to mine. by the way, like these standards i have are only for myself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk how that works.	0

i (24f) feel like i'm failing at being an adult. got married to my now husband (27m) and can't adjust to the new way of life. panicking :( my entire life was a little different from anyone else i knew. i was very sheltered and got an insanely late start in life. and also, i lived at home with my dad literally until now. it's pathetic. ive lived with my dad and four younger siblings. someone was always, always around and i was used to it, and it was comforting. that's what ive been used to. now, i got married and i am literally panicking. i feel like i'm a huge failure. we moved into an apartment together, and our schedules haven't changed from what they were before. we both have the same jobs, same hours, etc. i get home 4 hours before he does.. and it's proving to be a huge shock for me. we've been married 6 days, and i come home and cry immediately and panic and can't seem to figure out how to deal with it. i don't want to ruin my marriage because i'm acting like a huge baby. i want to be normal and be like every other married couple that live together, just them. i need advice pls :( i know i sound like an immature kid, and it's exactly how i feel. i feel like i'm a huge failure as an adult and especially as a wife already üò≠ tl;dr; the shock of marriage and moving out has me in a panic everyday. i feel like a failure and don't know how to fix this.	0

i dont think ill ever be happy again. ever.i have absolutely no will to live anymore and i don't even know why i'm holding on still. like i genuinely don't want to be here anymore and somehow i'm okay with it. i don't want to do life or anything like that. i'm sick of everything and everyone and how i sad i am about literally the dumbest shit. i have no will to continue and i think it's time to just end it. i've always wondered when i'd reach that point where i actually didn't want to live anymore and i think i'm there. i don't want to exist pathetically anymore like i'm really tired of it. i've been waiting for things to get better since as long as i can remember and it never has. it's only gotten worse. nothing means anything to me anymore. i'm actually really happy that i have no will to live anymore because now i can end it without hesitation. anyways. i don't know why i'm posting here... lol. deuces ‚úåÔ∏è	1
i can't take it anymore (15f)i can't take it anymore but can't end it either. not that i'm scared of death. i'm scared that i'll fail. my parents (mostly my mom cuz my dad rearly sees me) abuse me mentally, at least i think so. maybe i'm just a fucking angsty teen who's ungrateful towards her parents but either way it fucking hurts. bcuz my mom has a chronic illness she makes me and my twin brother chores. i mean it's not that big of a deal but like i have 9 classes everyday for 5 days +extra classes. i need some break too. my twin brother has better grades than me and the "equality" my parents gives us makes my heart flutter ‚ò∫Ô∏è/sarcasm. not long ago a mail sent to my mom about how i didn't attended a class and didn't done my homework which i did but turned in late and i even attended my class. and after online classes ended my mom slammed my door open and yelled at me "what the hell are you think you're doing? why didn't you attend your class and didn't done your homework!? " and i was panicking while trying to stay stable. after my mom slammedy door again to my face saying "think about what you have done i'm gonna talk with your father when he gets home" and after she closed my door i had a panic attack and thought "i should end it all rn" so i texted my friends that i can't take it anymore and stuff but in the end didn't do it. but when my mom gets an e mail that says your son did done his 4 or more (not sure) homeworks she didn't even get mad ahh yes ik i'm just the useless dumb one but you didn't bad to smear it to my face. my mom gets angry at everything i'm sure that she tries to find things to get mad over so she can yell at me. maybe like i said i'm just an ungrateful little bitch and my parents are right. if my parents are really good people then my death will be like a holiday for them no angsty teen with her nagging, no extra spending money, no extra work. either way my death would be better for everyone i know. i'm not even sure that my friends even still like me. i just annoy them but cuz i'm just a pitiful person they can't say that to my face. i also showing some symptoms of ptsd but cuz my parents won't let me to see a psychiatrist i don't know. i can't take doing the same things for everyday tame online classes, fantasize about death sleep, repeat. i can't afford to get stressed about school every single day. and i can't even understand anything. the feeling of numbness us worse than being suicidal. the void just grows and it's just the worst not being able to feel and having a void inside you. i've been cutting for a while and my plan is to go to the bathroom to take a shower and slit my wrists open in the bathtub but if i fail that'll make everything worse so if you have effective ways to do so please tell me i can't do this anymore. and please don't tell me it gets better or don't do it i never thought that i'll live past 20.	1
i m(26) don't know if i have started developing more and more feelings for this girl i'm dating f(24) or is it just i want what i can't have? been dating this girl for a couple of weeks and i really am beginning to like her. she's not the type i go for either. i usually always go for the blonde bimbo type girl with nothing much about her, no idea why!? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è anyway the dates have been going well and she's showing signs that she's interested in me. for example it caught me by surprise when we met up and i said hi and what not but she just stood there with her head up pouting looking for a kiss. i was pleasantly surprised, kind of felt like a girlfriend for a second which i have missed. anyway she went really quiet with me after a couple of dates so i asked her what's wrong and she said she's not sure if she's ready to jump in and carry on dating. i instantly thought she's letting me down easy, i had that gut feeling. we speak again recently after a few days of no contact and she said that she was comparing me to her me ex which shows she's not ready to continue dating with people. i agree 100% that's defiantly a sign she's not ready but i'm not sure if she's just letting me down easy and she's just giving me an excuse. she's split up with him about 3/4 months ago which is still fairly fresh imo. she's knows i'd happily rather be told bluntly, makes it easier. so i go back into my tinder account and notice she's still actually on it, which is fine. we're not exclusive or anything. she can do what she wants. not sure if she's using it currently but she has the same profile when we started talking because our conversation is still there. point being is i think i really do like her, i was gutted when she said she wanted to stop dating. i don't love her or anything that serious but i'm finding it hard to distinguish either really liking someone and wanting to date them or having something i know i can't have? is there a way to tell between these feelings. it's literally all i have been thinking about the last few days. it's actually affected my appetite, don't really feel that hungry when i think about it as sad as it sounds. tl;dr don't know if i have genuine feelings developing for this girl or is it one of those things where it's something i can't have so i want it more? even though i think we could still date in the future.	0
unemployment and emotional numbness tl;dr i can't find a job post-graduation, and it's tricking me into thinking my wonderful relationship has something wrong with it because the love is buried under stress right now. i'm (f 21) a recent college graduate (may 18) down on my luck for finding work, and in the past week or two, it's become more and more affective to my self esteem and my hopes to find a job i really love. things are really hard at home because my parents simply think i'm not trying hard enough, even though i've applied to 70+ positions since october 2018. the stress has numbed every single one of my emotions in the past week or two, most unfortunately the incredible affection i typically feel toward my boyfriend (21). he is wonderful to me in every way, and no aspect of our relationship has changed otherwise. but i just feel this weird unexplainable distance from him and from my normal self too. it's probably/definitely irrational but now on top of the employment problem, there's a nagging worry that my relationship is somehow in jeopardy even though just a week ago, and for the whole other entirety of our time together, i knew he was the one, and we still plan to be married. i'm trying to remind myself that i *must* still love him just the same as always and care for him if i'm so worried about this. i feel like the stress is playing mind games with me, but everything is so hard to make sense of right now and i'm probably not in the right mind to make the correct sense of it anyhow. has anyone dealt with anything like this? is it normal? i'm still young and totally new to fully-adult relationships (i.e. not in school anymore) so i feel like i'm still learning how to navigate these things in a way that is mature and not shortsighted. will gladly accept any and all replies ‚ù§Ô∏è	0

another person in this big world hey, i'm new to sw, tbh i didn't know it existed till 5 mins ago, i just wanted to share a little bit of who i am, i am a 20 year old from england who has struggled with depression for about 7 years, i have had suicidal thoughts and self harmed for about 4 years, i have had countless different attempts and have tried to leave this planet in so many different ways, but i'm here still. in fact. i'm better off than i was 6 months ago and i'm not gonna say "it gets better" because that would be bullshit if i said it, you're gonna have ups and downs, you're gonna have days where your life feels bearable and days where you want to hurl yourself off of a bridge but what i'm trying to say is, i never planned to stay past my 18th birthday and here i am at 20, grinding away and trying to prove myself and everyone else wrong, making a life for myself that i'm happy to live. if you ever need to talk, you can pm me, or reply to this post, stay strong and i hope you live long enough to see yourself happier. deuces ‚úåüèΩ	1

i (23 f) don't understand my "friend" (25 m) this is my first time posting on reddit, so here we go. i first met my friend when he and his (now also my friend) were visiting from out of state. i was coming back into town after a trip. for further context we had met through tinder. we started texting, a lot, and that soon turned into him inviting me to play games with him and his friend (again, now my friend). this went on for quite a while. constant communication and not to mention compliments. it felt super flirty. i very much started to develop a crush on him. there was one point, however, he just kind of backed off. his replies were short, the way he was talking changed, just things i noticed very easily through text. i got very confused and disappointed. i never said much about it though other than at one point i had asked if we were just friends. he said something along the lines of "üëÄ yeah, i thought thats what we were doing, why?" after that time, we didn't talk for a while. couple of weeks (probably a month or two actually). then one day i decided to get a tattoo. i had posted about it on my snapchat and thats when he started talking to me again and because of it we ended up planning on finally meeting. he lives in the state right below mine and going there is only about 1.5hour drive. so i did. that next week i drove down there and met the both of them for the first time. that was the start of the summer. after that point we were back to talking again constantly. the way which we talked was very cheesy cute and it was much more obvious than before that it was flirty. we started facetiming all the time. he would get off work and immediately ask me what i was doing and i would be waiting and expecting him. i went to see him a couple more times. i would stay over too. we never did anything beyond just hanging out and then going to sleep & cuddling. he came up to see me as well so it wasnt like i was the only one going out of my way. but then it got to the end of summer. i went to see him on the 3rd of july to stay and do something on the 4th. let me just say it was a mess. i got pretty drunk on the 4th and was kind of a mess. during that he kind of distanced himself and was hanging out with other people we had gotten together with. i was left with our friend since he was the only other person i knew. when we were going back home he asked if i was ok and i told him i was disappointed he was nowhere to be found. he admitted to me that he hadnt expected me to get drunk and wasnt prepared to babysit me. i was so embarrassed but we got home and i stayed and we just did our usual cuddle and then slept. i went home the next day and again i noticed how he was talking to me and the frequency changed. very short, no initiation, just completely off. i panicked and was afraid i had just been a complete ass and scared him off. thats when i confided in our friend and he admitted to me that he had told him he had hooked up with an ex he had three years of history with. (this was two days after the 4th). i was devastated. our friend had also told me that while we were all together he had noticed him talking to other girls still (which could have been friends but i kind of doubt at this point for the most part). i had the worst 2 months after that. he and i didnt ever address it. we barely spoke at all. and then eventually i saw they were back together from an instagram post. i just was so done. i even went and got a tattoo to remind myself not to keep allowing myself to rely on other people for happiness. i honestly felt so void. the whole thing really fucked up my emotions. but to no surprise, in some time he out of nowhere drunk texted me and from there until about two weeks ago we kind of got close again. i've been very guarded this time and didn't let myself sink in too far but i won't deny i still had and have a soft spot for him. in that time i had also finally opened up and told him how i knew about everything about the hook up and that it hurt me because i liked him and thought he felt the same. he admitted to fucking it up. things kind of went back to us talking consistently and being flirty, but after a month again i noticed a change again. so i brought it up and he told me that he was thinking about it and that the distance sucked and he really values my friendship & he would hate for something to happen between us that would ruin it forever. we were just finally open about real shit and feelings and it was good. but now we're just back at the point where we aren't really talking at all. i know friends don't have to talk all the time, but just the feeling of going 0-100 is too much for me and i dont understand. like sometimes i really don't know if he values our friendship like he says. he's very hard to read and doesn't usually open up unless prompted. idk i more or less just maybe want some input on this i guess since i have never been able to understand. congrats if you made it this far. tldr; guy i liked from another state is slightly problematic and i can't read him or his intentions.	0

i think i just crushed my boyfriends confidence and i think i made him thinks everyone hates him a little bit of backstory: met my bf last year through school, he was in most of my classes, we started talking, we clicked and he asked me out. we've been been together for almost 6 months, and we are very close, he's 15, i'm f15, and everything is great with him, not perfect but i'll say pretty great for a highschool relationship. but theres this one thing..... my boyfriend gets a lot of shit, and he's pretty sensitive and takes things pretty hard and he will beat himself up if hes pisses off people. he just doesn't want to annoy anyone or start shit, i knew he was getting shit, asked about it and he says he doesn't care what other people think. but a part of me knew for months that did care what people think, but i never brought it up. but one day last year, when he was away, a good half of my class started talking shit about him, just saying shit how he's stupid/thick as, how he tries to act cool and follows people around,and how he's acts weird, laughs at random things, which is pretty much all bs, and i've had people ask why him? or that i could do better, or that i'm too smart for him, and the "you are seriously still with him?" or "your pretty fucking stupid for dating him" ouch that stung. but i haven't told him the stuff i heard about him ik that will hurt him a bit. but i think he's great, he's always there for me, knows if there's something off with me, makes sure i'm happy and there's a different side or him that only i see like he's so sweet and sensitive and caring and true colours never shine at school. and people talk shit about him without knowing him and thats life i guess, but they need to leave him alone. :/ but today of all days i told him all that shit that's been said to me/ i heard about, we were both shitty, he had a crap day and i just started my period so i was moody af and pretty shitty, i was texting him telling him about how one of my friends was saying that she doesn't like him and how i'm sick of her being a fucking bitch to you when he tries to be nice to her, he said said man people don't like me and i'm used to it by now, and we kept talking and i said i need new friends and he said yeah you do, told him that's its hard for me to make friends cause i'm weird and people think i'm stupid for dating you, he was like well people do really hate me, and my dumb ass carried on saying all the other shit i've heard about him but i said that shit isn't true , he said well im depressed now, fuck them, they don't even know me etc, and was like why me, why is it always fucking me, like they hate other people for certain reasons, but as soon as i started highschool everyone hated me for no reason, asked if he was ok, said no im not ok, god just kill me, said he hates everything, says he's tried for years to make good friends but no one wants him, says he is past getting better, says school is a nightmare, that i'm the only that doesn't hate me, says all of his school years were bad till he meet me, says he wants to fucking leave. i got so scared, had a panic attack, broke down crying while he was saying all that stuff, and felt so much guilt cause i just should of kept my mouth shut and now i'm so scared i've pushed my bf and i think because of me i've made him think that everyone hates and the guilt is killing me if i just kept my mouth shut i he wouldn't think everyone hates him and everything would be ok if i just kept my mouth shut i really fucked this one up üò≠ tl:dr told my sensitive bf (m15) about shit that people have said about him, took it really badly and now he think everyone hates him, said we wants to leave and just hates everything rn and says he tries to make good friends but they never like him, i (f15) freaked out, had a panic attack and feel really bad because if i kept my mouth shut he wouldn't feel so low üòî	0

i'm done after my grandfather dies.i literally have nothing to live for. taking care of him is my only purpose right now and when he dies, i'm done, too. i'm tired of how my aunt talks to me and expects me to take care of her, too. i have no kids yet at 28 i'm essentially taking care of two grown adults. he's legitimately bedridden, she's just fat and lazy. i've been on r/justnofamily before. things won't change fast enough before he dies so i'm just holding on. i have no place of my own or savings. my so believes "love is a vibe" with a switch so i am wasting my emotion and energy there. i dropped out of college because i'm a dumb ass. i gave up a free ride because i wanted to "get away" when i was young. i don't have a career and am currently unemployed playing caretaker. i have no hobbies, skills, or talents. i'm in medical, credit card, and student loan debt. there's a good chance i'm infertile. i have ms. all i want to do anymore is just sleep and eat and go through the motions of the days. i have nothing to offer this world, i am a drain of resources. i was an unplanned baby. mom had me at 39. if she wasn't catholic i may have been aborted and this whole thing avoided. i'm not really even supposed to be on this planet, sucking everyone else's oxygen and my fat ass eating everyone's food. i have nothing to offer an so, i really don't. i'm good as a body and throat to fuck but i have nothing to offer. nothing makes me special or wonderful. without a job, i'm essentially a leech. i'm surprised he's putting up with me (and living in a basement at 28!) but, since love is a switch, there's no guarantee he'll stick around. and i have nothing to offer future suitors except a pussy and a mouth. so, i'm stuck in debt with no career and i can't get a career until i finish school and i can't finish school until i pay off my loans and i can't pay off my loans until i get a career... see where i'm going with this? past me fucked up so much that there's nothing left for present me. once grandpa's dead, i'm not holding on for my aunt or anyone else. call suicide selfish, go ahead, but it's also shittier to keep living because it's what everyone else wants. it's shitty for me to have to keep living because you'd be heartbroken and have to deal with my loss after i died. i think it's the ultimate control to guilt someone into living. once i'm dead, it won't matter. i won't care about your feelings. i don't know how, although oding on insulin seems to be the least messy and most convenient way. if this post gets deleted then there's just more fuel to my fire. üëç	1

while rehabbing a paid of my favorite shoes i've got a brown pair of leather desert boots that are my absolute favorite. they were cheap, but they've held up incredibly well, and they're extremely comfortable. seeing as they were cheap, the adhesive holding the solon started to loosen and the soul started pulling away from the bottom of the shoe. well, i ordered some shoe goo off of amazon and spent the last three days gluing and clamping and regluing andre clamping and straightening and gluing some more, be very careful to get them just right. after letting the adhesive cure, i was very satisfied with the results, however the leather was a bit stressed from all of my efforts, so i inserted some shoe forms into the shoe, soak the leather nice and well, and put them into my oven on the lowest temperature possible to try and reform the leather. i fucked up and not realizing that this low heat would melt the adhesive holding the shoe together, and when i pulled them out of the oven after 20 minutes the entire sole of the shoe peeled off the bottom and fell on the floor, ruining three days worth of work üò© oh well. guess i'll set about regluing them and reclamping them all over again üôÑhopefully the adhesive will hold! i learned my relesson this time. keep your shoes out of the oven! tl;dr: spent 3 days repairing my shoes only to sabotage my own efforts by melting the sole off on the oven.	0
my birthday was yesterday and only acquaintances from years ago remembered i got a notification from facebook last december saying that no friends wished me a happy birthday last year. didn't think much of it since i had a great time celebrating it with my family and i wasn't that close with my course batchmates yet. i was a little disappointed that my friends of 7 years forgot though. i always celebrated their birthdays with them after all. yesterday, i was surprised that an old friend group (that i haven't interacted properly in months) greeted me. not a single greeting came from my friends of 7 years and my newly befriended batchmates whom i had gotten really close to. it was weird seeing how friends i've only known for a few months cared to remember than the friends i've been with for years. on a happier note, i celebrated my 20th with my boyfriend. he was more excited than i was: greeting me every minute and being super affectionate like a hyperactive puppy. i'd never had a happier birthday üéÇ	0

apparently i posted a vaguely suicidal rant on twitter shortly before attempting (and failing). i have no memory of this. the answer to the question is drugs. i was unbelievably drugged up in an attempt to make sure i wasn't sober enough to follow through with what i wanted to do. apparently i attempted with a bag because that's what i woke up with on my face. i still believe if i hadn't taken the drugs that i would've succeeded that night. i used to have a twitter account when i was in college almost a decade ago, and once i graduated i stopped using it. i started burning bridges with most people and started detaching as much as possible. well, i nuked the bridge with those tweets. i didn't know what was going on until i opened my phone and the twitter app was open. this immediately caught me off guard because i haven't had the app on my phone in years. first thing i see is just a screenshot of my suicidal rant on twitter with the caption "someone wants attention üòí" i don't really know how to describe the 17 tweets i posted, but it was so spiteful, hateful, self pitying, it was just unbelievable that i accidentally shared this awful side of me with hundreds of people. i quickly deleted the tweets and deactivated the account, but not before seeing people subtweeting about me and replying to the person who posted the screenshot. there was a rather large thread of people i haven't seen in years just saying i'm not serious, mocking me for how incoherent my tweets were, pulling out quotes and making fun of them, and taking digs at my mental state. there were even a few people who made veiled statements saying they wish i would kill myself. the 17 tweets themselves actually had zero interaction, not one like, not one comment, but there were at least 20 instances i saw of people posting screenshots and quotes. and that just means there are more out there who i don't follow or who are private/blocked. i expected going silent would've made people worried, but nope, nobody texted or called, nobody called the cops, nothing. and is it bad that it just made me feel worse that nobody actually reached out to see if i was okay? the last thing i wanted was attention, it wasn't a "suicidal gesture" like i saw people saying it was, but seeing nobody care except to be mean was really difficult. i'm glad no one called the cops, but seeing how people reacted just absolutely crushed me. seeing so many people callously talk about me and openly mock me was just awful. i don't plan on making any statements online or to anyone who followed the account. i can't believe this is real. i don't do drugs, i don't drink, i don't know what it's like to black out like this and not remember doing something. i'm not any more or less suicidal, i'm still just trying to commit to not dying before 2020. i can't tell you how much this affirms everything i've been feeling. i used to just think they all hated me. now i know.	1

just made an offer on a house! my boyfriend and i are buying a home!! we made an offer on one we love and are really hoping they accept it! we've been dating since we were 18 back in 2014, ended up having a daughter very soon after and our son was born two years later. we've had some major ups and downs in both our relationship and just financially and we're finally able to provide some stability and purchase a home! i am in tears. even if this offer falls through to know we're on our way to actually buying a home together is so relieving! i'm so proud and i have no one to share with üò≠üôèüèº	0
my procrastination will be the death of me i had an entire week to study for exams, and i only started on the day before. i have been awake for 35 hours and in the last 10 hours, my body 120pound has ingested 3 and a half caffeine pills. my brains fried, knees weak, arms are heavy. i even almost feel like vomiting on my sweater. i think i still passed my exams barely. in all seriousness, i never wanna feel like i do today. i don't why i do this to myself. üòû	0

does anyone have any good stories of when your trust was broken by a so and you were able to move past it? i (f26) recently went through a rough patch with my so(m25) where they were flirt texting with a mutual friend (f26) who's close in the friend circle and i caught them. they said some stuff through text, were going out behind my back and lying about where they were going, they sent some stuff on snapchat...little things that i guess could have been worse but still feels like they have broken my heart. i also feel betrayed by this "friend" who was flirting back with my so...i'm just all sorts of hurt üôÉ i can't get over feeling like this would have kept going if i hadn't caught them, and that they'll do it again if an opportunity presented itself. (this is a tl;dr version, i don't want to ramble on with the full version) i want to move past this and get over it, we have spoken about it and it seems like they are sorry and they love only me, but i'm also paranoid as fuck. i'm hoping someone has a good story of when something similar happened to you and were able to move past it. or honestly any story that will ease my heart and mind.	0

the end i wish i still had a reason to keep living. i've fucked out the last good thing. my girlfriend is going to break up with me and for good reason too. i'm hurting her and making her depressed. even her mom saw that. she was the one who said it. she was the only thing going right for me. and now she's gone. and today is our ten month anniversary. it's ironic. it's been like this for years. constant depression and suicidal thoughts. but things were actually getting better and i was happy. i was starting to see a reason to this. my scars had faded and i was ready to start again but it all went to shit. and i just wanted to say a final goodbye. i decided to end it all. i love you all. stay strong, i'll meet you on the other side. ‚ô•Ô∏è	1
answering a truth or dare... oof. this did happen today btw so, me and my friends were walking around at recess, chatting. all lots of fun and stuff. (middle school btw) so, 1 of my friends says, hey orange, truth or dare!!! i answer truth because everyone in my friend group knows my crush, but hadnt told her i like her yet. so he says, "ok then, if you had to have sex with someone at this school, who would it be?" so i obviously answer with my crush. i glance over and my crush is a good ways away, out of earshot luckily. immediately after answering, he sprints at flipping mach 173719387239482893392819048 over to my crush and says, "orange loves you and wants to **** you!!!!" and im likeüòµ i yell "no way no no no" so, now my crush knows i like them and thinks i want to do... something with her. we are both t w e l v e ooooooo o o o o o o o ffffff	0

have you seen target's new remodeled stores? what's your opinion on them? hello peeps! have you guys/gals seen target's new remodeled stores? if so, what's your opinion on the new look of the store? we have one where i live and it's been under renovations for a few months now. it's starting to look majorly different and i've been subscribed to r/target for a while so i've gotten to see the finished remodeled stores. (you could search on google for "remodeled target stores" if you haven't seen em) my opinion on the remodeling is that... it looks really nice and all (not to mention fancy af) but.. in my opinion, it's too fancy for the market target is in. target is more of a walmart type of store that sells everything from bathroom things all the way to food/vegetables. i feel like for a store to be this fancy it would probably make more sense to be kind of a fashion store such as clothes stores ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk just my opinion. really curious to see what people think about the remodeling, what's your opinion on all of this?	0

i've had a thing for my close friend for a year and it only seems to get stronger met him in university, we were living on the same floor in our dorm building and had similar classes because we were in the same program (but we never actually ever hungout in class - if we saw each other we'd smile but that's it) so we saw each other at the same time each day due to schedules just aligning. we always said hi, sometimes a little conversation here and there but always smiled or said hey. i loved it. he made me feel so at ease and comfortable. he is a little socially awkward but it's actually endearing. i feel like it's something that makes people like him so much if you get me. anyway long story short we just started becoming better friends during exam season last year (literally december 2019) and then got really close during the 2nd semester (started jan 2020) until the pandemic really hit and everyone was in lockdown mid-march. we stayed in touch of course, but spending lots of time with each other at the beginning of the year confirmed my feelings for him and i knew it was real because when i told our mutual friends about my crush, i started to like him even more. we have gotten closer with our 2nd year being online (sept 2020) and while we did talk in the summer, it was only a few times a month cause he was so busy working and all. when school started we would talk to each other at least 6 days a week. so we grew closer with each discord call (lmao) and stayed there for hours. we had periods where we didn't talk for like 20 minutes, but having that person on the other side was very comforting, i imagine for both of us.. as he literally told me that if we couldn't discord everyday he would kill himself lmao (online sciool had made us say things we never thought were in us. it's been shitty man). but omg i want him so much. i know we wouldn't actually work out long term because we have different core values and want different things at the end of the day, but right now i want him so bad. i know our friendship isn't worth sacrificing so i know it probably won't happen, but i can't ever stop imagining him holding me when i feel sad and upset or him doing other things to me. you know what i'm talking about. i know i want him because literally every time i get high, i think about how much i want him. and i've been getting high a lot recently because i'm on christmas break and this is something i need after the pain of those last 3 months. anyway... i just wanted to share that. would love to see anyone's thoughts or opinions on this, esp after i sober up üòÇ	0

i keep dreaming these life threatening nightmares for past couple of days. what does this mean ?ü§îü§îü§îü§î so the thing is i'm keep seeing scary nightmares. 1st : me jumping off the 4th floor. i jumped of the top floor of my school, and the moment before i was about to hit the ground i woke up with shock. 2nd : my house maid tried to kill me with kitchen knife. i don't know what happened to her i was just sitting in kitchen with mom and having coffee, she just grabbed the knife and charged at me. good thing is i threw the hot coffee on her face and i took that knife from her then i woke up. 3rd : road accident. me and my father arguing about something and then i saw a car was right coming at us, it just didn't moved a bit, the car just came right in front of us, i woke up before our car collide. 4th : train wreck. this one is scary, i just found out that my friend was stealing stuff from people who travels in my city's local train, i was mad at him and i was just trying to help him get out of there safely. we got off the train and walked just little bit away from it and two trains wrecked into each other	0

living situation with bf hey guys! my boyfriend and i have been at a crossroads lately. we love each other but aren't as close as we used to be. we are in the process of reconstructing a currently non habitable house to call home one day. my bf was living with me at my parents but didn't want to over stay his welcome and moved into his grandparents until the house is done. it has been six months since he moved out and we have been having a hard time seeing each other. the house has 6 months to a year of work to be done. in the meantime i want to rent an apartment to live together in. i think it will either help us to reconnect and get away from the stress of living with family or realize that we aren't meant for one another. i suggested that i pay for all apt bills and his money can be used on our future house. he is against my proposition and finds it is a waste of money. he wants me to move into his grandparents with him. i cannot do that considering his sister and s.o live there and it is a very small home. wondering what your thoughts are and if you have any suggestions for me to communicate with him on this issue. thanks!! ‚ù§Ô∏è	0

opinions on this group from a former radical feminist... i've been perusing these threads today and i'm actually in a way, **relieved.** (i should state i'm a millennial woman who has been exposed to the radical feminism of my day and used to adhere to those views myself). i still absolutely want equality between the sexes. i don't want anyone to be exposed to violence, injustice, or unfair treatment of any kind: men or women. i think both sides can seem "off the rail" and "deranged" to the other which leads to more violence and injustice. yesterday, i would have believed that most men were innately violent and unreasonable as the uncontrollable monsters you are often painted to be in radicalized feminist circles: shallow, unkind, lacking empathy, depraved, etc. i think it's important that everyone from both sides listen to the other, but it's incredibly difficult when emotions are involved. we all want a moral, just society. it's honestly refreshing to hear from this side in that you all don't want to be seen as rapists/violent offenders/etc., not because you're ***hiding something*** and want to discount honest women in pain, but because it's ***unfair***. men undoubtedly have their own issues unique to them and they deserve societal attention as much as women's issues. as shocking as it seems, we're all connected and our issues intertwined as well. i think women who believe that fellow women are always angels and can do no wrong and that men are the true enemies are seriously deluded. i think unkindness, hostility, and hatred are the true enemies: regardless of who it comes from. personally, i've had far more abusive relationships at the hands (and words) of my fellow females than from men. (except for my narcissistic brother and a few dumbass bullies in high school, but still). i've encountered more unkindness from females than males in my life. no sex has the moral high-ground. and it's a relief because honestly, i was really starting to live in fear of men perpetrating random acts of violence against me at any moment. it's great to see human beings as actual human beings, you know?? sure, there are psychos out there and i may be more sensitive because of my abuse, but it doesn't mean every man i come across is a depraved psychopath. it's dehumanizing. hopefully, others will start to find a peaceful way of living, too. it's exhausting to always assume the worst in other people. if i have more questions, i'd like to start discussions to gain more understanding. anyway, those are my two cents. thanks for reading! ü§ó	0

what are your coping mechanisms when you're nervous? haha, i'm having to do a few deep breaths because i'm so nervous just deciding to post here, eek! so, pretty straightforward, what seems to help you calm down when you are nervous? tomorrow evening i have a set of practical finals in hematology in which i have to successfully draw blood from a volunteer. i'm majorly nervous because my volunteer is my husband. i'm fairly confident at drawing blood, but i imagine i'm going to choke up on doing it to my husband; each time i've drawn from my best friend who is also in the class with me, i get really nervous because i absolutely don't want to stick a needle in her/hurt her, so i'm worried i'll do the same thing when it comes to my husband. i'm very nervous just thinking about having to draw from him. something i really enjoying doing when i'm nervous is coloring! it might seem immature, but i actually find it really calming. i imagine i'll be coloring a ton tomorrow during the day üòØ!!	0

girlfriend(f18) does not seem sexually attracted to me(m18) using a burner, for reasons **‚Ñ¢Ô∏è** my gf and i have been together for over a year. yes we have had ups and down, but all is normally good. one thing that i have noticed, is we have sex a couple time, and then go months without anything. i ask her, she says no, and i respect her choice. i asked her tonight why we haven't in a long time and she says "i don't want to". we have not had any sexual contact since december when it was our 1 year, and then she got an iud. since then, she as only hinted at it once (couple weeks ago, but i was at work when she asked if i was busy. i knew this was what she was getting at just based on context.) personally, i don't need sexual contact every other week like other hs couples, but it is nice, and i do really enjoy the personal connection. i have no reason to not "keep it home". i am extremely happy with her, and i am truly in love. i guess what i am getting at, is i don't understand why. anyone has insight?	0
crush on a girl with a boyfriend. advice? so i have known this girl, we'll call her bb for bad bitch. basically i've known bb for 3+ years now, instant crush. she's cute, kind, fun, has amazing energy, and ngl reminds me of a puppy with her curiosity. we're basically best friends at this point, she knows everything about me, as i do her. but here's the issue, she has a boyfriend. she's been through a couple these past few years, but i've always missed my chances due to leaving school and basically only having contact when we hang out every once in a while, or talk on social media. like if there was a prime example of friend zone, i think i'm in it. i know so much about her sex life, whereas mine is basically none existent due to lack of social skills and just focusing else where. she tells me positions, toys, etc, i don't mind because she's happy when she talks about it. i've seen her naked i don't even know how many times. from skinny dipping to revealing snaps to her changing in front of me. i've tried advancing my feelings towards her, she knows, i've told her a couple times now how i feel, but each time with a boyfriend i didn't even know she had yet aha. irony. i don't know what to do, she teases me because she knows i love sexual things, but i want to date her, i haven't felt that want in so long, and i miss it, every time i talk to her i think about the day her boyfriend might leave or something. idk. i just want her to be apart of my life like that. any advice on this situation? am i friend zoned or does she maybe he feelings for me? should i wait for an opening when she isn't in a relationship? or?idküò© tl;dr i have a crush on a girl who has a boyfriend, i need advice ü§ó	0
please read my post and help me make my dad's 90th birthday present special and, with any luck, it will help make your day a little special too! üòä this post is long but i hope if you take the time to read this story you might find yourself inspired to step out of your comfort zone and do something that scares you! or better yet, if you have ever suffered from depression or felt overwhelmed by life, maybe - just maybe, there is a nugget or two of truth in here that helps you! and sorry, there is no tl;dr. i think the heart of this story is worth a few minutes of reading effort. if you don't have that time to give, i surely understand. skip to the end and watch the video and leave birthday wishes if you aren't interested in the backstory. my father is an amazing man and is directly responsible for all that i have been able to accomplish in my life. he turns 90 on march 8th and i wanted to do something special to celebrate his life. the story that follows is the life adventure i have been on to accomplish that task. hopefully you will be moved by the story and will help make this a special gift for my father at the end of this post. seven years ago, when my oldest son was 16, he had a little garage band. now i have no idea where he got his musical talent but that boy just started playing guitar, keyboards, drums - pretty much anything. we built him a "music room" in the bonus room above the garage and he and his band would play all day and night on the weekends. those were really good times. now i don't have a musical bone in my body. i've never played an instrument and about my only experience with music had been singing in the shower and in the car when commuting to work. but my son's excitement about music inspired me and i began writing lyrics while i was driving to work each day. i would give him the lyrics and he and his little band would turn them into songs. it was fun, interesting, and a great bonding experience. about that time, i wrote lyrics about my father's life. those lyrics just sat on my phone for a year or two. then in 2014, my father was turning 85 and the family planned a big surprise party for him. i decided maybe there was something that could be done with those lyrics if i could just find some musically inclined good samaritan to help turn them into a song. my son was off to college by now and didn't really have the interest or time to help. so i turned to reddit. first, i began posting around on various subreddits to see if someone would volunteer. i was relatively new to reddit and really didn't know the ropes very well and had trouble getting any post traction. i remember bemoaning the fact that i couldn't find anyone to help and someone started a subreddit in that thread called /r/makemysong. i quickly posted the lyrics there to see if someone would bite. here's that original post which shares a bit about the trials and challenges my father has faced (and overcome) in his life: <url> well, a few people threw up quick shots at a song but i didn't get anything that resembled a viable song nor did i get an offers for a "collaborator" to help me. so there the idea died. or so i thought. flash forward to present day. my father's 90th birthday is fast approaching and with more "reddit wisdom" i thought, "why not try again". this time i researched music-based subreddits and decided to post a plea for help writing a song on /r/songwriters. you will see that the post (link in a second below) got literally 3 upvotes and that was all this little "diy" project needed to get off the ground. /u/elbow_or_gtfo showed up and threw his hat in the ring! now i had imagined that it would be a similar process to what i had done with my son all those years ago - i would hand my lyrics to /u/elbow_or_gtfo and he would unleash his artistic ability and drop out some amazing song that i would be able to give to my dad. but this adventure became much more involved - so much more personal, exciting, scary, and - eventually - satisfying. read through that post thread here and you'll see what i mean: <url> so i'm a guy that knows exactly nothing about music and yet i've somehow written and sung a song about my dad's life? by far the scariest thing i have ever done. and yet one of the most fulfilling. as the scale of this adventure expanded so did the ideas and work. my oldest son agreed to record the guitar track for the song. i reached out to all of my siblings and nieces and nephews to have them sing the closing chorus. and we decided to create a video to go along with the song that would use old photographs - the few we had from my father's youth - along with many, many pictures of my siblings and the 12 grandchildren - to tell the story of my dad's life along with the music. and now we are closing in on the end of the adventure. i've uploaded the completed music video to youtube. my dad's birthday is this friday so we only have a day or two to wrap things up. do you want to help me finish this project? if so could you please go to the video link below and leave a comment in the youtube comments section wishing my dad a "happy 90th birthday!" and maybe mention where you are from. i am hopeful we can get 100 birthday wishes for him from all over the world. in closing, i want to say this was the scariest thing i have ever done in life. i can't think of anything more petrifying than taking your personal thoughts and words, helping to turn them into a song, and then actually singing the damn thing for everyone and their brother to hear and make fun of. but you know what? never let your fear of failure - your fear of the unknown - stop you from trying something new. and just as importantly, hopefully those of you that are currently facing life's challenges will hear in my father's story some truths that can help you work through your current situation as well. peace! here's ode to billy: <url> please share the link on social media if you can to help get him more birthday wishes!	0

what should i do about a conflicted ex? long post so, this whole thing has been weighing pretty heavy on me recently and its been a big part of my life for a few years. its this girl of course. i'm 19 (m), she is 20. we started having a relationship almost two years ago at this point and it started out wonderful, she turned out to be my first real girlfriend and we both fell head over heals hard. we both have a lot of issues to ourselves, but im the type of guy who likes to work through problems and try and come out the other side better. she is a free spirit who does't know what she wants in life, but she's got a ton of energy and loves to do. or relationship started to get a bit rockey and she ended up breaking up with me. fast forward a month or so and she wants to get back together because she realized she made a mistake and we ended up getting back together. after that, she broke up with me a few more times claiming she needed to fix herself before she could come back to our relationship. what happened was that our relationship became toxic for a few different reasons, and she wanted to get out of it. and so did it. i consider myself an empath (someone who feels emotion more, has a heavier effect on me. aka someone is in a bad mood i can end up actually absorbing that energy and be in a bad mood myself) so many of the times she would be unhappy, our poor communication would lead to me picking up on her negative energy and mainly the poor communication would intensify the problem. i'm not blaming her for the negative energy, i didn't help the situation most of the time, but i always wanted to work through it and love her. we've been broken up since about june this past year after breaking up and getting back together almost every month since the first time we broke up. and i guess i broke the cycle this last time. she came to me over the summer after breaking up with me. (she felt like she wasnt able to be the best her for the relationship. and this one upset me because i told her i was scared to get back with her again because i thought she might randomly breakup again. and then she did...) so over the summer, she goes to a music festival and tries to get ahold of me to fix things, and my frustration and anger took control and i basically told her off for breaking my heart. then she gets into a relationship with a guy she met there, then fast forward to september. i don't know what got into me, but feeling of being betrayed for months and heartbroken changed and i decided to get ahold of her to see how she was and to apologize for all of my negativity. which is one of my flaws i've been working on for my whole life and im still working on. i think she is a part of that process. i almost think that if i can make things right with her, that i can solve my other frustrations, if that makes any sense. so i apologize and she starts telling me how her relationship hasnt been going amazingly and that she has been waiting for me to get back to her, and that she basically misses me. of course this is good news to me because i want to be with her and love her, and shes showing that to me as well. so we jokingly set up a date she is gong to come visit me, which happened to be the next day, and she comes through. we went on a date had some great laughs and whatnot, and then she comes back to my dorm where you can guess what happened. i thought i was in heaven lol. she still hasn't found anyone that she likes better in bed. same for me, which is sorta important. and then she leaves the next day and says "ill get back to you on if we are going to be a thing" after that, she went back to her boyfriend and decided to stay even though she said they werent matching well. so, i get super emotional because that really fucking sucked (no anger, working on it lol) and she basically stopped texting me as her answer of who she picked. should be over it right? get over her, get a new gf, move on, ect... and that's what i did. i found a girl who i found interesting and that went well for a few months. that girl and i ran into our own problems different to this other girl and i's, but i ended up breaking things off with her. but before we broke up (she cheated) i texted girl #1 out of curiosity. there's just something about this girl and i don't get it. there's no logical reason i can justify our relationship because of what happened between us. the goods were unreal, and the bad was really shitty for both of us, but here i am still feeling for her. but anyways, i started texting her again to kinda find out if she made the right decision, and after a few days of taking on and off, she told me that she's super depressed with this guy and is getting frustrated with him. "i'm holding on to the little faith i have left" and "he doesnt get my jokes and it chips at my faith" are some quotes from her. so, the new girl and i break up and i continue to talk to the first girl as christmas time starts rolling around. after christmas, we've talked to each other every single day. sometimes the convo turns into talking about sex because we both miss it with each other, other times its talking about dreams that the other person is in, sometimes its her complaining about her bf. after we started talking about sex more and more, i finally asked her what we are doing. she says she doesn't know and that it makes her happy to talk to me and that her bf knows and hes okay with it only because it makes her happy. so i ask, "should we really be talking?" shes admitted that i learned her as a lover and not a friend, so i feel that its wrong for her to have a bf and still talk to me. wrong because the dude is sorta being cheated on, and also wrong because i also want to be with her but im not able to. her response was "i need to think about this" and the next day we continued to talk like normal. fast forward a week or two and were still having convos about hot dreams and sex in general, and its like i fall in love more each day even though maybe i shouldn't. and she still hasnt given me an answer, but this whole thing has been on my mind 24 7 for weeks and its driving me up a wall. last night i told her we need to talk about it (even through text cause its hard to get ahold of her.) so i started telling her everything on my mind about wanting to be with her, and asking her why she's taking to both of us and i said this, "üòî i know you don't know what you want to do, but at somepoint you have to make a decision because it effects me too. sometimes you gotta make hard choices, and you can't avoid making one here no matter which way you go. you know why i'm messaging you and what decision i've made at this point. i need your response" to which she replied "i need some time to think about this" tldr- fall in love with a one of a kind chick, toxic relationship and on and off dating for 6 or so months after first breakup. she gets a new mans who she chooses over me, and then tells me it might be a mistake but she still hasnt decided and flirts with me even though shes still in a relationship. should i be doing this? is it worth it? am i in the wrong? what should i do? im going insane and i need your guys' help	0

dream girl february 2020, i have a dream, it starts off and it's my birthday, my dads in the room talking about something on the phone and he leaves. my step brother was also in the room and he says something about going to lunch and how it's my birthday and how he promised my father he'd take me today as a surprise. i declined as i was about to go on a date. the next scene in the dream was set up like a side scroller, i was holding this girls hand and we were leaping through ruble and flames as this city around us crumbled. there was nobody to be seen, we soon found ourselves scrounging for snacks in a disheveled meijer, and we were about to come out empty handed when we spot the corner of the store had caved in, there was a fancy metal garden table with just the snacks we were looking for sitting on the pile of concrete and roof tiles as god rays shown through an orange dust. we go to the table and take the snacks, it really would've been a neat spot for a date but instead we climbed up to the roof. we sat on the edge of the building overlooking the city. from there we watched a sunset so vibrant red and orange it almost matched the intensity of the flames dotting and covering the horizon below. i had that dream in late february. i met a girl in late march this girl, with out having me told her about the dream and before we told eachother how we felt, asked if i wanted to climb on top of this old building that she lives by, get some snacks and watch the sunset. i do believe i have met my dream girl. it feels like the stars have aligned and the gods hand crafted her she's perfect in every way and i'm not usually this much of a hopeless romantic but for her? yeah alyssa if you're reading this i love you more üòé	0

when i lie down at night, i start to think about things that usually never cross my mind. outer space, for example, amazes me considering... considering that it could go on and on forever or just stop? what comes after that? and then what comes after that? it still blows my mind!üôÇthese thoughts usually come late at night after i've lied down to sleep. it really makes me feel small sometimes. but also, it feels amazing to know that one day we'll finally be able to explore the vastness of outer space. anyways, hopefully i'll get some answered, and if not, then i'll just keep on tuning in to what nasa is doingüòÅ. does anyone else think about this? if so, what do you hypothesize 'outer space'is exactly?	0

i've told my best friend[24m] that my younger sister's[21f] cheated on him with his younger brother[18m]. now i'm guilty of destroying a relationship between siblings sigh......i'm sry to bother you with this guys, but there's not really any other place were i can let this out, so pls bear with me for a moment. my younger sister and my best friend were together for the past two years. i knew my friend since we were 9 and from that point on nothing could get in between us even though we have a fight like every week, but 5 minutes after that we're already doing stupid shit together. he's a very kind, but also naive person. he eventually got together with my sis, i played a big part in getting those two together, i always thought that both of them really love each other, i'm sure he did. but, just 2 weeks ago, i've caught her and his brother together in our house. me and couple friends ( including sis bf) went on a trip for 3 days, but i eventually got sick and decided to head back before it gets serious. he wanted to accompany me back but i've managed to talk it out of him, why should he not have fun because i got sick, that's what i thought. i returned home, went upstairs and eventually have seen them in my mom's bed ( who was on vacation). they were asleep, his used condom on the floor and it was just disgusting. i was so angry that i nearly stormed in there to kick his and maybe even her ass, but i calmed down, took a picture, and as my friend returned home i've shown it to him. i thought that it would be the right decision but now not only my relationship with my sis is ruined , that of his and his younger brother too and i feel very guilty of that. my sis said that i've fucked up a relationship between siblings, that i'm a snitch and that it never would've come that far if she handled everything. tl;dr- sister's been cheating on my best friend with his younger bro and i told him. funny side note: when i changed the sheets of moms bed i told her that my cup of coffee slipped outta my hand on her bed üòÖ really couldn't come up with a better excuse	0
my list of reasons keeps growing i feel like i'm just a couple of bad things happening away from killing myself. the last time i wanted it this much was 5 years ago. i've managed to cut most of the people who give a shit out of my life. i'm in a foriegn country, i'm low on money, i'm bad at my new job (got 2 verbal warnings for being late - i get the vibe my manager doesn't like me and just waiting to fire me when i fuck up again), i have no irl friends, skipping most meals, not sleeping well. the closest person i have is someone i've never met who lives in a different country. the exhaust gasses of my crappy motorbike can put me to sleep üëç proof of concept: <url> when i was younger i was scared of dying. now i just don't care enough to be scared. i know i have mental problems, i know this will only get worse as i get older, i know i have no safety net, i know that this is inexplicably what i've always been attracted to. i still have some hope for the future... not consciously but it's like a nagging inside. reasons to stay or reasons to go, i don't mind. i just want life to give me something i can be decisive about.	1
got a tattoo for my recent mental health relapse [here.](<url>) been dealing with depression for the better part of 20 years or so. i haven't had genuine suicidal thoughts in a few years, but came the closest i ever have to following through. it makes it so much more depressing; to think i was doing so well for so long, and i can still hit rock bottom the hardest i ever have. even though i didn't succeed, what'll happen down the road? will i eventually say fuck it to all the thoughts of "i don't want someone to find me like this or that" and just put a fucking gun in my mouth? anyway, i got this tattoo as a constant reminder to say "fuck suicide." it's only 3 days old and i still can't get out of this funk. sorry for venting üòî	1

somebody anybodyüò∂ no love for me i guess sigh anyway my mom took me out of school and she's telling me how to plan my future it makes me sad that she doesn't let me talk or have my own desire it's like my opinion doesn't mean anything so for the latest month or so of my homeschooling i haven't been doing much because she stressed me out about getting as and bs and i know i can't keep them because i'm bad at reading so she constantly stresses me out about making her happy but inside i'm sad because she's taken everything i've cared about away from me and i know she knows i'm sad but she doesn't care it's only about her so after i went with my little brother to his dads house we chilled and when i came back i was tjired and it's been 3 days and i'm still tired we have been low on food and it's hard for me because i workout and it feels like muscles are drains everything i eat i'm becoming so depressed i no longer have a life and she's mad at me because my room wasn't clean (only thing dirty was clothes on my floor no roaches or food comes in my room)and she said to me "ur fucking stupid, i don't love you anymore you don't love me,ur dad ain't shit u gon be just like him and st one point i was close with my little brothers dad i looked up to him and she said he doesn't give a fuck about me and that she can't wait for me to get out of the house and that she can make me sleep outside it's legal so now i just don't have anything left	1

forgetting social decorum at my wedding this happened on saturday, and i'm still cringing. i got married to my lovely wife (!!!) over the weekend. i was pretty overwhelmed when she came down the aisle in her dress and she looked so amazing and beautiful. we did the whole "hug the parents and get up in front of the officiant" thing and once we were up there, i just took a minute to appreciate how good she looked. she was wearing a really sexy dress that was tight down almost to her knees. her backside looked great and i gave it a little squeeze. she jerked away from me and looked at me with so much disbelief and then i realized what i had done. we had our backs to everyone and they all just saw me grope my wife. the groomsmen and bridesmaids were cracking up. my in laws and my mother looked horrified. i'm surprised my wife didn't leave me right then and there. we managed to mostly pretend it didn't happen and move on with the wedding, but once we got to the honeymoon suite, my wife wouldn't let me consulate the marriage until she could express that i am a dumbassüòÖ. but it's okay, all is forgiven and maybe she'll laugh about it in 5 years. maybe. tl;dr i grabbed my wife's ass in front of everyone we know.	0
sometimes i jus realize how wild symptoms of mental illness must come across 2 people who are jus like. fine üòµ tw disordered eatin . . . like uhhh i havent eaten in almost 36 hours. partly coz i was too depressed to get out of bed at all yesterday (& tired coz i stayed up for 24 hours which is a whole different story) n partly coz im like hehe ..... me skinny .... so i wanna put off eatin as long as i can & when i do eat "regularly" theres ~12 hrs between meals && if someone else was doin the same thing i would be like please take care of urself:(( is there anythin i can do for u ? coz i recognize that its awful. but when i do it im like hehe yeah this is great stuff good job. the cognitive dissonance is unreal this is just sooo normal for me n has been for a rly long time now. but i think if someone without any kinda mental health issues reads this theyre gonna be like. what the fuck thats insane get help anyway i am considerin eatin coz ive been cravin tacos but itll probably take me a couple hours to get out of bed. & im kinda dizzy wonder what thats about üôÑ	0
i'm a dodgeball face magnet whenever i played dodgeball in pe, at a kickback, or an event, i always got hit in the face. no, i didn't get hit by some little throw - it was given by that athletic kid with their big arm and it's strong, powerful throw. more than half the time they were aiming at someone else, so i never even expected it! another thing: i wore glasses, so they always got knocked off, just to make the scene even more embarrassing. and this happened, i repeat, this happened, every. single. time. i. played. dodgeball. after about my 20th game (over the years) i just chose to sit out immediately. i was so done with getting hit in the face with a dodgeball. no matter where i was, what time of day, if i was playing a game of dodgeball, i was gonna get hit in the face. if i recall correctly, i still got hit a few times while i was sitting out! ~you don't have to read this paragraph, it's just a specific example (i apologize in advance for this being so long) i once went to a youth group thing in middle school with one of my friends, who had invited me. a group of kids were playing dodgeball indoors, and we decided to sit in the back of the room against the wall, away from it all. then of course, out of nowhere, the ball came flying at me and bam! right in the face - again. by this time i was used to it, but i hadn't realized that they were playing with a volleyball. i just laid back against the wall casually, acting like nothing had happened (after my friend asked if i was okay). then, my nose started bleeding like crazy, so a leader that happened to be there rushed me to the bathroom and helped me clean it up. now, i think to myself, those days were in the past. tonight i went to a kickback with my friends, and guess what we played? dodgeball. i was a little afraid at the thought of playing it, but i chose to anyways. for the first three rounds i was doing fine...by that, i mean face-wise, if that makes any sense. but if you were speaking on terms of winning...well, i was always one of the first people to get out. on the last round, i had been out for a while, so i was sitting on the floor (the rule in this game was if the dodgeball touched you, you had to sit where you got out). this one guy who was still in had the dodgeball, and was aiming to throw it at someone on my left. so i think, hey, i'm sitting down, they're up above me - i'm fine. but hooo boy was i wrong. the dodgeball was really light, so it didn't travel very far when he threw it with full force. sooo yep. it hit me in the face. he said, "hey, pause the game, pause the game!!" then ran over to me saying how sorry he was, asking if i was ok, etc. definitely the most genuine apology i've received from someone who had thrown a dodgeball at me. üòÇoverall, the situation itself wasn't very bad, but my face still stung and it was red from the pain, mixed with embarrassment. the reason i wanted to share this is bc it just annoys me! like, ik it's something minor, "wtf why do you care about some dodgeball games," yada yada. i get it, this shouldn't matter. it's just a small thing that frustrates me from time to time. my question is, even when i avoid playing, (or i'm not in) how do i still manage to get slammed in the face with a dodgeball?? do i have some magical talent that allows this to happen every time? i almost want to say "it's not even funny" but i mean, c'mon...my dodgeball problem is strange enough to make me laugh a little.	0

i fell hard for a fuckboy üì∑ tl;dr: i fell for a guy that told me he wanted to have fun and be single, but would get drunk and completely contradict everything he said. i have been single for over a year now. i was lonely and wanted to meet someone to date. went out with a few friends but no one really caught my attention, and i didn't seem to catch anyone's attention either. so i decided to try okcupid. met a few guys but nothing really clicked. i am a gemini, i love to make jokes and have a good time. one day, i swiped right on this really cute guy, let's call him jr. he responded and we talked religiously through instagram, snapchat and texted.. after about 3 days we scheduled to meet up at a bar. it's been wayyyy too long since i met someone i find really attractive and also enjoy talking to. he really got my humor, he wasn't disrespectful through our conversation, and he didn't bring up any sexual topic, so i was feeling pretty good about it all. we took a few shots and moved to a different bar. i asked the big question to him. "what are you looking for?" he responded with "i am not looking for anything but if it happens it happens. right now i am enjoying my single life." after the bar we went to the top of a parking garage. we went outside and just surveyed the town with his arm wrapped around my waist. it felt really good to be touched again. without much thought we had sex in his car that night. it was amazing. sexy and passionate... something i haven't had in awhile. that night he texted me if i made it home safe. i didn't respond till the next day and our conversation went well to the point he asked to see me again. but this time to meet his friends. to me that was a huge success. he did not msg me until a few days later, asking to hang out again. this time i brought my best girl friend and he brought his boys. my best friend acted as my eyes and ears to see if he was interested in me or just playing games with me. i was a bit tipsy and to avoid showing him how i really felt, i talked more to his friends and decided to give him less of my attention. my friend said it seemed like he was enjoying my "hard to get" act. he tried all night to talk to me and each time i was sassy and just played it off cool. my friend even told me that night all he asked and talked about was me. he asked my friend if i was seeing anyone, what i like and don't like. it felt very obvious to me and my friend that he took high interest in me. i was so fucking happy. finally at the end of the night i gave in and we had amazing sex again. i was torn between "will just be hook up buddies or morph into an actual relationship?" i didn't want to rush anything so i decided to wait a little more before asking any more questions. next friday he took me and my friend out for clubbing. prior to that was talked non stop through snapchat. he was friendly, asking me about my day and it was nice. i booked a hotel room so i don't have to drive back home which is an hour away from the club. this time, he also brought his "female friends." as it turns out, he had met them all through dating apps, and one of the 3 girls he brought in was getting his undivided attention. he tried to talk to me, but i was jealous, i couldn't help it. so i played harder to get - i was embarrassed to ever think that we might have had something. it felt too late to back out so i let it go and partied. but my pride was hurt, so i called another guy i met on the app and brought him to the club. it irritated jr, but he did nothing. i was on my way home with that guy when jr called to check up on me. that confused me more. after that night, our conversation died down. he treated me more like a good friend than a love interest. i didn't want to ruin my chances even more, so i acted as a friend. that next weekend we went out to party again, and i invited another guy; i didn't want jr to think i didn't have options. but this time, he was surprisingly more attentive toward me. he wasn't flirting with any other girls. i really liked it. a lot. at this point i wanted to univite the guy but he was already on his way. eventually the guy i invited came and he was really nice and handsome, maybe even a better option for me than jr. he gave me the undivided attention that i wanted, and was compassionate and relaxed. unfortunately, i was already emotionally attached to jr. we partied and i tried to be polite to the guy i invited, while still giving jr the majority of my attention. eventually jr got tired and we all left to go back to the hotel we were staying at. on the way jr told me: "i am done with girls, it was a huge lost today." he didn't specify why, but i believe it was because most of the girls he talked to through the apps just end up with different partner in the end and not with him. he asked me who was the new guy i brought and when i told him the whole truth to why i even invited him in the first place, he sound disappointed. but what really changed the whole game is when he said " i think you're really beautiful, i love you as a friend and if you ever need help in the future i will always be here. but i only see you as a friend" i was so confused. if i was just a friend why be so attentive towards me? it was just me, jr, my best friend, and the guy i invited staying in the hotel room. my best friend was hammered so we put her to bed and i stayed up to chat with the guys. it got really deep. jr opened up about his last relationship, how it didn't work out, and how alot of people think he is a player now, but in reality he just feels insecure and talking to more girls gives him confidence. but as jr got more drunk he started saying things like "i really like you," "you're so unique someone will definitely like you for you one day." i was a little drunk too, and we ended up kind of having sex in the hotel bathroom. after all this happened, i expressed to him over snapchat that i really do like him and i was okay with him not feeling the same way. he response was: "you're catching feelings too quick. i think you're an amazing person but tbh i met alot of ppl but i just don't feel like i've met that person i am willing to settle down with. we're only young once and might as well enjoy it while we can. ppl lie and all that shit. no girls will fool me. i don't care what anyone says until the time comes, i just want to enjoy my single life." a week later he posted pictures of him flying to another state to meet up with a girl he'd been talking to for about a year. she was extremely pretty and i was really envious that for someone who is a huge playboy, he was willing to fly all the way to another state to spend time with her. üì∑ maybe it was just the sex that gave me this emotional attachment. but i know for one thing, being with him made me feel really happy. even if it was just a one month fling. i've never forget all the roller coaster feelings i had with him. deep down i wish some miracle occur and he would turn back to feel the same way about me. but i know the reality and i guess i just have to live with it.	0

i feel no matter how hard i try, he's just not happy. throwaway account since he knows my other one ‚ù§Ô∏è. boyfriend(28) and i(23) have been dating a little over a year. everything was going great until recently. it was okay until it wasn't. i have every quality he supposedly looks for in a woman and i do my best to try to do things each day to make his life easier. he never actually appreciates it anymore and just notices the things i don't do. i don't hear about anything that's bothering him about us until i basically pry it out of him. i get that he's stressed out about money, new job, family, etc but i don't think it should be taken out on me especially since he refuses to talk about the issues. it's seeming more and more like this will just lead toxic but a few people say i'm over-reacting. help :( tldr: i may be in a relationship that's going toxic and i'm not sure?	0

close friend wants to be gone from this world soon my close friend has suicidal tendencies whenever she and her girlfriend fight. two weeks ago, she sent me a picture of her, slashing her wrist a bit below the pulse. i immediately alerted her family: mother and grandmother. they found her locked in the bathroom, conscious and she was okay for that night. but now, she and her younger siblings are far away from their home, a plane ride away. earlier this night, she told me things aren't going well with her girlfriend. they're in a long distance relationship but she thought that person doesn't love her anymore, for some reason that she doesn't want to tell me. their communication went cold. she kept saying that her only solution is to kill herself. she sent me a goodbye, told me that she'll be gone by tomorrow morning (it's already 2 am here.) the only person who could stop her is communication from her girlfriend. because of their quarrels, she's thinking that her girlfriend doesn't love her anymore. i went to message her girlfriend of the situation to please reply to my friend, to fix their relationship, and to stop her taking her life. i did the best i could, calling her sisters the moment she thought of suicide two days ago. i told them to keep all sharp objects, toxic chemicals, blades, keep them locked and away from her reach. to prepare to call for help in an emergency. told them to talk to her, remind her that her family appreciates her. i feel so helpless, being miles away from her side. i'm doing as much as i can to do what she wants. i feel the burden, i want to save her life. i let her know that i love her, i care for her, i appreciate her being. "hi, i just want to let you know that you are worthy, and that you are appreciated by someone. just keep living üòä please remember that your family loves you. your friends love you. i love and care for you." is what i told her, but she kept refusing to look at life because "so? all i need is her." tl;dr a girl that i love had issues with her girlfriend. she told me she's committing suicide when an opportunity comes. she's far away from me, i alerted her sisters but for how long can we prevent this. i'm doing my best to reach out to her but she doesn't want to listen to me. what else can i do to save her life?	1

i'm not sure if i should tell my friend how i feel so i had a snap streak with this guy (let's call him j) for almost a year but we only started talking at the end of last summer, a few days before the school year. we've been friends since, we don't talk much at school or in person but we text and snapchat pretty often. so j asked me to prom about a month ago and i said yes. prom happened last weekend, and i think we had a good time. the after party on the other hand, that's a different story... this was the first big party i went to and i don't drink very often so i didn't know my limits. i had quite a bit to drink and i was totally wasted to the point where i couldn't walk straight or keep my head up. i like j a lot, so naturally, being drunk, i kinda made it obvious. i told him he was the cutest guy at prom and i asked him if he liked me, to which he replied "you're alright." because i couldn't hold myself up, i was hugging him and holding his hand. we were basically cuddling most of the time lmao. he was caressing me but i don't know if that means anything. fast forward to the next day, we talked on snap for a bit and things seemed okay between us but as the week progressed, it just became weird. i felt like j was avoiding me or that he hated me but i didn't ask him about it because i didn't wanna make things even more awkward. people were asking us if we were a thing and someone posted a sarcastic comment on my instagram picture of j and i at prom implying that we were more than friends. i thought that might have pissed him off so i felt like he was distancing himself from me. so today we've been talking all day and this morning we cleared the air, he told me he was irritated that he wasn't able to enjoy the after party because i got so drunk (but he said that he wasn't mad or irritated at me, just at the situation) and he's not mad that i got drunk, he just didn't wanna feel obligated to take care of me which i guess i understand, it would be annoying if you had to stay with your friend the whole night cause they got hammered. i kinda felt like he didn't care about me when he said that but he could have just ditched me and handed me over to my best friend but he didn't do that so i guess that says something? i'm not sure. i confronted j about being cold to me this week and he said he just felt awkward because he didn't know where we stood after the party (i guess cause we were cuddling and shit?) and he isn't good at handling situations like that. i'm still trying to figure out what this all means but i don't think he likes me and i don't think he ever will. that might be my insecurity of "no one will love me" talking, so that's why i'm posting this because i wanna get a fresh perspective on this situation. i think j and i are pretty good friends and he means a lot to me, so i don't wanna ruin what we have by telling him that i like him in the event he doesn't feel the same way and things just get awkward and we stop talking :/ i tried to make this as short as possible by leaving out any irrelevant information but it still seems pretty long... oops üòÇ	0

and i'm the selfish one. the asshole he calls me.mom made me marry him at 17 in chester, va. i gave him my virginity. he gave me herpes. we had a quick 15 minute ceremony at a lawyers office. my honeymoon took place at the sheraton on midlothian tnpk. special....until he said he took all his gf's there. a year later we moved in with my grandma to save money and get a house. at this point we were the proud owners of a ford festiva, $155 a month. he worked at the local ford dealership. needless to say we couldnt move an apartment full of furniture in that micromachine car. so he bought an f150. $330/month. why did we move to my g'mas? i went to see my cousins baby with my g'ma. he got mad and went out drinking. drove home down the train tracks. i had two daughters while living in that basement. he had 2 motorcycles and a boat and a bronco. after 5 years i got the hell out. to the second apartment. i got a job cleaning houses. i bought me an $1100 1980 something mustang. we moved into a trailer. i bought me a new 1999 mustang. we moved 2 more times. i got a job driving a school bus. i went to college inbetween. we moved in with his mother so i could attend nursing school full time. big mistake. quit and went to respiratory school. moved to the east coast of va. he bought a bigger boat since we were on the chesapeake bay/rappahannock river. i tried several times to buy a house, turn down after turn down. at one point before nursing school i wanted to volunteer at the resque squad. he wouldnt allow it. i would be around men...at night. so i worked in a hospital full of men. things that can be done in a confused patients room. woooo guess who got fired and found a job working at nigh? you guessed it. not me. effing hypocrit my daughter turned into a holy terror. didnt listen. came and went as she wanted. had 2 kids i had to take care of at night. had to put up with her shit and the trash she brought home. they didnt listen either. i begged my husband to quit his job. i needed him there with me before i killed myself to get away from the shit. i hated to come home after work so i would stay with my other daughter at her house. we filed bankruptcy after his heart attack because he "couldnt" work. finally left the state to get away. this summer 2019, we were close to buying a house. until he saw an expedition he wanted. what was wrong with my equinox at 191 a month? 538 for the expedition. i let it known that we would not be able to a house again. do you think he cared? he wined like a damn kid until i couldnt take it and said go fucking get it. im living with my mother in law. i have als and i'm dying. not quick enough. i married the most selfish sob ive ever met. i have came to the place i literally hate him. i want to die to get away from him. im not perfect. the night before we got married i was with my exboyfriend. who, after 27 years i found him. i learned a lot that i didnt know was going on in his life. i wish he would have talked to me about it. i showed my tits to a few people. some got to play and kiss them. few years ago hubs dick stopped working due to meds. seems to me if you actually loved your wife you could make lifestyle changes to get off heart meds or use other means to get your wife off. so i think he doesnt care. i got' caught sexting with other redditors. that didnt go well. i was diagnosed with als in the morning and he bitched me out calling me everything he could that afternoon. i guess having been given a death sentence i forgot to delete his texts. i want a clock that tunes on the hour and to go to the mutter museum and die in my own house. do you think that he would do either for me? nope. i stay in my bed doing suicide searches online. i just want to die and leave this miserable life of mine. i love ma and pa and my 2 brothers i love my daughters emily and tiffany. i love my grandaughters peyton and lucy. i love my future sons in law justinü§ûü§ûand manny there are my 10 reasons for hanging on. suicide still crosses my mind hundreds of time a day. if you read this...thanks. mariann	1

shutting down.i honestly tried to write a deep story of my life and why i'm so fucked in the head like 3x but what's the point. i can't recall the last time i was genuinely happy and i don't think i'll get the feeling ever again. i tried to commit suicide before and failed. mostly due to being nervous and being on impulse. i've tried the whole "hold on to life, it'll get better" thing and it's been 9 years and i'm almost 25 and guess what? it hasn't. still unemployed, still degree-less, basically homeless sleeping at random homes of the junkie acquaintances i've made. i've come to terms with the fact that i'll never have a loving wife and kids. i've come to terms with leaving the small amount of people if any that'll mourn my death behind. i'm tired of this feeling. of being alone, of never being loved, of being worthless. knowing that when i breathe my last breath absolutely no one would give a single fuck. i honestly envy people who don't have to deal with waking up in the morning, crying, because they're still alive even though greater people than me have died while i'm here wasting away. it fucking sucks, id gladly trade my life in a heartbeat for someone more worthy but it doesn't work that way. it's selfish of me to take my life that was given to me by my parents but i didn't ask to be born. looking back my only regret is not doing it right the first time to save me from becoming even more empty than i am now. i do however have the perfect playlist, final meal and spot in which i'll take my life. where i can stare at the beautiful night sky, floating away while the drugs and alcohol finally take toll on me. it may sound scary or stupid or whatever but fully planning it out and not on a whim like the last time makes me feel super calm and ready to end this fucking suffering. ‚úåÔ∏è	1

tifu didn't use jack stands while working under a car. fell off the jack and onto my face and chest. i'm by no means a mechanic. sometimes parts malfunction and as a member of the portion of society that lives paycheck to paycheck, sometimes you have to just figure it out. yesterday i was attempting to replace an ac compressor. i was using the scissor jack that comes with the car, a friend was helping. i knew to put the tire under the car at least, but i was just trying to reach a bolt real quick and forgot. he leaned into the car, i saw the car start to move. by the time i saw it, the entire weight of the car was sitting on my chest and head. it was a truly frightening 6 seconds. my friend tries to lift it, he relieved the pressure so that i could breath. i yelled for him to get it off and my girlfriend who had walked inside for a second came running over and helped. i was able to get out. thankfully i'm fine. a little beat up, but entirely whole. don't take shortcuts. you've got time to do it right. this could have all been easily avoided. another friend had a floor jack and jack stands they were going to let me use, but i didn't want to wait on them to get back home. it almost cost my life. tl:dr didn't use proper safety equipment while working under a car. car fell on face and chest. alive but dumb. also that bitch super icy now ü•∂	0
saying something nice about someone else! it feels nice to give doesn't it? maybe it is a feeling of building some good will with a team mate or friend. it helps reinforce the internal idea that you are in fact a good person. or it helps grease the wheels on you getting some nice words back your way! so i want to use this space to congratulate others. you can give someone a shout out for doing something cool! this is a great chance to spread some positivity that we all want to see more. so even if you don't share it with the intended person every one else gets to see that someone else has been a light in another's life. _____ thanks for reading üêª	0

i just got out of surgery. i got what was thought to be either an "oil sac" or "hair sac" from my right thigh, close to my weenier. but it turns out it was a muscle, or a small piece that was basically a muscle, it used to be small and it irritated me and it hurt whenever i moved my leg, but then was given medicine and it was supposed to disappear, but it only got bigger, but it stopped hurting when it became bigger. 5 months into the whole situation i got the surgery done just now, it was the first one i had done that didn't require to put me to sleep, so i was awake during the whole thing, but luckily it didn't hurt much, i felt little burns close to the end of the operation, which i assume it was them stitching it and cauterizing the place, they took it out and said it wasn't and oil or hair sac, but another muscle, i don't know how it became bigger or what caused it to appear, but the doctors didn't know why hair or oil sacs even appear, so i assume the are oblivious to how this muscle appeared out of nowhere. currently it kind of burns, even when i don't move my right leg, but i'm fine with it, i hope that the burning feeling isn't gonna stay during this whole day, but i'm limping because it kind of hurts, and i can't take painkillers because i take take all kinds of other medications, so it isn't good for me to take them. here's a picture of that ["muscle"](<url>) (nsfw, please don't click on it if your squeamish it's a little out of focus since my mom took the picture, but if you don't want to look at something like that, then please don't click on it. anyway, thank you, und goodbye. i love you üíö.	0

how do you tell the difference between friendly and flirty? so i've known this girl for a long time and we've been pretty good friends for a while now. she's easily the best looking girl i know and i've told her that multiple times. she's really touchy with me a lot and when we were in the car the other day she started playing with my hair from the backseat and pinched me on the neck (it was a pretty hard pinch actually üòÇ) and said "let me give you a hickey" and she just started laughing. it's so hard for me to tell because none of my other friends who are girls do that stuff with me. i always keep eye contact with her for a long time too and i always found that funny because i'm a pretty shy person. she's sooo cute and sometimes i just wanna go in for the kiss but everytime i back out of it but when all that stuff happened the other night it really made me think. what do you guys think? has this kind of stuff happened to you before? i just need some advice üòÇ	0
new year's always makes me a lil' sad not sure why, i usually spend new years with good friends, having a good time, celebrating and all that jazz. but around this time of year there's a real general awareness of the passing of time that doesn't exist in other parts of the hear. this like, hyper-cognizance makes me feel very aware of the meta we're living in, ya know? especially new year's eve, when we're counting hours, minutes, seconds. i always become very aware of my personal human experience‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. like, i'm here, breathing right now in this moment, on this day, living the one life i have to live and i gotta make it count. even when i've head good years- like this year i got a new job with better pay doing something i really like and working with people that i love, in an awesome community. it's just always a question of, but am i doing it right? i see people kiss each other, i currently am not in a relationship and never really have been (which i've been wanting lately, as i get older), i see people getting new jobs in places like new york or chicago and obviously making more than me (but those people were finance majors, which would have made me throw myself off a cliff and money isn't super important tbh), among other things, and i just think, am i doing it right? is this sufficient? am i making the most of this moment/time/year? i don't have any other chances. i always try to do my best, and generally feel okay about it, but new year's time always makes me doubt. i kind of wish we didn't celebrate it. it would take the anxiety away. i usually enjoy myself regardless, but the worry paints the celebration with a veneer of doubt. anyone else feel anything similar? how do you deal with/approach it? thanks for listening!	0

question for my mexican/hispanic/latinx/spanish speaking/etc. people so idk if a lot of people will find this relatable or not, and this doesn't just apply to spanish speaking people. anyone can relate :) i just didn't know how else to word the title lol, sorry. but anyways so my mom is outside in our garage just sweeping and cleaning a bit and she has some spanish songs playing. i went outside just to see how she was and i was like, suddenly hit with this wave of nostalgia. when i was little, like 4-6, we would always have music playing, (like literally everyday. we'd be playing music at some point throughout the day) and my mom would be cleaning, my dad would help out, my brother and i would be playing, running up and down the stairs, dancing in the living room... and i was like 'damn. life was amazing back then.' back then, i could run around without a care in the world, just belting out spanish songs with my dad, dancing and just being a kid. life was just so much better back then. now i'm stressed about school and life and honestly, it doesn't suck, but compared to back then, it's crappy haha. i'm not depressed or anything, but i just really miss those times where i had no cares and was just worried about having tea parties and drawing and dancing and just having fun. covid definitely hasn't helped at all. does anyone else relate? like, do you guys ever remember those amazing childhood days without a care in the world just filled with love, laughter and fun? sorry if this makes no sense, i just felt like getting it all out cuz being stuck at home, i don't really have anyone to vent or gush to about stuff lol. anyways, that's all, bye‚úåüèº	0

by accidentally telling my girlfriend's dad about our stoned sex plans during a trip to visit him. my girlfriend (sandy for this purpose) and i live hundreds of miles away and we get to see each other every so often. long distance is hard, but when you find someone as kind, loving, and gorgeous as she is, you make it work. it's lovely time when we do connect and we always look forward to it for the obvious reasons: spending time with each other, eating yummy food, and sex -- a fantastic activity absolutely worth trying. in a few weeks, i am hoping on a plane to meet her and spend 10 days on the road driving around to go meet various members of her family, including her father (carl for now) -- a kind man in his late fifties whom i've met just once before for an ice cream cone without his daughter around. that's a story for another time.... anyhow, we've chatted a few times since in a family group chat that i was graciously added into a month or so back. my comments lean towards the "impress the family and don't say anything dumb" tone and so far i don't think i've blown it. back to this trip... being more a of a shoot from the hip kinda guy, i benefit from having a partner that plans things out down to the very last detail. this trip is no exception. with weeks to spare, she sends me a rather thorough itinerary via google docs. it has my arrival times, the restaurants we'll visit, the wake up times to catch sunrises on the road, and so on. being the responsible young man that i am, i make a few choice edits, including "post arrival sex for a few hours" and "super high sex for a few hours" immediately following the scheduled trip to a dispensary and finally, "sex and snuggles before dreamland." she sees these comments and laughs before editing things out and calling me childish. fair enough. tonight i'm sitting with my newborn niece appreciating the end of a hard days work and admiring the pure ness of a child with my phone across the room on silent. i stroll over to take a peak and there are a handful of texts. no worries, let's take a look. one from a buddy, one from sandy, and a handful from the group chat with sandy, carl, and her brother. she's telling them about the trip and for convenience, she sent them our itinerary via google doc. it's been a few minutes since sending, but just to be safe, i open that bad boy up to see what's planned. apparently "post arrival sex for a few hours" and "super high sex for a few hours" are still on the agenda and carl and her brother are very much in the know! fan-fuckin-tactic. only time will tell how this trip goes. but if initial responses are any indication, we should be just fine. "and you don't have to broadcast you sex schedule. it takes the romance out of it making it a duty. consider it a given. üòäü•ûlike morning pancakes! ü§£" -carl, sandy's dad tl;dr: my girlfriend sent her dad and brother an upcoming trip itinerary that included private details like "stoned sex."	0

dealing with loss hypothetical‚Ñ¢Ô∏è situation: you're one of those people who never really liked being alive, but you muddled through because you didn't have the heart to inflict the alternative on your family. one day, through dumb luck, you meet someone. if you were the kind of asshole who believed in true love, you might think this was it. they make you happy, they make it worth waking up in the morning, you can see a future with them, not just that but for the first time in what feels like your entire life you can see a future where you're actually happy, and not just slogging through life wishing something would finally kill you. they feel the same way. you both want that same little cottage, and there's no real reason you can't have it. one day, they need to run some errands. you get a terrible feeling about it, and ask them not to, to just stay home with you. they don't listen, they tell you it's just a quick train ride, that they'll be back soon, that they love you, and that you're kind of always with them. turns out you were right. not long after they get off the train, they're struck by lightning. they're dead by the time they hit the ground. if you had a soul to sell to bring them back, you would. you can't bring them back, and nothing you can do, no amount of money, magic, or anything else will change that. now what? how do you keep going? why do you keep going? i have no fucking idea, and i really wish i did.	1

i am strongly convinced that my muay thai instructor committed suicide yesterday. i probably cannot think about killing myself again. i have trained with my private lesson instructor from 8th grade to 12th on a consistent basis then had some lessons during recesses during my freshman year of college. i was going to schedule private lessons this summer but then my father stumbled across the post on fb. from the bjj academy. the caption had a quote about weakness and the internal and external. someone left a comment saying that they were sorry that they could not help. i am convinced that my instructor took his own life. he was a step-father, husband, trainer, coach, and champion. and he is now deceased. one of the other guys who trains under him made an instagram post with a caption "‚ù§Ô∏è you will always be in my corner." and this is what hurt me the most. some of you may not see it now. but if you were to commit suicide, you would destroy a lot of people. my father and i were not extremely close with my trainer despite how often we went to training. most of the chat was about ufc but he was not that interested in me besides that. however, it brings the two of us great sadness given how monumental he was in bringing me past my limits and how he has destroyed those around him. suicide should not be an option. i have underwent a lot of depression and i have been mentally hospitalized and attempted suicide before. i am not stranger to misery. but i will never think about self-harm again now. cannot say for you guys that things will get better. i do not know your situation and i would hate to bring false hope. but you matter somehow. always remember that.	1

one last goodbye hi, so this is kind of a goodbye statement or something along those lines. i have decided to end my life as of june 1st. i just wanted to thank you all for your nice words & messages! i really did appreciate you guys trying to help, i wish you all the best my friends. i also wanted to say that nothing anyone will say or do will convince me otherwise i've literally tried for years now. i've packed my things, wrote a couple of letters to a few people who might be want to know why i did what i did etc. i've neatness up my room too and i'm prepared. i tried ending my life a couple of times but none of them worked, i either bailed out or on one occasion the rope snapped and i could bring myself to do it again, so this time i've decided that i'm just gunna jump into the canal so i will know there's no going back. i am much calmer now that i've accepted what i'm going to do to myself. i haven't been this calm in years in fact. anyways i genuinely appreciate you guys for trying to understand me. this is me over and out. goodbye üëã	1

i just took a blast to my past on a kpop forum... i was so fucking annoying holy how did i have friends on there jesus christ . i'm crying though :( i met some really chill people there including this one girl (though at the time she was an entity to me with no gender, ) and it was a weird hate love relationship (no romantic feelings lol might've just been my hormones) :( and she was like 21 at the time and i was like 15 and that's so surprising considering the maturity difference but omg :( we would joke around and i'd drag her faves through the ground. then there was this tumblr page that got made and people called me annoying on there and i got hella depressed because i had no life in real life and that place was my only source of happiness. looking back i'm not surprised at the amount of haters lmao. oh it's just all very nostalgic and i want to cry. i logged in anonymously to see my old posts and inbox, but most of them were deleted and the ones that weren't, were recent and were not during my peak celebrity phase on there ü•∫ i'm only kind of sad i lost all my friends i made there since i left since i'm not comfortable being friends with people when i'm not happy.	0

i (22f) don't feel like my boyfriend (26m) is attracted to me. is it in my head? here's the backstory: i come from an emotionally abusive home and have had one past relationship with an abusive ex. i am very insecure and always have been. however, i met this guy about 4 months ago and it's the first time i've felt genuinely comfortable with a guy, including casual flings, etc. we started off very casual but ended up growing feelings for each other and establishing a serious and exclusive relationship. things have been tricky because of my past, issues in my current life as well as his etc, but we support and help each other through it. he's the first guy i've had feelings for who hasn't belittled me, etc. honestly, i thought our sex life was great. we had sex once or twice every time we saw each other, i gave him head all the time which he loves. i know he is a tad bit shy, plus i am his first relationship since he was in high school so i know he's learning how to be expressive in a relationship. i know this because i asked him on his birthday when we were getting at it "it's your birthday, what do you want?" and he looked a little embarrassed and just said "you haha" and it took him a few moments before he asked if he could cum in my mouth and i was like, of course. then over text he brought it up saying he liked it- he would often only discuss things he liked the night before over text and in kind of a shy manner. i thought it was sweet and knew he was getting closer to opening up so i was giving him time and letting him know that i want to know what he likes so i can make him happy. it took him months to admit he had always wanted to eat me out and finally do it. so there's that. so in my feelings of comfort, i playfully brought up the idea of a threesome with another girl. it's a fantasy of mine. he was all for it but said "i don't wanna mess things up with us...are you sure?" i told him yes, but it's just an idea for now, and we could actively pursue it in a few months maybe. he agreed. we don't sext too often, because we see each other quite a lot, but i was out of town and we began sexting and it was really hot, then we starting discussing the threesome and he went into detail about what he wanted. it surprised me but again, it was hot and i was into it. however....in the past few weeks things seem different to me. he also went on a trip, and each night i wanted a video of him cumming (i love it) but for him to get there he'd bring up the threesome and one of the girls i had specifically showed him from tinder (different girls on different days, i generally show him all my matches to get his opinion). he also said that for the girl he preferred blondes with blue eyes (like me). as for the body he said a big ass that's not huge, and big boobs over tiny ones. well....for my size, i have an ass. i definitely had an ass when i was ten pounds heavier but he met me after i lost weight (i'm really tiny) due to my anxiety and some health problems. and for my size, i'm not flat by any means. i'm a 30c, which is like a 34a, but on a smaller frame. i would categorize my breasts as tiny. and i wouldn't call my ass big. so basically, he prefers my opposite. i did bring that up, saying i didn't want to attack him for his preference but i was now curious if he really did like my body seeing as i'm so petite. he said he did. but sometimes he doesn't cum when we have sex. like last night. and then he went soft. i know he was tired and sweaty, but he lost interest. sometimes he gets tired and i finish him off. i'll send him texts telling him how hot he is, how much i want him and he kind of responds okay and sometimes not at all. i cleaned his house for him and he texted a thank you and i said "anything for you" to which he said "anything??? üòè" i said yes with more sexual emojis, and he said "watch the game with me?" that felt great. i just said sure. he said he only said that to surprise me. i said i wasn't surprised. i sent him a meme about being in a relationship with someone who is too hot for you and said "how i feel about you" and he just said lol, is that why you can't sleep? (the meme was people laying in bed awake at night) also felt great. now, i'm not feeling comfortable enough for the threesome although it's still a huge fantasy of mine. he doesn't bring it up much honestly, but he did ask if i was still gonna hang out with this tinder girl (i said i wanted to chill with them first and get to know them) i said maybe, and he went on about exactly how he wants to fuck us both and want he wants to do to us. still, it's hot, so i was into it and all but tried steering the conversation more towards just us, saying "oh by the way when i give you head next i want to try this..." he said it was a good idea but kept on with the threesome thing. he said he anticipates cumming like 3 times, but last night....he didn't cum once. he had said it was super hot upstairs last night (temperature wise) and he was sweating so i said "haha maybe if we keep the ac on you can go for that long!" and he said "if i get frequent head i can definitely go that long. " i'm still over here like: you didn't. cum. once. last. night. is it me, physically? is it him? or am i just over thinking? cause i feel like he just wants to fuck other people and can't even be that excited for me... tl;dr: summaries are hard	0

having trouble getting over a relationship. they lied about things; but i still love them like a family member... throwaway account because people know my main one. i'm having a real hard time getting over a relationship with someone i built a bond with. to preface; they have issues they are getting help with. we met online 2 and a half months ago and i fell in love with them. i gave them money because they needed help and bought them stuff to keep them happy with anxiety and depression. after awhile they found someone and i didn't know the truth behind things until recently. they lied about things and i don't blame them for what they did. they're young and have mental health issues. i moved on when they found someone else and eventually found someone myself; but we created a bond. i can't say i didn't get jealous for a bit and kinda made them mad; but i wasn't meaning to do the stuff i did. i apologized and i know i have problems too. we both went too far on things. they learned their lesson and are getting help. medication and therapy. i learned too. they helped me and i helped them and i love them like a family member! i know they feel bad about what they've done; but i don't blame them for anything. i understand they have issues. they want to start fresh and by doing so leave me and i'm crushed. they don't want to talk to me. i just want to be a friend! i don't want to be a constant reminder of what they did. i never wanted to be the one who caused them problems. i also at least got them help. the way they were going; something was gonna happen anyway. i hope they can put it in the past and we can talk again one day.... i feel like i lost a lover, family member, and friend... i just worry about them and i love them! i kinda just want to die. help me! edit: i guess here i'm just gonna say it because age and gender has to be included. sure they won't see this anyway....so for more context we're both male. they said they were 18 and strung me along through this to get things that would calm their anxiety a bit. worked for awhile.....i guess in the end they had to be honest that they were 16. i don't blame them; like i said. sooooooooo much pain üò¢ tl;dr: met someone online. talked for a bit. fell in love with them. they met someone and we both moved on from that part; but wanted to stay friends. they actually lied about their age and felt bad about it and finally told me. they left me to worry about them because i still love them like a brother. they have anxiety, depression, and other issues and are getting help; i just can't not worry......	0

absolute abundance in dating. # "abundance mentality" is something that's frequently prescribed as an answer to men's neediness issues: approach anxiety, having a "weird" or "awkward" vibe, escalation hesitation, failure to invite women home. anything where a guy comes off as hesitant or is nervous about achieving a certain outcome. men who know there are women everywhere, and know they can *get* women whenever they want, goes the thinking, won't worry about it. but in fact, **a standard abundance mentality will only get you halfway there**. this article's going to focus on what i call *absolute abundance* - something that goes beyond ordinary abundance. first though, let's have a look at what an abundance mentality is, and how you can work to develop one. üì∑ ## abundance mentality abundance mentality is **the name given to the feeling, the belief, that a man has abundant options with women**: that there are attractive women everywhere, and that he can get them with relative ease. once a man achieves an abundance mentality, seduction seems like a vastly easier prospect, and far less work. of course, getting there is easier said than done. i'd say it took me a good three years from the time i really began training seriously in the social arts until i reached a true abundance mentality. for me, the realization came when i took women home three nights in a row on vacation, and i saw that i had reached a point where any night i put enough effort in, i could take women home. it was reinforced further that year when i worked on street pickup, and found i could reliably bring women home most nights i went out just from meeting girls on the street. once i reached that point, all my old beliefs about women being difficult and challenging to get and about seduction being this tough skill i still had to master fell away, and suddenly getting girls seemed like a game i had mastered. after three years of hard work and sporadic results, it became straightforward, and i achieved consistency. **but abundance mentality is not achieved in an instant**. rather, it's built up to over time, as you develop more skill in seduction and things become clearer and easier to control, and the fog that hangs over this area of most men's lives fades. the better you become at seduction, and the more you understand it, the more of an abundance mentality you naturally develop. it's also developed through experience. **if you've only ever dated a few women, women will feel like scarce resources that are hard to come by**. but if you've dated many, and if there are always women in your life, they seem like far more abundant resources. you don't worry so much about them - they're just there. if i was to recommend a process for developing abundance mentality, i think that process would look like this: * **absorb information on understanding women and social dynamics**. a lot of men who dive into the social arts work on learning routines, pickup lines, and various things like that. all those things are short term fixes - they're band-aids for a lack of understanding about why things happen the way they do in social contexts, and why women are the way they are. the more you understand women and socializing, the easier a time you'll have figuring out confusing or novel situations, and the faster and more consistently you'll start getting results with women. * **practice, practice, practice**. **the number one key to developing an abundance mentality is getting** ***results*****, and the number one key to getting results is getting out there and meeting women**. **lots** of women. not a few a week. a **lot** of them. you really need to be serious and meet lots of girls and push to move things forward if you want to get to a point where you're consistently finding success with women and build a real sense of abundance. * **move somewhere with abundance built in**. if you're living in the country, and there are ten beautiful, available women in your entire town, you will never, ever develop an abundance mentality. i promise. at the very least, move to a city with a lot of beautiful young women. if you're more ambitious, move to a city in a *country* with a lot of beautiful young women. compare osaka, japan, or florence, italy, or (so i hear) buenos aires, argentina with any city in the united states (my home country), and what will you find? *vastly*more women who are thin and attractive by comparison, and an average body size that is much less likely to tip the scales. **if you're used to going to the club in the states and seeing three or four girls who** ***aren't*****overweight, you'll be truly amazed stepping into a nightclub in a major city abroad and seeing it filled with beautiful thin women everywhere**. instant abundance. * **get ambitious**. are you [inviting women home](<url>) regularly? if not, you likely have no real idea what women would go home with you, given the opportunity, and what women require more work. i just brought a girl home with me a few hours ago who was trying to go back to her own home because she said she had a lot of work to do before she went to class tonight. but i invited her back with me, and she came. **abundance is heavily influenced by how many women you're bringing home, and how easy you think it is to get them home**. if you're not trying, you might be surprised how easy it is to get a girl alone with you. that's abundance mentality. getting there is no piece of cake, but it's certainly achievable. once you get there, though, you've only made it halfway. because on the other side of abundance mentality, we have an entirely different beast: ## absolute abundance what's *absolute abundance*? it's something i became aware of last year as a once-wonderful long-term relationship of mine wound down. i knew logically i should let my girlfriend go - it had passed the point of no return. but i wrestled with the decision. *she's such an amazing girl*, i thought, *i don't know if i can ever find anyone as incredible as her*. i'd roll through the list of her qualities in my mind and decide i didn't think i could. i realized in retrospect that despite my feeling of abundance in general, i was lacking a feeling of abundance in another way; **i lacked the feeling that i could find amazing women easily**. sure, i could go out and pick up a girl to spend a night with; but if i wanted to find another beautiful, intelligent, dynamic, ambitious, successful professional woman with a high degree of in-built loyalty and affection and devotion... could i? before, i met maybe two or three women who met those very specific qualifications a year. that meant two or three chances a year to get myself a girl i'd be willing to invest the time and effort into building and maintaining a long-term relationship with. yikes. better not blow it when those chances appear. and that's *exactly* how most guys feel about women in general; it's another shade of scarcity mentality. it's scarcity of a particular type of woman; in this case, the kind of caliber woman i look to have a long-term relationship with. i lacked absolute abundance. but, i soon developed it - perhaps nine or ten months after i'd developed ordinary abundance. which is something i find interesting - i see guys who've had abundance mentalities for *years*, and still get quite hung up on the rare girls they meet they deem of high quality. **they've had abundance for years, but still haven't developed absolute abundance**. why is this? i think the reason why is that most men who teach themselves to meet women focus solely on the meeting part, and aren't choosy about the kind of women they maintain relationships with. they tend to turn girls they aren't crazy about into friends-with-benefits, and then sometimes fall into relationships with those girls. their standards for women they'll sleep with and women they'll date aren't all that different. i'm a little different. i don't do the friend-with-benefits thing anymore, because i don't see any long-term value to it. if i just want intimacy, i can spend time with my girlfriend, or i can go out and meet a new girl. it doesn't make much sense to me to keep seeing a girl i'm not crazy about. this is similar to how i am with friends - i have a lot of friends, but mostly only spend time with the friends i find pretty amazing. there's a learning curve with this kind of thing. it meant that, for a while, i didn't have a lot of friends, because it took me a while to figure out how to meet amazing people, how to *spot* amazing people, and how to bring them into my life. in the meantime, i was spending a lot of time with only one or two friends, or by myself. similarly, with women, it takes you a while to learn how to spot amazing women, how to meet them, and how to bring them into your life. **once you have it down, however, you're set**. it's just like meeting women in general - get the skill, and you're on easy street. once you know you can consistently meet the kind of women *you* consider amazing - whether that's the kind of women i mentioned above that i consider amazing, or whether it's different kinds of women altogether - you will have achieved absolute abundance. here's what i think the keys are to absolute abundance, as far as i can tell: * **abundance mentality**. without abundance mentality, absolute abundance is out of the question. work on standard abundance first - and worry about this later! * **known standards**. know *exactly* what you're looking for. you have to know what it is you want before you figure out how to find it consistently. so, if you like brown-haired women with a fiery disposition, or you like blondes with big breasts and glasses, or you like latinas who wear suits to work, know that. what kind of looks do you look for? smarts? education? career? upbringing and background? wealth or property? personality? independence? devotion or loyalty? how passionate must she be? do you want a woman who seeks novelty and is a thrill seeker, or one who's quieter and more conservative? you must figure all these things out before really getting a clear idea of what you want. * **putting yourself in the position to meet the women you want**. if you want women who like to relax and kick back and maybe go surfing and light bonfires, london or new york city probably aren't the places you want to be living. conversely, if you want women who are ambitious, successful, and upwardly mobile, those cities are excellent choices. in addition to actual locale, you can look at *where* you're meeting women - women in loud dance clubs are going to be more likely to lean one way; women in upscale lounges another; women in dive bars still another; and women in salsa bars another yet. women who spend their weekend days at the coffee shop vs. the bookstore vs. the beach vs. the park are all going to be different kinds of girls. look at where you're meeting the women you are, and ask yourself if you're going to the right places. * **connection-based courtship**. a lot of guys i know and am friends with are party guys specializing in party girls. which is lots of fun, for sure. i made it a point to learn how to consistently get party girls. but, for relationships, party girls aren't what i want; and in my experience, they aren't what the majority of men want relationships with either. yet, the higher quality women tend to be pretty adept at screening out party guys - which means that a lot of men who've specialized in getting party girls often aren't able to reliably get higher quality women. the way around this is connection-based courting and socializing of women. **when you get good at connection-based courtship, you can very quickly find out a great deal of information about a woman, and get her feeling extremely connected to you in a hurry**. this is what most higher quality women respond to. higher quality women are accustomed to being approached and courted constantly by all kinds of men, and they mercilessly screen out the party guys whom they can tell aren't really interested in them as people. high quality women will still have fun - but usually with safer men or men they can control. when it comes to dating, they want men they feel know them well and understand them and make them feel very connected and cared for - because they know they can get that, and they expect it. * **life-improvement and development of social class and grace**. the higher you go in quality of women, the tougher at screening those women get: they aggressively screen out men who party too much, men who lack ambition, men who lack class and social grace, and a host of other factors. like all people, high quality women are searching for men they can relate to - men who are as ambitious and successful and driven as they are. you don't have to have your act perfectly together - i'm by no means financially well off, with an uncertain future, and no promising job prospects at the moment, on any continent - but i'm dating a beautiful, confident girl with a porn-star body, a conservative upbringing, a highly prestigious professional job, who is in the process of getting her mba, and she buys me food and brings me gifts nearly every time i see her. despite my shaky situation though, she sees that i'm an intelligent guy who's got drive and ambition and wants to do something with his future - whatever that might be - and i treat her well and make her feel things no other man ever has. and i do it all with class - my current girlfriend says that she rejected men for a year after she broke it off with her fiancee a year ago, but she liked me because i was a gentleman (and she still considers me a gentleman, despite originally getting very upset and embarrassed by how quickly i bedded her); indeed, my last girlfriend said something similar (she would always reject men who approached her, but i seemed different), and a good friend of mine in california, an attractive, successful professional woman, would typically only date more refined, professional men (with the odd suave seducer thrown in for good measure). all these girls are **very** high quality, very attractive women, and they all routinely reject the loud, crazy party guys. **the classier the woman, the more class and ambition she expects from the men she dates**. i'd say i realized i'd reached absolute abundance when i got to the point that finding amazing women no longer seemed like a challenging prospect. meet enough super cute girls, and some of them are bound to be amazing. that and - and this one's the kicker - **knowing you've got what it takes to hold onto those amazing women** are what grant absolute abundance. **knowing you can meet them consistently. and knowing you know how to keep them once you've found them. that's absolute abundance**. not all men will tell you they want successful, high class, high society women with good breeding and education and who take great care of their man and are devoted. "a cute party girl is enough for me," a guy might say. you know what i say? that's settling. it's like the guy who's had three (short-lived) girlfriends his entire life who says, "i'm not going to bother studying seduction, because i do just fine with women." he doesn't want to go through the painful process of learning and growing and challenging himself, so he settles. **i challenge you to strive for not just abundance, but absolute abundance**. i challenge you to make yourself into a classy, driven, suave man that high quality women desire. do well with party girls, for sure, but also position yourself to find success with the best women out there. only then will you feel truly in-control of your dating life, and have the comfort and the contentedness that comes from knowing that you have an abundance of the world's most amazing women. chase amante	0

i [29f] feel like my best friend's [44f] husband [46m] was being inappropriate. tell me i'm overreacting please. so i recently moved across the country to close the gap on the ldr i was in. i didn't have any friends for the first three months and it was really hard, then i met k. k and i are two peas in a pod and i flipping adore her company! we get along monstrously well. i've met her kiddos a few times and i love the crap out of them, and they return the feelings. i recently met her husband s. k and s were the picture perfect image, you could feel the love between them. the way he looks at her was wonderful, they are genuinely close and it's just great. i even said to k a few times "when i grow up, i hope my partner and i are like you guys". i look up to them a lot, despite having only met him once, they're just so damned down to earth. k and i are catching up for lunch tomorrow and i had the following message exchange, i know i should've just stopped replying. however, i hoped that the behaviour was just my misinterpretation, i was also a tad oblivious initially, because this is my friend's husband! why wouldn't it be innocent? s: i hear you have a date tomorrow me: i do i am so excited omg s: i hope you behave üòâ m: never! i'm pretty sure you've met me, sort your expectations out haha s: are you naughty? m: ha! suppose it depends if you're asking my mum or not. pretty sure i've grown out of that. s: what if i'm asking you? m: then i'm not sure what you're asking. i'm pretty sure i'm going to heaven, like 90% haha s: let's talk about that 10% m: lol no. what are you and the young ladies getting up to while i steal your wife? (it is a running joke that i like to steal k) s: stealing?... mmm can i watch? s: we need to talk about that 10% s: enjoy lunch tomorrow m: will do is there a chance this was all just like... inappropriate humour? i feel so upset, confused and uncomfortable. i don't know why to say to k, if i should at all. i don't know how to handle aaaanyyyy of this. my fiance says i just need to block him, but i can almost guarantee he'd tell k that i blocked him, she would then ask why... maybe i'm catastrophising, i don't know. **tl;dr i'm pretty sure my best friend's husband was hitting on me, feeling very disappointed, sad and uncomfortable. how to fix?**	0
fuck my life.i can't go one day without having a panic attack and hating myself. i can't even function properly. i can't taste food, i can't feel anything but pain. and worst of all i'm the loneliest person on earth. doesn't matter no one cares. no body will miss me and no one will remember me. i was just a waste of flesh a walking thing that roamed the earth for 19 years searching for something to live for. unfortunately i couldn't find one. all that's happened to me is my heart being crushed. i can't take it anymore üò¢. no one cares. everyone ghosts me who tries to "help". i just wanted to find love and be able to smile. but i guess that's reserved only for the rich and those who don't deserve happiness. i hate life, and life hates me. how can anyone live happily? how is happiness a emotion? because to me it's a figment.	1
don't know what to do anymore i have quite a lot of issues. i have depression, anxiety as well as autism. i also get really disturbing thoughts in my head, so things have been pretty difficult for me recently. however, today, i iust don't know what to do anymore... i'll try and explain. just over a year a go, i got a girlfriend and honestly, things were amazing. i was so happy in the relationship. yes, i still did have some bad days, but she was there for me. she would comfort me and make me happy when i was upset. i love her so darn much. today, she called me saying we should break up. she said that we were drifting apart and things didn't feel right to her. i'm absolutely heart broken and devastated. i know it sounds cliche, but she means everything to me. almost all of my dreams and plans for the future revolved around her. we spent so much time together and had so many good memories, and she just ended it. i tried persuading her to give the relationship another chance, she said she didn't want to. she has some bad stuff going on too (she lost her grandfather recently) some people say it's stupid to kill yourself over a break up, but i just can't help how i feel üòî i'm at that stage where i want to commit suicide, but also have some doubts about it at the same time (like being scared to do it and not wanting to upset my family) to be honest with you, i probably won't do it, but it's so tempting. it's the worst feeling i've ever had in my life. i'm guess i'm posting this for advice and your thoughts. tldr: i have some issues, girlfriend of over a year broke up with me, having suicidal thoughts	1

i'm 100% certain that i'm going to kill myselfi don't like the person who i've become. just too much loser behavior for too long. didn't give a fuck about my health at all. used to smoke way too much. who does that shit? giving yourself cancer ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è mom died too young and my abusive piece of shit dad helped me become the mess i am today. i remember at 17 i was so fucking motivated and wise, ready to make something of my life and filled with intrinsic motivation to be better than him.. and then he killed himself and i got an inheritance. i remember thinking to myself: i don't want this fucking money because i knew it would turn me into a sloth, but of course i just accepted it. would coast through life without feeling the need to fight anymore. so until i was 27 i would just constantly smoke spliffs and cigarettes, only ate garbage and lived without any focus. last summer i woke up, became obsessive, filled with regrets. a tragic mess of a person. would even whine to my ex about my failed life. she just mocked me and her insults kept repeating for 2 months. fuck i'm pathetic. no coming back from this. i suck and i'm too weak. time to end it. it sucks because my girlfriend is trying to save me, but i will send her my last money so she will have something better than my garbage personality.	1
i think my friend is committing suicide and i can do nothing my friend has been acting off lately and depressed and i've been there for him but just know he texted me "goodbye‚ù§Ô∏è" and i can't get a reply or even contact him. i don't have his parents number or his address and can't do fucking anything. i talked to friends of his and they are trying to figure out too. i feel so fucking dumb. i was planning on killing my self this week and then this happens. how could i ever put someone through this? i don't even know if he's trying to commit. i don't know anything and that's the worst fucking part.	1
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è haven't got off the couch all weekend. had my heart ripped out (again) because apparently i'm a bad judge of character. she convinced me that she was different.... i don't even have the capacity to go into details right now beyond i can't stand women anymore. i've taken about 15-20 sleeping pills in the last 36 hours just to keep myself sedated- though i have also taken enough to vomit. i wish i had the courage to die. i had two dreams last night where i did. dreams, not nightmares. my neighbors are gun-owners and the thought crossed my mind last night to "break in" to their house and have them shoot me, but that would only cause them a lifetime of pain and confusion and guilt. it's the people who care about others who end up hurt the most. i wish i could stop caring. but i'd rather die for who i am than live for what i'm not.	1
kid stares at me in summer school hey kids i'm a 16 y/o girl that's a junior in highschool, in my other post on here i mentioned in summer school, and i sit on the last row to the left, there's a kid that stares at me every day that sits to my right, which puts him right next to me and once he spilt his vanilla coke and it splattered on my and my desk, i looked up at him and he looked scared and said "sorry" in a shaky voice, the another time he stared at me for an hour straight and then left to go to the bathroom and comes back 3 hours laterüòÇüòÇüòÇmy friends say he thinks i'm cute and likes me, but summer school has been in session for a month and a half, and he still hasn't made a move? i mean he's cute to but this was just a fun story to share	0

y'all, i am this ü§èüèº closei can't hold a fucking job to save my life. everything is falling apart. i can't get approved for medicaid but i can't afford health insurance so there's therapy and medication out the window. and if i break my arm, i'll have to heal it myself i guess. my student loans are way over $28,000 even though i only went for three semesters and don't have a degree. i'm $5,000 in credit card debt. i have adhd and anxiety and agoraphobia and depression and i can't treat any of it because i'm broke and i'm broke because i can't hold a job down because of my sick, sick brain. i am so close. so close. i have nothing. i'm so far in the hole and i'm not even 23. all the credit card companies keep calling me but i can't answer the phone because of my crippling anxiety. my bank account is -$360 and they keep calling me. i don't know what i'm going to do about rent and food. none of these dead end jobs provide any sort of training so i can't hold onto them. fuck. i just want it to be over already. why won't this nightmare end?	1

the us government knows i like to eat ass. this just happened 40 minutes ago. i'm dying inside. there's only one person in the world i feel comfortable enough to talk to about it and she just had a baby so she's busy. i'm a 33 year old woman. i'm single and finally decided a few weeks ago that it's time to start dating again. i met someone awesome. amazing body, childfree like me, kind and adventurous, you get it. he also works in nuclear energy for the government, twelve hour shifts overnight. his career being what it is, the location is very secure, no cell phones allowed anywhere. he is, however, issued a government cell phone that he can use while at work. he tells me "i'm going to use that to talk to you but you have to be really careful about the language you use. you can't say things like 'bomb' or 'gun' or 'blow up' or anything that would draw their attention. like, you can't even joke about it. they monitor conversations very closely." now let's back up to last week. i enjoy eating ass. i told him so, and he said he would let me, but has to get more comfortable with me first, yadayada. i've been teasing him about it. you can see where this is going. we had been texting on his work phone throughout the night, him when he can and me when i wake....really boring conversation. welp, my alarm goes off this morning, i review our messages and think 'these are really lacking energy, i'll make it interesting'. so...less than 12 hours in to being given his work number and all the warning labels that gift came wrapped in i sent him this. "but i get to see you in like, 6 hours. i'm gonna make out with your butthole üëÖ" he replied with the raised eyebrow, straight faced emoji and it was only then that i realized my fuckup. i know better than to try to redeem myself. this isn't just about our budding relationship. i could have seriously fucked up his job, even if only his credibility there. i'm a jackass.	0

3 things i learnt when i was a buddhist monk i want to share with everyone the 3 things i learnt as a buddhist monk and how it has shaped the way i perceive the world, changing the way i live my life. briefly, it's how understanding cause and effect develops our wisdom, how experiencing impermanence brings us peace, and how practicing mindfulness leads to fulfillment. being a buddhist monk taught me to understand the benefits of loving-kindness and compassion by deeply experiencing the effects it has on myself, the world and the people around. in turn, buddhism teaches us how we can create immense joy and happiness and become the source of love and harmony that everyone needs and deserves. i wrote about my experience in more detail in the article i've linked below. please have a read if you can spare 5 minutes. thanks for your time üòä [<url>](<url>)	0

f/25 got out of a long term 5 year relationship m/25 and just confused about it all i'll start off by saying i'm not necessarily upset, moreso just confused. i was with my first and only boyfriend from ages 20-25. (i'm currently 25) i experienced all my firsts with him - sex and experimenting, moving in together, getting pets together, etc. we've always had a sort of rocky relationship full of mistrust and not handling things properly in retrospect, i think it's because we were both so young, dealing with our own issues, and figuring out what we wanted in life over the last couple of years, there were defining moments filled with toxic aspects on both ends- however i felt like his were more extreme i was dealing with insecurity and jealousy issues, whereas he was dealing with his temper/anger anyways, over the summer i found out he had done things like pay for tinder premium, and he couldn't pay me rent in over 6months, and went to a strip club by himself when i was on a work trip. i ended the relationship and asked him to move out at the beginning of october i had told our mutual friends that we both met while in college what had happened but i'll preface and say over the years these college friends were more my friends than his because he never made any effort to hang out or talk with them after i kicked him out, he wanted to stay friends which ended up leading me to let him move back in then he announced he was going to take a private guard at a military base in another country overseas so he quit his job in december and lived with me until he left march 1 he didn't have a job and had sold his car so he was üíØ dependent on me and was severely addicted to weed and i could even say he was low key addicted to porn. anyways last week he told me he just wants to be friends and not date i was fine with because i think mentally i never fully came back into the relationship and he's in another country anyways but then last night he texted me out of nowhere basically saying: i've blocked you on everything, i don't want to be your friend, i cannot be friends with someone i hold content and resentment towards. and someone who has turned my friends against me. i'm sorry for being a shitty pothead and i wish you well. and it was so strange! this came out of nowhere. i'm not sad or anything, i'm just curious as where this is coming from. i hate leaving things on bad terms. he still owes me quite a bit of money and i really hope even with everything, he'll pay me back. any advice is appreciated. i'm just trying to process it all there is a lot i left of but this is a small gist of it tl:dr; no longer with the person i spent 5 years with, just trying to cope	0

losing my keys and getting banned from the gas station when i get gas, i usually go inside for snacks and chat with the cashier. i sat my keys on the counter while i gathered up my munchies and got carried away chatting as i made my way to the door. when i was finished pumping my gas, i realized i didn't have my keys on me and my heart dropped. after the longest 15 seconds of my life, i remembered leaving them on the counter. no big deal, i'll go back in. well the real fuck up was a month or two ago when i thought it'd be funny to use one of those keychain labels to attach to my shed key. it wasn't even original, just a patton oswalt joke "uncle touchy's naked puzzle basement" the cashier looked mortified as i stood there oblivious as to why she didn't wanna give me my keys back. as she slowly passed them over the counter, i saw the tag dangling and tried my best to hide the perfect o shape plastered on my face. i made my way to the door, just soaking in the embarrassment when the man in front of the door propped it open for me. "i don't care if it's supposed to be a joke or not, i don't ever wanna see you back here, guy." i wanted to explain, but at the time i couldn't even remember the context of the joke to start describing why it's so funny. now i can't go back to the most convenient gas station ‚òπÔ∏è tl;dr labeled my shed key "uncle touchys naked puzzle basement" as a joke and got banned from my local gas station when the attendants saw the label.	0

deciding to live. feeling the desire to live. and how i did it. and no. this ain't no sales pitch, bitch. this is my life. this is just informational. ‚ù§Ô∏è if you check you'll see, or maybe you've already listened to me lament into long posts about my neuro dis-ease or my deeply broken heart, soul crushing loneliness, and despair. well, i had started receiving ketamine infusions this past october and they worked but the boosters, well they weren't quite doing the job, obviously. then i learned that dextromethorphan, the ingredient in cough medicines with a "dm" signification, is a nmda antagonist with the same mechanism of action as ketamine (google the crap out of that). this is why street drug users (no judgment) drink bottles of it. there's a subreddit for that btw. but let me be clear: i was not interested in that. i was interested in using it properly treat depression and my neuro condition, which included crps, which ketamine is also used to treat. so after discussing it with my pain doc, an anesthesiologist, she said to try it. so i did. at first it made me woozy and i think it may have given me diarrhea for several days. it make me talk in my sleep and have extremely bizarre dreams. but i knew it was working. after some dosage tweaking i wound up taking 6mg (1ml) every 6 hours for a total of 24mg a day. that's a pediatric dose btw that can be given to a child twice a day. i take the delsym 12hr extended release but i didn't like the up and down that i could definitely feel so i took it in smaller doses 4x a day. and after the first week and the dose adjustments all the weird stuff went away completely. and the results are amazing. i feel happy. not a suicidal thought in my mind. i'm not sad or despairing. when i think of what used to hurt deep in my bones it still feels sad, i get a twinge in my stomach, but i'm able to gently turn those thoughts off where as before i couldn't stop them. i still feel. i'm not numb. i don't feel drugged. i just feel normal and content. i squeel and stretch like a little girl when i wake up instead of waking up frozen and unable to hardly breathe feelingv90 years old. i do things. i get up! let me repeat that - i get up! if you are where i was you'll know just how huge that is. and my little dis-ease that ketamine is also indicated for is...well actually it isn't. and i've begun to successfully begin reducing opioid pain meds! 5% reduction and only 3 days but hey! if you only knew what a big deal that is! anyway, i'm just a weirdo on the internet. so don't listen to me. if this sounds good to you, do your homework! talk to your doctor! i'm not one ok? not even close. just beware that a lot of doctors scoff at any thing not on their fda approval list or that isn't a big pharma drug they can get a kick back on. so you know, make sure it's safe to take it by all means but remember some doctors are good and some are bad. always look out for you. beware it's contraindicated for anyone on ssri / maoi! read the label before taking any drug! one last thing. there a prescription drug - neudexta, that uses dextromethorphan with quinidine. quinidine is just a prescription med that makes the dex extended release but because quinidine is prescription only they could add it and essentially then make otc cough medicine prescription only and sell an 8$ med you can get at any drug store for god only knows how much! big pharma. such greedy sinsters. however, their website is useful in how to use the medication and how much. they rx this for a brain condition called pseudobulbar affect. have no doubt- dextromethorphan is a brain drug! it even prevents coughing via the brain! anyway, their website has some useful information. particularly that only very tiny doses are required to get dramatic benefits. very tiny! i know there may be one other person on the edge out there looking for an answer, who doesn't want to suffer any more and this just might be the answer and this post is for that person. who knows. but if it's safe for you to take it (you can ask a pharmacist too) it's so easy to get, it's cheap, and it could save your life. good luck. remember to to do your homework. and i love you all! ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

feels like the end is getting closer i can't take the stress of life any more. i've failed to live up to my self-imposed expectations, and now all thats left is a nervous wreck. i have no legitimate purpose on earth. i don't know why i had such ambition in the first place; i'm a laughable excuse for a hardworking student at this point. i should be ashamed of myself, and i am. thank you to everyone who has reached out to me, and sorry for deleting and reposting so frequently. i'd convince myself i could get myself back together but looks like i failed to do that for the 1000th time. i'd rather people carry on with their lives than deal with me and my never ending list of shortcomings. always angry and sad with no end and sight, but i frequently think about making my own end to alleviate this excruciating burden, which is selfish in itself. üò™üò™üò™	1

suicide is not a joke....well i ponder around thinking about life and how to fix it. i go from feeling like i have a purpose to where i just don't know what to do anymore. it's been going on for the last couple of weeks. it all started on the first day of my 6th grade year. at the end of the day we do silent sustained reading, i had my book down on my desk reading and my pencil beside me(it was a led pencil). so what happened was i set my book up and grabbed my pencil and started stabbing myself in the hand, i put so much pressure that the pencil made a little bitty whole in my hand, i ended up doing that twice, not screaming bc of the pain. i have been thinking of a way to do it but i'm too scared to do it, half of me wants to live and the other half of me doesn't. i'm the biggest fan of markiplier and have always wanted to meet him in person. i love him, he means the world to me and if anything happens to him i'll jump off a bridge, and i mean anything. nobody cares about me or what i do and nobody wants to talk to meüò≠üò≠ -alana‚ù§Ô∏è	1

i (21m) am in one hell of a love triangle and could use some advice on what's wrong with me. i am a 21 year old guy living in ca i'm in the military and i have about 8 months left before going back to ny. if you read my previous post, you know i have a girl i met here and we're currently working on being just friends and it's going ok but i am in love with her. here's where it gets weird, i've also been talking with another 21 year old (f)emale and me and her get along great although she's very flaky. she's canceled on me 3 times (including tonight) and has told me i'm not her type (not a skinny, college educated boyüòÇ) which is fine i'm not looking to date but the more she flakes the more i'm attracted to her which i find really weird. and when she told me i wasn't her type that made me like her a lot more too. now tonight i went to a local bar and had a great time with my boys and it ended with a stupid ass fight and i met this beautiful short hispanic woman who is 26 years and a mother of 2 with an 11 year old. (i didn't know all this until later btw) we went out to eat at a diner and talked and i really vibed with her even with the current baby daddy drama and the kids and i'm actually about to see in her in about 2 hours for some fitness thing. basically i just need to know if this is normal, if i'm being rational or acting on a broken heart. i don't want to hurt any of these girls and i don't feel like i will but i would like someone to tell me this is normal and i won't hurt anyone. if you believe i will, let me know and i will tell them that i'll stop talking to them. (btw all of them know i'm leaving california in november) tl;dr: in a love triangle with old flame, fwb, and newly met single mom, need advice to avoid hurting them!	0
sleeping with my gf's mum i don't know where to go from here... i live in a pretty big town, however, there are only three *decent* clubs so it's pretty common to bump into the same strangers every now and then. a couple of months ago, i was at this nice rock bar with a live band; drinking with a big group of work friends. i notice a blonde woman has glanced over a few times so i go up to her, make some small-talk and ask for her number as i couldn't really leave my friends. we text a little bit but nothing came of it. a week later, i bump into her again and we talk for longer. decide to grab a couple drinks and i end up going back to her house to spend the night. i noticed she was a lot older (maybe around 40) than anyone else i've slept with before, and i'm 21, so pretty much double my age - but she looked good so i figured i'd learn a thing or two. all i've learnt now is how to regret more efficiently. i move on and forget about her. a couple of weeks ago i met a girl, 19, on tinder. we hit it off and after a few really good dates she invites me back to her place (i live a 20min drive away). as i walk down the street, i notice it's the same one as my previous bonk. my heart sank when i watched this lovely girl turn to face me, say "this is me! ü•∞" while gesturing to the same door that i went through for a cheap one night stand. i suddenly see the resemblence. quickly i compliment her house and ask her how long she had lived there, grasping at some flimsy straws. "my whole life pretty much. just my parents, lil' sister and the dog ü§óü§óü§ó" she replies. everyone was home. i knew this. i had to tell her. she was shocked. very shocked when she realised that i wasn't joking when i got her mum's name right. i knew she was level-headed from our first few dates so thankfully she actually understood and didn't attack me for it. we do agree we can't keep seeing eachother (duh) but i really did like her, which can be rare for me, so it fucking sucks. she didn't mention her parents marriage and i don't want to ask. i also don't know how the house was free a couple of months ago. all i know is i fucked up. tldr; slept with older woman at her house. girlfriend-to-be invites me in the very same house. i realize my last lover was her mother. i tell her; no more gf2b.	0

(in no way, shape or form is his name leo by the way.) at this point, i've been playing the tinder game for a few months. i had recently broke up with my abusive boyfriend of nearly 2 years so i wanted to just get back up on my feet and to meet new people i guess lol. anyways, leo and i have been talking for about a week. he is in the military. which i was hesitant on meeting because my ex was in the military as well, and let's just say, we did not get along well. but he was nice enough, we had good-moderate conversation, at least through text. we talked about some really stupid shit that made him interesting enough to engage him in banter. we talked about the places he travelled to and what we liked to do for fun. i responded with the typical shit people like to do; eat, mukbangs, watch movies, hiking, gym, amusement parks etc... he mentioned that he loved rollercoasters and he bet i couldn't handle it. but, in fact, i love rollercoasters~ i mentioned that six flags was my favorite amusement park because i feel like no other park can satisfy my thrill seeking needs. then he proceeds to offer to take me out on an amusement park date! i actually scoffed irl when i read this because that's really expensive especially for a first date! (although, plenty of other guys have spent more on me on a first date before, but that's another storytime for another day üòùüëå) i replied that i had to decline because "i am a poor ass college student lol" and he proceeded to tell me no, he would pay for it and not to worry about the price. i thought, wow what a nice dude! plus, who could turn down a free all expense paid trip to six flags magic mountain?! is you crazy?! so, i immediately jumping on his offer and i said yes without thinking. jump in time, it's a week later. i've been thinking the whole week about the date because i'm fucking nervous. i have legit never been on a date where i'm stuck in a scenario where i am forced to get to know some one in an amusement park setting. that shit is fucking scary when you think about it. what kept running through my head that whole week were scenarios of what-ifs. what if leo was a serial killer. six flags is far from me, and i would be stuck in the car with him and i suck at directions so he could be driving me off to timbuktru and i wouldn't even know it!üëÄ what if we just don't get along irl and it would be an awkward 5-6 hrs because it would be a waste if we just went back home as soon as we got there? what if he was some stalker that would creep on me forever because he knows where i live?? so long story short, i had my doubts. at this point of the summer, my homie and i hung out and smoked and worked out practically everyday. this particular day was a day before the said date. my homie and i were really close and we always shared the tea on our tinder dates to each other all the time. i kept telling my homie how nervous i was for tomorrow's date and he suggested that i should take a dab and let my worries fade away~ naturally, i agreed and i took the fattest dab. one that just let's you ride waves? ya know? ... one moment you're watching a movie, chillin', and smokin pot with your homie the next you're waking up late af around noon and mind you, leo and i haven't set a time yet. leo texting you to give him the address to my place so he can tell me the eta of when he could get to me. i apologised and explained how accidentally woke up late and that if he was on his way, to take his time because i was going to take a while to get ready. he was very nice about it and was adamant on taking me out because he had already bought the tickets. he also apparently made some bomb ass cookies and he wanted to give me some from his coworker party or something(?) (and before people chime in on the sketch alert thing, he did send me pics of his homies and shit i trust him enough to consider going on a date with him at this time. anyways, it was already a damper when we couldn't get a head start on our day, but also that i had to get ready and go back to my place for him to pick me up for our date. i wasn't about to ask him to come pick me up at my homie's place that would he too far and awkward. but as it got later in the day, (leo was driving from norcal and he was coming down to see family down here in socal that it wasn't a big deal. i ended up smoking way too much when yes, i should have been on the road at this point heading back to my place. but, i was just sooooo fucking lazy at this point, that i didn't even want to get out of bed ;; 1 hour later, he texts me, hey are you ready? i'm at the starbucks next to yours" fuck. i have wasted the day away. and he's already there waiting for me and i am still 30 minutes away. i didn't expect the weed to kick in so hard that i completely lost track of time. i couldn't even think of a bullshit excuse, i didn't have the heart to tell him so..... i just panicked and ghosted him... üôÉüòÖ (i know, shame on me;; i was repaid tenfold with other tinder horror stories so karma definitely caught up with me) p.s. to the nice gentleman out there who i have wasted their time and money, i deeply apologize. üò¢üòì i hope you had nice dates there forth!~ tl : dr basically, i didn't mean to turn down a potentially nice tinder date to six flags because i had my doubts, and the guy already made it basically to my doorstep but i wasn't even at home because i was kickin' it with my homie smoking weed and i lost track of time. instead of responding like a decent human should, i acted kinda shitty and ghosted him üëÄüò∞ i really hope he can forgive me or he gets to go on that really cool amusement park date with a super cool gal üòä	0

how i lost a friend back in high school i pretty much only had one friend. he was kinda uhh.. "dumb" but was a good person. he was also so religious. when high school ended we kinda stopped talking until i reached out to him and yeah.. so in between high school and college i actually "discovered" i was bisexual so yeah last time we spoke we had plans to hang out the next next day and then i was like "alright bye" he was like "bye" and i was like "btw i'm bisexual " he was like "are you really?" and i was like "yeah" and he was like "i didn't expect that" and i was like "yeahhh about that.. it's a long story" and he was like "i bet it is" so yeah never heard from him again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is alright tho i already knew it would happen since he was so religious but yeah that's the story of how i lost a friend	0

i need your thoughts on this. m(22) i've been together with a girl since start of november. it was a good friend of my and a fellow student. i'm m(22) she is f(21). the first two weeks was amazing but soon she closed down. neglected the relationship and went cold towards me. it continued until january 21st where we had exam for the semester. once that was over i told her of my frustrations with how i felt neglected and that i didn't feel like there was a relationship. i explained that things had to change, she had to put in an effort and intiative. as well as decide if the relationship meant something to her. if she wanted to pursue it. now a month later i'm confronting her tomorrow. she has not started to take iniative or interrest in what makes me feel loved and cared for. and she still doesn't want me to meet her parents. tomorrow i'll ask her if she wants to be with me. both emotionally and physically. and if she doesn't wanna open up and let me be part of her life outside when we are alone at her place. then i feel i have no choice but to breakup. because since november this relationship has caused me much pain, frustration and time. and i feel lonely and used. üòî reddit i hope you can give me your constructive opinions as jodel is a cancer bin. tl;dr my girlfriend bassicly haven't taken initative or interrest in me or our relationship for 4 months and i'm breaking up tomorrow most likely. do you think that's justified?	0

my bff(13m) is dating my friend b(13m) but when i(13f) try to hug or even get close to bff, b pushes me away. am i being clingy? so, 5 months ago, bff started dating b. i supported their realationship because this was bff'a first real realationship and plus, they are cute together! so, i like to hug, put my chin on his shoulder and other things to bff as if he were a puppy. before bff started dating b, bff would let me do those things but now, b pushes me away. one time, i was hugging bff and b pushes me away from bff. i was upset and shocked at this. i was about to cry about what b just did. i left to go to my next period early. bff asked if i was okay in our last period, art and it went like this. bff: hey, are you okay? you seemed upset at lunch op: yeah, sorry. it's not your fault. i just got upset that b pushed me away. bff: omg i'm sorry about that. he is a bit protective ever since you made that joke! i made a joke that if b ever broke up with bff, i would steal bff. i'm a lesbian so that wouldn't even work out but i guess b took it seriously. now, please understand, b is a good friend. he's funny, kind and kinda stupid but that's most of our friend group anyway. but when bff is involved, he get protective. once, he's pinched me for hugging bff, and twice he flicked me in the head for the same reason! i would pinch or flick him back. i also, want you to understand is that o have a fear of being forgotten/abandoned/betrayed/having fake friends. i'm not trying to guilt trip you guys but i was bullied most of my life for being boyish and it messed me up. i was self conscious, low confidence and thought badly about myself. basically, i most likely have depression. i haven't been diagnosed but for 5 years, i've always had a lump of sadness in me. if i'm upset at myself. i call myself all sorts of terrible names. i dated a girl for a while and my mom realised that i got more confident since i started dating her but we broke up quite a while ago. idc about her anymore but since what b has been doing to me makes me really upset. i do get bored when none of my friends are around, especially bff. b does get in the way sometimes. whenever me and bff are together and b comes, he takes away bff. i'm scared i might lose b as a friend or even worse, i'll lose bff. b is a good friend and all but his actions really hurt me. bff has even talked to b about it before yet he still does it. im glad it's summer so i don't have to chat with him much. am i being clingy or obsessive with bff? i'm just terrified of losing anyoneclose to me. bff is the absolute best friend you can wish for but one day, i feel like b will take and/or convince bff to get away from me. feel free to comment anything that might help. i won't take offense to anything but if you have something rude to say, keep it to yourself. sorry if this a bit long. i gotta get ready for bed now. goodnight!üñêÔ∏è tl;dr: b pushes me away when i show affection to bff and i get upset.	0

while at a doctors/clinic tifu badly! back story, i'm on a clinical trial for a medical treatment which involves the taking of blood every month, receiving a couple of injections every month and having a through medical including an ecg every 3 months. today was my 3mth medical which includes fasting. i've been on the trial for a little over 2yrs. today, i turned up for my appointment which was scheduled at almost lunchtime which meant that i was already a little bit light headed (been fasting since 7pm the night before) and started to go through the process of being checked out. today the nurse and trial doctor (both females) were in a particular joking mood which made stripping down to my jocks a little less uncomfortable. after going through all the necessary medical checks (don't forget this is a medical trial) it was time for me to get up on the table for the ecg. once all the sticky sensor pads are put on my legs/wrists/and chest the nurse drops all the cords on my stomach to start sorting out what went where, and the leads seemed to all be dragged over my crotch. when everything was attached, the nurse then plugged it all into the main monitor/box and dropped it all onto mr wobbly. then she stood there using my leg like a bar leaner and chatted to the doctor. meanwhile i have to lie there perfectly still for a positive reading still feeling lightheaded. then something funny was said the nurse laughed and i will swear to the day i die ... her hand brushed my inner thigh. cue mr wobbly to pop up and have a look around ... bastard!! the ecg slid off my crotch and the nurse managed to catch it before it hit the floor. it completed its scan and while they uploaded my results i got my jabs and was allowed to get dressed in silence. everything was fine and we made a date and time for my next appointment. as i left and walked out i closed the door but through the walls i heard the doctor say to the nurse "at least we can rule out impotence as a side affect". and with the laughter still ringing in my ears i slunk out. tl; dr went to see a female doctor and nurse. cracked a fat one in front of them. despite what you see on reddit/pornvids we did not get it on üò≠	0

how should i [17m] tell my, recently 'long' distanced, close friend that i have feelings for her [17f] alright so this might end up long winded and verbose in an attempt to accurately describe the situation and how i feel... so i've known this girl for a while (about 4ish, 5ish, 6ish?, years). we recently started geting closer as friends these past few years and even closer these past few months... like pretty close... i've always had some sort of 'more than friends' feeling for her. didn't act on it because i was pretty young. then got older and had already started seeing this other girl (earlier 2018)... that ended pretty bad for me (story for another time i guess). fast foward... she starts appearing more frequently in my life... coincidence? it wasn't really until october 2018 (almost four months ago) that i really felt it... and it only grew from there... i found out around october that they (as in her and her family) were moving away mid december (3-4 hours away)... november hit, i realized i need to act fast... we connected a bunch, played some music together (pretty darn cute if i do say so myself), started texting a bunch (lots of feels, "üòâ", "üòä", "üòÅ", "üòÜ", "üòÇ", "üòÖ"). then late november early december things complicate and they end up leaving early, leaving some unfinished things here. i came up with a really great, sensitive, emotional, thoughtful gift to show her how i felt. it was a book she wanted 'five feet apart'.... fitting right? i had printed some pictures of us, wrote a bunch of notes on the back of each one, and hid them between the pages. i also came up with something pretty darn cute to write inside the cover "distance is not measured in miles, but affection. no distance is too far, and no time too long. distance gives us all the more reason right? there are some bonds no distance can break, i hope ours never will :)" (and something on the back). pretty dang slick no? on some of the notes i had brought up the idea of us going out and kinda conveyed how i felt, but at the same time not (not straight up, flat out)... if that makes any sense... point is if anything was gonna "make her fall for me" this would. she came back (after they had worked out the hiccups) a few times to finish up somethings here... i should mention that most of the time we hang out is with her and her older sister, me and my older sister and a few other people... but this last time only she came back. she texted only me, around 8ish, that she was in town. i had eagerly asked if she wanted to do something. we talked about going out (what seemed to me, just us two, a "date")... i was so nervous i was texting a friend for help and suggestions... everything was closed so she eagerly suggested a movie at her house... and i couldn't tell if she was meaning just me or my sister as well. it kinda seemed that way, but i didn't want to ruin anything had she wanted a specific way... so i invite my sister (to the enragement of my other friend) and we watch a movie at her house. it was then i gave her that gift. fast forward a little while, she opens it, says it was the most thoughtful thing... not exactly what i hoped she would say... fast forward a day or two, she tells me how much she enjoys me and compared me to chocolate. cute right?... fast forward a day or two, she tells me about how, in the book, the girl finds a really cute creative way to ask the guy out. and how she wished she was able to do something like that. to which i replied with how i wished i was able to do that. she then tells me that "idk i thought you had did a pretty great job with the book üòâ"... the next day she talks about the end of the book and tells me shes excited for the movie. i said that i didnt know if i would enjoy the movie based off how the book ended. and said that there was really one way for me to find out... she then suggested either reading the book or watching the movie both of which she wanted me to do with her "üòâ"... tl;dr: so here i am now 3:14 a.m. seeking the help of random strangers... after a bunch of somewhat hinting texts and encounters, and mixed emotions and signs... i mentioned in my story above some big things that i thought might be signs, but i am terrible at picking up hints... especially after what my last experience was :/. i know we're young, but i could wait (but for that i need to know how she feels)... we're almost out of high school and this is something i want in life... i think it's somthing i should pursue... but i don't want to ruin anything. should i tell her? should i wait a little while? p.s. i'm hoping maybe i could tell her face to face if i'm able to see her again soon (alone)... maybe at the movie she wanted to watch with me?...	0
i like people who tell me they will get better than me at something. so juts as the title says. i like it when someone tells me (mostly it's someone from my friend circle) that they will get better than me. i feel really proud and happy that i have inspired them to do better and that they have me as their benchmark. like for example, a friend of mine recently started going to the gym with me and he is a bit on the healthy side and can't always keep up with the high intensity exercise i do. but he mentioned a few days back that he might not match my stamina yet but he will get there and eventually even get better than me! i was so proud of him. to me it meant that he is willing to put in as much if not more effort to better himself and that he thinks that i am worthy. i was deeply humbled. it also motivated me to push harder and be a better benchmark for him to overcome. that's it, i wanted to share that with you guys! have a good day üòÅ	0

need help with reply to mom's ideations i had to call the police on her last night. her boyfriend notified me that she was about to drink some fatal concoction. i was out of town, thank god, but stuck in the backseat of a car for two hours. they got to her before she did anything. i think i want to start out by thanking her for her honesty, and that she wants to get help. other than that i just feel lost. she has hurt me emotionally many times growing up, but since i left home she's changed for the better. background: she was sexually assaulted by a sibling as a child and the whole thing was covered up by her family, was a victim of two other sexual assault incidents, and raised multiple children on her own after my dad died of an overdose. i'm the oldest and i was almost three when that happened. she's definitely shouldered so much trauma. üòî her message to me: "i am very sorry you were involved at all. in either situation. the truth is that i have not been well for a very long time. each day is riddled with thoughts of death and hopelessness. i have not wanted to burden you with this, but in response to your email i will be completely honest. i have a deep desire to die. everyday. i have multiple plans of ways to die that ensures no one i love finds me and also allows ya'll to get my life insurance. at any given moment of any given day i am moments away from ending my life. i am very sorry to hurt you. that is the last thing i want. you, [sibling], and [sibling] are the only reasons i don't follow through. it sickens me to think of the aftermath ya'll would be left with, so i trudge on trying to find moments of peace and joy. i'm so tired. i'm so weary. i beg god to take me. i am not trying to be dramatic, i just really want it all to be over. this is why i am getting help. the times i have said out loud that i am going to do harm to myself have not been empty threats, i have simply been able to stop myself. if things don't change soon, i will not be able to stop myself. i would never want to cause you pain, but i know it seems to be all i am capable of. i have let you down so many times. please forgive me. please know i am trying so hard to get help and to get better. i am sorry."	1

is there still a chance for me (f 21) with my ex(24 m) i miss my ex so much. i'm 21, my ex is 24. we dated for 3 years, and he was there all throughout my freshmen year of college and we would facetime audio all night, every single night falling asleep to each other. it was long distant relationship, but later down the road, i ended up dropping him for another guy that i've met. but after dating that guy and another guy, i realized that i missed my first ex, and loved him the most out of all the guys i dated, and missed what we had the most. but the thing is that i hurt him immensely, and put him through a lot of pain when i ignored him those times he kept trying to chase after me. i feel so shitty about all the things i did in the past. he cried countless times trying to reach out to me, but i refused to listen to him, and kept on ignoring him. now i regret it immensely. because i contacted him a while ago to wish him happy birthday, and found out he has a girlfriend now ( that lasted less than a month), and said that she's very special and that he loves her a lot. i'm happy that he found someone, but also extremely sad that him and i will never be again. i had so many amazing memories with this man, and knowing that they came to a halt is soul wrenching. it's been 12 days since the no contact period has started, and i'm struggling to get him off my mind. i mean, i do go out and do things, but my mind keeps coming back to him from time to time. i can't help if but want to do everything in my power to get him back. please help, i have horrible self restraint, and i fear that i might do something incredibly stupid like drive all the way to his house (5 hrs away) and bring i'm sorry posters and millions of teddy bears. i mean, i would totally do it but there's absolutely zero chance now since he has a girlfriend now! üò¢ tldr: is there a chance for my ex to get back with me even though he has a girlfriend now ( they've been together for a month now).	0
compliment üòä a few minutes ago, i was just complimented on my voice, which is something no one has ever complimented me for. it made me feel happy. she said i sound like holly hunter and that she loves holly hunter. i've never watched much tv or that many movies so i have no idea what holly sounds like, so i guess i have to watch the incredibles now. üòäüòäüòä	0

an open world animal game idea i thought of sorry it's not organize but ima do it soon...i jus wanted to hurry and get it all out make a singleplayer and multiplayer and online open world animal game with realistic graphic and animation and animals like cats, rabbits, dogs, squirrels, raccoons, hedgehogs, foxes, weasels, owls, hawks, mice, badgers, wolves, seagulls and etc and maybe...if u can...make it so you can create your own map by addin trees and plants and grass and rocks and rivers and lakes and ponds and neighborhoods and cities and mountains and hills...but make the map big as hell and have different biome area like forest and open moors, city, towns, and neighborhoods, snowy mountain and a snowy area and snow forest and hills and stuff, and basically thats it....but have the map be big and maybe 2 cities and couple different forest areas and snowy areas, with rivers and lakes and dens, burrows, caves, nests for the animals...and maybe make it so when ur a dog or cat u can go to da neighborhoods and get an owner if u make one of the humans like u and sum of the humans will have family so u can be in a family home or they just be a couple wit no kids or just one person and they feed u food and water in bowls and it never gets empty and u can go out da cat flap on da door and maybe a dog flap for da dogs or u jus bark at da door and the owner comes and u can go out an open window if ur a cat and if its a high window near a tree u can jump to da tree and climb down and cats and squirrels can be able to climb trees and sum of the animals can dig, swim and stuff and mate and have babies(and u can choose if u want 1-6 to be born) and u can carry them depending what animal u are and rabbits can go on the farm and steal crops to eat like carrots and carry them back and u can switch from different members of ur pack/group/family and make them grab and carry something and then switch back to ur main animal and they'll follow u still carrying whatever they had and u can command them to stay somewhere or follow or patrol and area for danger or food...and have the seasons change whenever u want them to instead of them changing naturally u can just change it urself...like maybe hold the big middle button and an interaction menu pops up like in gta5 director mode and u can change a lot of the stuff from there like the name of ur members ur animal and the time of day and season and weather and how the moon looks and where it'll be in the sky also where the sun will be at and the snow won't build up like gta5 online on christmas... it'll just be snow on the ground as soon as u make it winter and u can make it snow or not snow or a blizzard and u can hunt for prey and also catch fish and find nuts and plants to eat and even out the trash in the alley or snatch food from people or sneak into fast food places or eat at ur owner's house and in the fall season the leaves would be falling but the leaves in trees would stay in the trees but it'll be 3 or 6 leaves falling from the trees and there will be leaves on the ground and sum of the trees would have red, yellow, or orange leaves and people would be rakin leaves into piles in their yards and in winter sum of the trees would have no leaves and in spring a lot more flowers would be around and stuff and it'll rain more but u can also make the rain stop...and maybe u can run by holdin r2 and jump by pressin x and eat by holdin o circle only when ur near food and make the animal noise by pressin down on r3 like gta5 and fight by pressin square and catch fishes by pressin square and carry stuff by holdin triangle and be able to go in first person mode maybe? and be able to look all around and up at the sky with the camera...cuz u cant do it in gta5 as a animal which is dumb üòë and be able to leap and sit on walls and tree branchs if ur a cat and a animal that can do that...and fly around and snatch small animals up if ur a hawk or owl by pressin square when ur flyin near a small animal and be able to sit by pressin down on l3 once and to lay by pressin it again and sleep by pressin it again and when u press it again you stand up and maybe...if u make it online...make it so atleast 20 - 30 people to a world or more if u can and make it so u can go to the menu when u press the option button u can see the whole map in color in good detail as if it was a picture from above the map...kinda like the gta5 interactive map is and make it so u can create a online server(but call them "worlds" in the game) and name them and put info to what is going on...like if its a roleplay or play as specific animal world and you can see all the players who are in the world before u join and u can choose which one u wanna go to unlike gta5 where it puts u in whatever it wants and also make it so u can switch animals using the interaction menu "holdin the big middle button" and switch animals and it'll be a light around the player and it'll switch the animal or make it so it just fades into that animal but if ya cant do dat then do whatever but dont make the whole screen go black then it come back and ur another animal and none of the animals need to be unlocked and there wont be no missions..just and open world survival game...you will have unlimited sprint but need to eat and drink or your health will go down if either of the food or water bars are empty and when u die u respawn at whatever spawn point u are closer to and it'll be 10 spawn points bc the map will be big and the area surrounding the map would be mountains and u wont be able to go pass them bc an invisible barrier will stop u like most games...and the neighborhood and city and town areas wouldnt be at the edges of the map bc the mountains would be there and maybe add a urban area near the bottom of map and one at the top in the snowy area and add train tracks that go around the map to both the cities and add abandoned houses that animals can go in and also add a text chat and voice chat but make the voice chat like u have to choose from some voices you want other people to hear and u can change it in the interaction menu and u can make it so nothing is on the screen like no huds and stuff and the map wont be on the screen it will only be on the menu when u press options and u can set waypoints but have to keep goin back to map to look at it and also make it so u can choose from 3 different sound distances and when ur changing it it'll be a circle around ur animal showin how far its gonna be so anyone in that circle will be able to hear u so if u only want the people right next to u to hear u bc ya might be sneakin up on people that'll be sound distance 1 and it'll be the smallest and 2 it will be so like anyone in the area ur at can hear u so like if ur at a river and ur on one side the person across from u on the other side can hear u too but in number 1 only the person right next to u or in front of u can hear u and number 3 will be the largest and anyone around u on the map can hear u but not the whole world can hear u and also u can choose who u want to hear u so only that person or those people can hear u...like a private chat and they can be close to u or on the other side of map and add a couple barns and farms and rivers and streams and stuff like that and maybe add places that'll be known like a huge tree called the great tree or a river called the blue and have places like these name marked on the map and make these spawn points where they can fast teleport to and maybe an abandoned house can be a spawn point and the respawn points won't be the same as the fast travel spawn points...so only when u die u go to a nearby respawn point and...back to the digging....u can dig holes to live in and make burrows or add more burrows to an existing one...and only certain animals can dig a hole or burrow to live whilst the fox, dog and cat and other animals like them can only dig small holes just to put sum food they caught in or something they grabbed and it'll be marked on the map where they made a hole so they can go back to it...and thats all ima type up...and if u cant make the game...atleast show someone this and give them the idea and put it into consideration...and im 16 and don't kno how to make games (i sent this to rockstar and copied and pasted it here) a lot of us like being animals and roleplaying our fandoms like warrior cats, watershipdown, animals of farthing wood, survivors and other animal fandoms in a game	0

tifu: by creeping out my ex girlfriend this fuck up occured around 3-4 in the morning after a night of drinking. pardon the formatting i'm on mobile and very hungover. backstory: so about 4-5 years ago i dated this girl (let's call her summer) for about 9-10 months. we attended university together and met when i was a freshman and she was a junior. she was my first serious girlfriend and was the first person i ever said "i love you" to. the relationship seemed to work well but eventually she broke up with me for reasons i'm still not 100% clear on. admittedly, i was pretty broken up about it for a while but eventually i moved on and started dating again. it's been a few years since we've spoken to each other, but at least on my end there are no hard feelings. now after dating around and going through a few failed relationships since, recently i have started to see this girl (we'll call her autumn) and things are going well. she is an extremely charming, kind, charismatic, and beautiful person who i am trying really hard not to fuck things up with. the fuck up: last night around midnight, my friend (we'll call him tyson) calls me and tells me that we're going out drinking. i'm already on the verge of going to sleep and really not in the mood but then i figure eh it's a friday night, might as well try and have some fun. for some reason i decide that since i'm going out so late my only option to catch up is to drink copious amounts of whiskey. within the time it took me to get dressed and get out the door (about a half hour) i manage to get down just under a half of a fifth if jack daniel's. not the best idea i've ever had considering my once impressive alcohol tolerance has dwindled to that of a middle schooler. by the time i got to the bar i was already regretting my decisions, but it was too late to turn back. after sitting with a beer for a few minutes, tyson walks in with some people i have never met, (nor do i remember them this morning) and starts ordering shots of tequila for everyone. i partake in the festivities for another hour or so and get truly drunk. at this point who should walk in but autumn. i casually go over to her and manage to string together enough words to form coherent speech. after about 30 minutes of us sharing a playful banter she says that she is tired and starts to go home. we kiss goodbye and she turns to leave but as i go back to my friend she stops me and says "actually i was hoping to ask you why you don't text me that often?" i go on to try and explain that i just really dislike texting (i feel as though i lose all of my charm through texts and that it has a negative impact on my relationships), however in my drunken state it really sounds like more of an excuse. she looked slightly upset at this and just said "okay" before leaving. making me feeling like a huge ass. i return to the bar and continue drinking for a while before tyson and i are booted out after last call. tyson and i begin our walk towards our homes (we live in the same neighborhood) when i tell him about what happened with autumn. he tells me that i'm just being paranoid and that there is nothing wrong with texting, but in an effort to prove my point i mention that my poor texting skills contributed to my inability to maintain a relationship with summer. he says that i am full of shit so i proceed to pull out my phone and go through our facebook messages from when we were together. we go through and laugh at a few of the dumb things i try to talk about over texts and then start talking about other things. by the time i get home it is around 3:30-4 in the morning and i am very very drunk. as i stared up at my ceiling i started to think back to autumn and how i might've hurt her feelings, so i decide to shoot her a facebook message. as i open my phone i come across the 4-5 year old convo between my ex and myself and find that on many of her messages i have left a "reaction" for those of you that don't know (as i only found out last night) if you hold your finger onto a message on the messenger app it brings up a little display showing the different emoji reactions you can have to said messages. one of these stupid things is a smiley face with hearts for eyes somewhat resembling this "üòç". somehow as i had scrolled through the messages i had left roughly a dozen of these fuckers throughout the convo. i panicked and removed them as soon as i found them. i scrolled through several more times and found no trace of the little bastards, so i proceeded to go to bed assuming the situation was rectified. cue to this morning and i go to ensure that everything is fine when i find that summer has removed me from social media. i can only imagine the cringe she must of had when she saw that an ex from college did something like that. tl;dr: accidently left a bunch of bizarre emojis in a four year old conversation with an ex, she got creeped out and removed me from social media	0
tonight, i witnessed a nasty crash after a guy ran a red light. i stayed with him for almost two hours after and gave him a hug before i left. so, i was on my way home after a boring night at work staring into space doing security bullshit. typical night, nothing interesting ado, et cetera. i was on the last leg of my commute, just 5 miles away from my apartment when i was pulling up to the light at a major intersection. about a hundred feet from the stop line, a guy in a white honda accord sped up towards the light, accelerating towards a line of stopped cars. my thought process was about as follows: *car speeds past* "uhh... you can't be this dumb, there's a red light there." *car dives into right turn lane to barrel past the stopped cars* "well. proved me wrong, i guess. this is gonna be a special kind of dumb." *car speeds into intersection, cuts back across the traffic that's currently taking left turn into main road. predictably slams into a car, just barely managing to not jump the median into oncoming traffic after bashing one car really hard in the left rear corner.* "*sighs* mother. fuck." so, though i just got off work from my security guard gig, my feet hurt and i was kinda hungry, i take it upon myself to do the good samaritan thing and pull off to the side of the road and see if anyone was hurt. the car that was hit turned out to be a lincoln town car. late-mid 2000s model, built like a fucking house. thing lost a taillight, basically, but everyone inside was fine. at least, fine enough. i dialed 911 as soon as i saw that the three occupants inside the victim's car were alright. gave them the where and how, who was involved and how many people, all that jazz. they said they were on their way. then the call ended. the driver of the accord comes up and starts asking if they're alright in there. seems kinda distant, nothing bad enough to make me think he's intoxicated. most likely a little jolted from the crash, i figured. i made a mental note of the guy's appearance and got back to watching everything. ems made it there in less than 10 minutes. during that time, another person stopped to be a witness, which gave me someone to sit and talk to while we waited. after they got there, they started their way over to the accord while a team worked on 'extracting' the people in the lincoln (they were all fairly big folks, so they had to be slow with it). while this happened, i looked around, and saw that they were putting crime scene tape around the completely wrecked accord. this confused me, but when a car drove past the crash, i saw that there was nobody in the car. dude flat out ran for it, it looked like. ems had two of the victims packed away and were working on pulling out the last one, then out of the corner of my eye, i see a guy that looks exactly like the driver of the honda, minus a hat, walking over to the crash. it was him, it turned out. at first, i was kinda cold to him, i admit. i didn't know what the hell he was thinking, trying to run a red light on one of the busiest intersections within several miles, but here he was, back at the scene and visibly upset. guy started making excuses and trying to justify everything that happened, blaming his girlfriend, blaming his car, blaming the other *driver* at one point. the other witness and i stood there and just talked with the guy while he went through all the stages of grief in front of us. then after a while, he just starts sobbing, right there on the side of the road. he's devastated, he thinks he's possibly seriously hurt or killed someone, and the fear and regret in his voice are very, very real. so here i am, going from "this guy's an asshole with no regard for anyone but himself." to "geez. this guy fucked up and he knows it. poor bastard." in a short enough span that i'm about to get whiplash, myself. so, ems leaves, and myself, the second witness, the driver and the driver's girlfriend stay at the crash scene waiting for the police to show up. and all the while, we're just sitting there and talking like normal human beings. the fact we were complete strangers in a rough part of town, that one of us had caused a nasty accident a short while ago, that one of us was fresh out of work while another was late to work because of the crash, none of it mattered. we just sat there and talked like friends. it was totally fucking surreal. so all the while, we're talking to the driver, telling him that everything was going to be okay, that the insurance policies would cover the crash itself, and the medical bills of the driver and passengers of the other car. we talked of our own tragedies and mishaps, about the shit we'd seen and the way it all worked out in the end. about the people we'd unintentionally hurt and the ways we atoned for it, and that, even in the worst of cases, we humans are quite resilient and have a natural talent for recovering from the daily calamities that befall us. the second witness had to run to work, so i sat with the driver while we waited for the police. from the point of impact, it was an entire two hours before an officer arrived to take a statement. and the entire time i was with the driver, it was just straight up pleasant. eventually the police finally showed in the form of a single highway patrol officer. they must have been really slammed tonight, to take two hours to get there, but i digress. i gave my statement without any real event, and the guy went to his car to get his id and such out of it. after i gave my statement, id and number, as well as the other witness' information, i was free to go. i walked over to the driver after, and i gave him a big hug and told him that everything was going to be alright. gave him my number and told him i'd buy him a coffee sometime, then got back on the road and went home. i got home late, but despite the annoyance, i'd say it was worth the fuss. now, back to the internet and drowning myself in video games with my long distance girlfriend. thanks for reading, ya bastards! ‚ô•Ô∏è	0

my last thoughts.. i wanted to come on here and tell my story, of when it was the beginning of the end. when i was a baby, i was rapped by a family member. i don't really remember what and how it happened but i was told later on in life, when i was about 4/5 i was rapped by different family member. and this time i did remember but wasn't sure if it was a dream or something that actually occurred, which just about 2 years ago was confirmed it was real. when i was in 4th grade i was sexually assaulted by a different person, and then my dad was murdered. which took me into a great depression because he was all i had, after his death in 2010, i was rapped again by yet another person from 6th grade up until 8th grade. and if that didn't seem like enough my freshman year it happened for the last time.. so i been rapped and sexually assaulted my entire life , from different people. and i know it's sounds very dumb to say but it felt kinda normal.. like if this happened to everybody, until i was asked about it at school because a counselor noticed some red flags, i told them who it was at the moment and that person is currently in jail. and because he was a family member, my mom hated me for it. she treated me like shit and proceed to make me feel like it was all my fault and that i was in the wrong. i started looking for alternatives to escape my reality and started doing drugs , and running away.. typical teenage things. but i ended up pregnant. at 15. my mom kicked me out and the father of my child took me in.. he cheated on me my whole pregnancy, but i had no where to go. so i forgave him, and he has cheated on me the whole 5 years we have been together if i'm being honest, but i stayed. i didn't finish school, it's quite difficult to find a job and i stay home and watch the kid, clean and cook ect. a couple of months back we talked it out and he said it would be his last time cheating and i believed him.. on friday, i had a mental breakdown, i cried and cried and cried for hours about how much i hate my life and how bad i wanted to end it , because i have no family, no friends and i can't stop reliving my past, i'm still heart broken about my dads death and to top it off i'm constantly worried about him cheating on me and he hugged me calmed me down , and did everything he was suppose to do to and reassured me that i have him and that's all that should matter, "our little family" yesterday night, he fell asleep with him phone on, and i felt like i had all the right to look threw it.. and he was indeed still cheating, not with 1, not 2, not even with 3 but 5 females.. üíî and i've haven't stopped crying since.. idk what to do anymore. after he sat there and watched me cry for hourssss he look me straight in my face and lied. and now i'm on the edge, all i was fighting for was "us" and i didn't even have that.. these are my last thoughts. and i can't wait to end the torture that is my life once and for all	1
heroinsweet warm decadence ‚ù§Ô∏è after trying it a few times i've found my new love. it's better than most anything i've ever tried, and that includes loving humans. it's kind of like life and death in one needle. life because it helps my day go by without boredom and sadness. death because if things get too shitty i just have to use too much and maybe mix it with some other fun pills. thank you.	1
am i in the wrong? m/22 and f/25 fwb for 6 months hello everybody, so a year ago i met this girl through a friend. we spend the whole summer with the three of us and i developed feelings for this girl which ended up in me telling her i was in love. she did not love me that way and that was the end of that. however, we ended up having some sort of fwb. we did not have actual sex yet. i consider this girl my best friend. two months into our fwb she distanced herself from me probably because of my feelings for her. i then kissed someone else while going out (she did not like it) and that was the end of our fwb for the time being. after a month we grew back together and the fwb continued. now i know she does not like me kissing someone and then coming back to her, i get that. i did that because i felt lonely anyway. the feeling of being hopelessly in love has gone but i still love her and if she's into it i would start a relationship as soon as possible and she knows that. i told her that i have to be open to other girls. (because i will get stuck otherwise) okay so now something happened and i'm not sure whether i am guilty of doing something bad and what to do now. a niece of mine hooked me up with a friend of hers and we had drinks with the three of us. a month later i send the girl in question a message. nothing happened and nothing will. my fwb saw a text from her and she knew about me meeting her. she went silent and i asked her what was wrong. she said that if i was serious about her i should end the fwb with her. i agreed and was planning to end it as soon as i saw potential. is that too late? she though so. she asked if i texted her first. i lied. that's on me. she asked if i had contact with her a few days after her reading the text. i lied. (only because i wanted to slowly let everything bleed out) so now everything is good again. i know more about how see sees our fwb and what see expects of me but i have lied about several things and feel bad about this. she puts honesty on a pedestal and the fact that i lied to her face does hurt me. why did i lie? because i knew that if i told her the truth our friendship as a whole would be in danger. she can react very strong to these things. i lied because i think this whole situation is not worth fighting over or losing our friendship (or fwb) over. our fwb mostly consist of handwork anyway. üòÖ there is a big chance that she will find out about this someday. most lies get found out. if this happens she will be very mad. i just don't think this whole situation is worth getting mad about. we're not exclusive (she doesn't want to, i do). and we do not even have sex. and she knows i have to be open to other girls. i recently also have asked another girl for her number which she does not know about. this is also something i feel guilty for not telling about. have i done something wrong? should i tell her i lied or just keep my mouth shut and consider this a necessary lie and learn from it? i'm just so confused... i have never even been in a real relationship. i have no idea. üòÇ tl;dr i am in a fwb situation with a girl i want to start a relationship with but she does not want a relationship so i keep my eyes open for a girl i can connect with and who does. my niece hooked me up with someone and my fwb found out and got mad. i then lied about several facts which i now feel guilty about. i never contacted the girl i got hooked up with again and am planning to just let things go and when i really want to find someone end things with my fwb. keep in mind that i really care for my fwb and that she cared about me too. you can call us best friends.	0

struggle due to german accent hey guys, i'm going to complete an internship in wapakoneta, ohio early 2017 so i just started to improve both my written and spoken english. but i'm pretty afraid of my german accent. when i speak with my german accent i can speak kinda fluently and find the right words but then i realize & try to imitate an american (? i don't even know if it's american, but i try to sound more english-y) accent and everything's messed up. what do you think about an (german) accent? i'm afraid i will not be taken serious and will sound unprofessional. on the other hand, my imitated accent might be worse... (maybe i can record a few sentences to illustrate my struggle üòÅ) aaaah, cheers alex edit: i am from germany (obviously üòÑ) and 22,m if it dies anything to my "question"	0
tifu by not using jack stands and having a car land on my chest and head. i'm by no means a mechanic. sometimes parts malfunction and as a member of the portion of society that lives paycheck to paycheck, sometimes you have to just figure it out. yesterday i was attempting to replace an ac compressor. i was using the scissor jack that comes with the car, a friend was helping. i knew to put the tire under the car at least, but i was just trying to reach a bolt real quick and forgot. he leaned into the car, i saw the car start to move. by the time i saw it, the entire weight of the car was sitting on my chest and head. it was a truly frightening 6 seconds. my friend tries to lift it, he relieved the pressure so that i could breath. i yelled for him to get it off and my girlfriend who had walked inside for a second came running over and helped. i was able to get out. thankfully i'm fine. a little beat up, but entirely whole. don't take shortcuts. you've got time to do it right. this could have all been easily avoided. another friend had a floor jack and jack stands they were going to let me use, but i didn't want to wait on them to get back home. it almost cost my life. edit: me stupid, no understand basic human knowledge. dad really wasn't around to teach me how to do things correctly. i try, sometimes fail catastrophically. ramps won't work. the tire had to be removed to access the compressor. also that bitch super icy now ü•∂	0
telling all of you this story right here (hello to my ex-boyfriend!) re-upload as my post is constantly being removed because my tl dr "wasn't descriptive enough" or something else... just let me tell my story, gosh darn it! so, my dear beloved internet, here is a story for you: my ex boyfriend and i went our seperate ways a while ago. he was the first real love of my life and, for years, made me believe that i was his too. after he decided to break it off with me, things started to get real wild. he used multiple methods, people, circumstances and my strong feelings for him to emotionally and physically abuse me to the point where i had serious suicidal thoughts and was diagnosed with severe post traumatic stress disorder. he had also left me at a time where i would have needed him more than anything. he made me go through hell. for the past months, he repeatedly told me, with full knowledge of what he could cause and that i was already struggling with depression and anxiety, that i was a burden to everyone in my life, that i was a worthless piece of shit, that he never loved me and i never meant anything to him. he told me that he used me because he didn't want to be alone. he thought it was hilarious, making jokes as he told me all these horrible things. repeatedly, i was stupid enough to listen to his sadism over the course of many months. and it didn't stop there. i was made to believe that i was ugly, appaling, not worthy anyones' love or friendship or affection. he made me believe that i didn't deserve to live. during all this, i was still naive and stupid enough to attempt to make peace with him and talk things out on countless occasions, which he only ever used to mistreat me more. a few days ago, just when i had finally, with the help of my family and friends, gathered the strength to walk away from him and accept that he would never change, he texted me. he told me that he'd tell my father about all the "illegal things" i had allegedly done, basically threatening me with the last thing he could use against me that he hadn't already used. my father and i are not on good terms and we hardly ever speak. still, i am financially dependent on him because i am still at university. however, i am not at all afraid of my father. on the contrary i was, despite everything he had done to me, concerned for my ex boyfriends' well-being ... my father is not the type of father anyone would want to be messing around with. despite everyone telling me to leave him to his fate, i still chose to contact him to ask him not to do it, explaining that he really shouldn't ever contact my father if he cared for his own life and health. and his answer to this act of basic decency is the whole reason i am now telling the whole community of reddit about this. the answer was [this picture](<url>), featuring him and one of his many, many girls. a written message was enclosed, containing the words "there's no place for you here. fuck off and take your brain farts somewhere else". despite the horribleness of situation i, of course, had to laugh at the word "farts". my ex-boyfriend takes a lot of pride in the number of girls he has been going through these past few months. i know that because he took pleasure in telling me about it. if what he told me is true, he's also currently with a girl whom he is allegedly in love with, just like he was in love with 9 other girls ( that i know of) that he said the same exact thing about, including myself. all of these girls, without exception, have been disappointed and had their hearts broken by him in various ways but none of them he ever tortured nearly as much as he tortured me. after he's sent me this little porn picture, i have finally decided not to be the victim of his games anymore. i've decided to walk away now, rebuild my self-worth and my mental health and realize that i am, and always will be, too good for a sadistic, inhumane egomaniac who will never again be capable of true love or happiness. right now, he is on his first vacation with his new playtoy. so, with this little story and with the knowledge that he is reading this i want to say the following: i wish you all the best on your vacation, baby! üì∑ tl;dr my ex-boyfriend and i broke up a while ago, after which he emotionally abused me for months. after i tried to help him, despite everything he had done to me, he chose to send me a picture of him and another girl in bed as a reply, now, i decided to walk away and tell my story right here, on reddit! and for clarification:. this is a fuck-up because it could very well lead to him trying to sue me :-d	0
for real though, why is arrested development so goddamn funny?? a partially rhetorical question perhaps, but thought maybe it would be fun to discuss. i've loved the show ever since it was first broadcast on fox. i bought all the seasons on dvd as soon as they came out. so i've watched every episode (of the original series) countless times over the last 16 years. i know every episode by heart. so you'd think that by now, it wouldn't seem as fresh and funny to me. but after deciding to rewatch all of them on a whim after not having watched them for a few years, it's still as if i'm watching it for the first time. there has never been another show that has me literally in tears from laughing so hard, and i love all the tv comedy greats like *seinfeld*, *the simpsons*, *30 rock*, *its always sunny*, etc etc. but ad is different. obviously you could boil it down to the writing and the talent of the actors. mitchell hurwitz and the other writers are literal geniuses. to be able to craft such clever jokes, gags, puns and scenarios and put it altogether into a coherent story and making it all relate takes otherworldly skills in my opinion. and the other ingredient is the talent of the actors. there isn't anyone on that show who wasn't superb in their roles. but what *about* the writing and acting makes it especially funny? is it that we all know people like that and so it's really relatable? is it that the things they say and do are all things we secretly think and feel? is it that we all subconsciously realize how stupid a lot of life is and we need comedy to validate that for us? maybe it's all of those things and more. or maybe i'm thinking too deeply about it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è	0

disrespecting the shortest woman i've ever seen, within 2 minutes. this happened last saturday and the cringe is still eating me up. i'll keep it short for you peeps. last saturday was kingsday in the netherlands. to sum it all up: everywhere you go there are kids selling shit and parties. my friends and i decided to go to a festival and join the party club. we arrive and sooner than later i lose my friends, as is tradition. i start texting my friends asking where they went, a bit of back and forth and i got their location. mission acquired. i notice i have to go past this big stage full with people to get to my friends. as i start my journey in to the abyss i walk past this very small woman. like, really really really small. not a midget! don't confuse her with one of them, i've seen my share of midgets and she definitely wasn't one. a woman, around 25/30 years old that seems to have just, shronken. she shrunk to the size of a 8 year old. i was blown away to say the least. the drugs and booze didn't help me either. seeing as i'm 6'11", the ratio between us was fucking insane. i could probably lift her up with 1 hand, no joking. kick her out of the festival ground as if she was a soccer ball. you get the idea. i start a conversation and straight up start talking about her height, in hindsight that was probably very rude and intimidating. while talking to her about her shortness and how blown away i was i notice i was getting weird looks from her friends. then it hit me. i was standing like [this](<url> -l-exterieur.jpg) while talking to her. most likely with a facial expression like [this](<url>) i stand up straight and apologize by blurring out: "owh shit. i, uuh, i shouldn't stand like that, huh?" shorty says yes, you shouldn't. i just straight up bounced after that. fuck. fast forward to a couple hours later i found my friends. we just chilling when 1 of the girls gets a few texts. she looks at her phone and asks me wtf i've done. shorty knows her, shorty saw her with me, shorty asks her why she standing with me. tl;dr i'm tall, met shortest woman i've ever seen. stood very disrespectfull infront of her. seriously, it isn't that long. gonna hide in my bed now :(	0

is this a relationship dealbreaker? my bf (30yo) offered his single female friend to come stay with us in his place "rent free" without consulting me first. i need help? (this is long, and ranty, and i am very sorry, but i need to know if my relationship is worth salvaging, at this point. i just need to gain different insight to see if i'm wasting my time with this guy, or if i am completely overreacting). so, i am in a bit of a relationship jam here and any input and feedback would honestly be much appreciated, because i am not thrilled at the idea of talking to my family about this, and i feel like dirty laundry is best aired with complete strangers (sounds odd, i know). after what has happened, i'm honestly starting to lose the attraction and respect for my boyfriend that i once had, and i want to see if i overreacted to this situation, or if this is bad enough to be a dealbreaker. he gave me no red flags leading up to this, and there are usually red flags in situations like this. so, backstory: my (30 yo bf) and i (27 yo female) have been happily dating exactly 1 year. happy, wonderful, and sometime last year, after we had been dating a few months, he decided he wanted to reconnect with his (sadly now deceased) male friend's girlfriend (who is single and dating, 34 yo; we'll call her betsy). he wanted to get back in touch with betsy to remember his friend who had died a few years back, so they could share awesome memories of him together, which i initially thought was amazing. but plainly put, betsy is causing a bit of a stir between he and i, and i didn't want to believe before that it was intentional on her part, but i have to trust my gut, and my b.s. meter is sadly on high alert with her, and i have every reason to feel like my bf should probably stay away from her, because its glaringly obvious that she is a bonafide crap-starter. she is allegedly a christian, however i didn't realize until last week when we hung out with her for the 3rd time, that she wears an overly zealous and insufferably imposing personality to go along with her faith- she never talks about other people's accomplishments, only herself, is very boastful about all the good deeds she's done, all the money she's donated and volunteering, and she doesnt seem to care to ask anyone about themselves and interrupts within seconds if she does, since she needs to be the only one talking; oh, and she also plainly states that she 'hates women' and thinks 'most women have evil, wicked hearts' - huge red flag #1, and i'll throw in a #2 as well. sl*t-shaming misogyny with a game wholesome smile on her face is her game, and nah, we're not in the 21st century with feminism and human rights or activism or anything.....üòÇüò§ so, 5 months ago was our 2nd time spending time with this (quite enigmatic) young lady. it was more pleasant hanging out with her the 2nd time, to say the very least. and this past weekend was the 3rd time my boyfriend and i had the wonderful privilege (sarcasm) of hanging out with her! so, backtrack to 5 months ago, i had clearly told him after we had hung out with her, that i didn't feel comfortable what she was texting him, because she was asking him if she could come over to his house and take care of him, and she was not asking about me or my whereabouts whatsoever (jn the text she sent him, she offered things like to bring him vitamins and make some soup). one of her later texts in that cringey conversation with him had just shown up on my boyfriend's phone at a time he and i were both looking at his phone, and he offered to show me what she had sent to him (i would never snoop - i trusted my bf at the time, and wouldn't snoop even now that i don't trust him as much). so after reading what this betsy lady wrote to my boyfriend, i kinda saw red for a moment, and just laughed and i thought 'what the actual f-' and i began to cringe-laugh, and then i felt fine once i read his response: he had politely rescinded her offer to come over to his house (i wasn't living with him, nor am i now, but my move-in with him has been in the works for about 4 months now and it's something we are definitely planning, we are very honest and open with each other in many ways, so we were confident that it will happen when it's meant to). after i had plainly told him that her text made me quite uncomfortable, he said 'yeah i had a feeling you wouldn't like what she said.' so i thought, and told him: 'well, babe, now that i think about it, she's christian, and i am too, and i realize i have to take that into account, so knowing that, i can say that what she said sits better with me, and i trust her, even though...what she said is still really inappropriate. i think she means well though, it's just...you and her just started hanging out again after not seeing each other or talking for 2 years....could she just respect what we have and wait til we (or you) can hang out with her somewhere in public? i would just like to get to know her more....' so, he said that he agreed and for her to come over when i'm not there would be overstepping his boundaries as well....he would always make sure that if he were to ever invite her over, he would definitely make sure i was present and no, he didnt find what she said appropriate either, but knew she had good intentions only because of her faith. we left it at that. fast forwarding to 5 months later (last weekend) we hang out with betsy again. i'm sorry to say it, but after this night, i came to the realization that this girl is a trainwreck. narcissistic, sweet talking, charismatic, disturbing convictions, a charlatan, and a trainwreck. up until now, i fell for the act too. i thought she was lovely, inspiring, had a giving heart, maybe really annoying, but what i saw this 3rd time was just a new, drastic development. she proudly stated that she hates women, thinks very few women have good intentions, blah blah and i cant bear it when people lack so much perspective on the world and on people's situations so i shut her comment down real fast (albeit in a polite, loving way). i also noticed that she was throwing pretty obvious slights at me throughout the night, and one of them was thrown at me even before the moment i shut down her misogynistic comment, and she said it in front of my bf,and one slight she made was for my shoes i was wearing (this was her reaction after i just lightly commented that my feet were hurting after a long night from my half inch sandals. she said: 'oh, honey thats why i hate heels! haha you know i dont have to be wearing heels to impress no man!' yes, she isn't very bright, is she?) and even when she first got in the car with us when we were about to go out for the evening, she addressed me as "poor little *my name*" when the topic of abduction sooomehow came up by her (welp so much for a lighthearted topic to get a convo rolling! debby downer saves the day) and she was going on about how she knew all the combative self defense moves for her and my bf to rescue "poor old me" if i were to get abducted, painting herself as a strong dominant female, and me as a damsel in distress. biiish, please. it was a weak dig on her part, and i let it slide though, and i didn't let it offend me (this was the first kne of the night, and i called her out on the other one). i did however, take note that my bf didnt come to my defense in either one, though both times she pulled that, he looked at me to see what my reaction would be. i also didn't notice previously, but betsy has some violent thoughts, and verbalizes them under the guise of jokes, even towards members of law enforcement (the most subtle of which was when she was 'joking' with a cop, telling him that she's going to step on his fellow colleague's toe if he doesnt bring back her beloved pocket knife that he promised he would, after confiscating it from her in the security line before an event we went to). this is her logic: 'oh but i'm a licensed and trained paramedic with sooo much life experience and i have plenty of cops as my buddies so i can get away with comments like that around a whole different breed of police officers, no problem! i dont care if i make the people around me super uncomfortable!" thank god the cop just humored her and/or thought (rightfully so) that she was a basketcase. sadly, what happened next was what tipped things over for me. she had overstepped the boundaries a second time, and this time it wasnt a text. this was actually effed up, what she did. at the end of the night, this is what happened: one of her sob stories actually won my boyfriend over, and i don't know if it was just a misunderstanding that i, just by unfortunate coincidence, just happened to not be present during this sob story display she made to him, in order for me to gain some sort of context and understanding as to what they would be talking about later on at the end of the night (either it was unfortunate coincidence, or more than likely whatever voodoo she was working on my boyfriend at the time, and she wanted to wait til i wasnt around) a convo that i was away from for all of 7 minutes tops, as i had to use the ladies' room. but apparently during this time, they had more than enough time to have a conversation about her finances (he said later on that he brought it up, asking her about how her business was going), and then evidently she opened up to him and in 7 minutes, she told him everything about her hardships: she might lose everything, because her self made cleaning business isn't going so well, she cant pay her bills, etc. to be clear, the last time we talked to her 5 months ago, everything seemed to be going fine. she bought us dinner, and there was no mention of her going through hardships (she would later lie about that in a text to me). and look, i realize things happen and people have struggles come into their lives in very short periods of time, and i empathize with them, not just because i know what it's like, but because i want to help them in any way i can, and when it happened to me, i didn't even have support at the time. she however, has plenty of support, and plenty of friends. my bf knows this. however i just thought it was extremely suspect that i wasnt there when she put this weird branch of divided loyalties into my boyfriend's head (she knew what he would say, or what he would offer, i guess, but i certainly didn't see it coming, i was completely blindsided). needless to say, i had no idea this conversation between them even happened until later that night when i was boiling next to my boyfriend in bed after what he had said to her in the car on our way back to drop her off. this is what he said (i was trying to sleep during the ride home, and i told them, so they knew my eyes were closed in the front passenger seat, but i was conscious, very much awake and heard it all.) my boyfriend said to her: 'well betsy, i just want you to know that you can always move into my place and sleep on the couch anytime you want! totally rent free, too!' to which she coyly responded 'awww yeah i could cook and clean at the very least too! get the apartment clean for ya! aw thanks so much, guyssss!' (betsy knew damn well that i was trying to sleep, nor was i involved in any way in this conversation, so she addressed me in there when she knew, or thought, that i wasnt listening. why did she address me if i had no context as to what the f they were even talking about when i was in the restroom??? ) even worse was my bf's response when she offered to cook and clean, he replied enthusiastically with a 'yeah of course! wow i dont know how you have time to do all that cleaning though! you really know how to prioritize!' like, um helllooooooo! i'm right f******g here? like next to you!?!?!? i felt like he was somehow , for some reason, intentionally trying to p*** me off. we have never had problems in pur relationship. i always tell him to be open with me, and yet he always tells me that he would be, and that theres nothing i've ever done that has annoyed him, and that he loves me for who i am and treasures every th ing about our relationship. he's so sweet but he's just so dumb! so, they subtly changed the topic after i stirred. later in bed that night, i was next to my boyfriend crying my eyes out, and i asked him right then and there if he was planning on consulting me before just inviting someone to come live with us, someone who i reminded him we had a problem with in the past...he said 'oh...well i sounded like i was offering it to her, but i wasnt really offering babe...honestly, i dont know why i said it, i think i just wanted to say it to be nice, and plus, she has support, she has friends who will help her, but i'm not gonna let her go homeless if she does lose everything. shes gonna have a roof over her head.' and i asked him what the actual hell was going on, especially with the cooking and cleaning comment, and also that i knew nothing about her hardships prior to their convo, why he didnt run it by me, why no context was given, that he and i were planning on building our own future in his homestead, and i said that however much i admired him for his giving nature, he could've offered help and consolation to her in other ways, rather than giving her an empty offer that he admitted he couldnt fulfill and dividing his loyalties (he is not the kind of person to break promises, so i don't think he was being honest with me when he said he offered it to her only because he felt sorry for her). i also let him know that he was putting me in a stressful, confusing situation with a possibly very strange dynamic that i did not feel comfortable with. regardless. she somehow made her problems his problems, and imposed herself into our lives, so thereby that makes her a threat. it made me feel as though he werent serious about me at all. it was a dealbreaker to me, but i didnt verbalize that. after i expressed to him how hurt i felt that he didnt even consult me first, he said in a slightly sarcastically and patronizingly (which is sooo different for him, and just told me that he still was not understanding nor valuing my input or my comfort levels with this, nor the fact that i had almost been homeless many times in my life, and he knew that i was not comfortable having any more roommates, as i have been in roommate situations for the past 5 years and he knows i'm trying to get out of that): him: 'oh, ok, well i'm sorry for being a giving person to a friend in need. gosh. and yea she told me she was having money issues when you were in the bathroom. why are you making this such a big deal?' that's when i went from calm to livid, and i knew this girl was up to no good. thankfully, he did seem to understand later after i let him know, and i had remained very calm (somehow) and he was very apologetic and we made up after a lot of discussion, and i know he technically didnt do anything wrong, but i dont feel as though he can even protect me from situations like this in the future, he can't even mention having to run it by his girlfriend whom his loyalty is with, when this manipulative b***** has him wrapped around her finger even when his girlfriend is present, so honestly, why would i continue? it doesnt matter how pure or innocent his intentions were. but...does it? i then said i didnt feel like he and i were ready to move in together. i had to end up texting her myself and i let her have it. i explained my disappointment in what was said between both of them, and i then explained my boundaries to her and that i felt disrespected (i let him tell her his boundaries, and whether or not he ever will tell her is completely up to him, since he clearly didnt do it last time, like i hoped he would, he just encourages her because she strokes his ego and it makes him feel good). within these texts to her, i reminded her of something unspoken, but widely practiced called 'lady code' to which she replied like the narcissist that she is. in summation, she replied to my valid concern with a copout excuse for her behavior and a textbook narcissist response: 'oh hey girl about the cooking and cleaning, that's just my humor! and um honestly i have bigger fish to fry and cant let myself be bothered with your trivial schoolgirl-age worries, i'm 35 sweetie and no i'm not going to apologize for any confusion i may have caused. but no, i have no intention of moving in with any couples.' my reply: 'yes honey i agree! i'm too old for trivial stuff like this too. and your meaning (ahem, excuse) for what you said is just not what i took away from the exchange. you're changing your tune now? all you couldve said was 'no thanks!'to his offer if you didnt have ulterior motives. what you lack is respect for boundaries and for women and their relationships. i don't know what your intentions are, but honey, trust and believe that i dont trust you as far as i can throw you, and i definitely dont trust you around my boyfriend. he never would've not consulted me about something like this had you not somehow worked him and clouded his judgement. christian, you say? yeah, lord forgive me if i'm wrong, but i'm getting very opposite vibes from you, honey. i caught every slight you threw at me and now? around you, my guard will be up and it will stand as tall as highclere castle, if we have the misfortune of crossing paths again! oh and the bf and i are quite happy, love! bye! i hold myself to higher standards than this." guys, this was exhausting, i know. i hope someone's at least entertained at this point. i dont know what to do, because at the end of the day, i can't unhear what i heard in that car, no matter how lightly they meant it. but i told my boyfriend what she said in response to my text, her shady narcissistic response, and he now knows that i'm not taking her (or his) $h!t. but i'm honestly wondering now, if my bf is so easily entranced by women like this??? dayum i mean, that's just bad. i can spot women like this a mile away. can i even trust him to not fall into their manipulative mind traps in the future? i just dont know if i'm ready to go on at this point, and i want to love him, but i'm just losing the respect i once had for him....i thought he was smarter than this... tldr: i'm thinking i need to break things off with my boyfriend because of some dumb thing he said to his female friend in front of me and how easily he panders to people he doesn't know very well. i have a problem with his narcissistic female friend and feel disrespected, but *he* technically didnt *do* anything wrong. i am just losing what i once felt for him, though. is this bad enough to end a relationship?	0

tiktok made me buy it list i'm sure this will come across like an advertisement and i wouldn't blame you for thinking that, but i think a lot of you will find value in this post so i figured i would share. i put together a list of products suggested by tiktok users. it's pretty interesting stuff. but soon i might have to shut it off because of the executive order. hope you guys enjoy it while it's still up! <url> ‚ú® if you've ever been on the fence or waiting for the right moment to start a business or new hobby, consider this your sign! take your first step today! no matter how small! the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step--some progress is infinitely greater than no progress at all. ‚ú® the first global pandemic in my lifetime taught me how fragile my financial situation truly was. out of desperation, i finally started a small online business. it was my dream to open a shop of some kind and, while i couldn't do it in person at this point, it felt good to make my first sale. if you have time and want to check it out, please do. it really helps me get closer to making this a full time job (a long ways away from that right now). and if you really enjoy it, consider sharing on social media--if i can ever get something viral, it could really give me the momentum to make it a true business.	0

nearly done my mother screamed at me when she wanted me to drop out for community college at 15, and i wanted to just change schools so i'm not bullied. "don't try because i'll win." she screamed at me when i said i wanted to go to college. "you never do anything to help yourself." she wondered why i don't say anything. she said "you have to turn everything into an argument" when i tried to explain why i want antidepressants, even though she doesn't want me on them. she didn't believe me when i said i wanted to commit suicide until we saw a counsellor. i'd repeatedly hear "you're too sensitive", "can't say anything around you." she would give me so much constant criticism that i just didn't want to be in her view. if i had a task to do, i'm not going to do it in front of her. she threatened to cancel university when i said i feel like i have to justify everything. "don't get cross." now i've left home and they're kind. but i just want to give up. i'm in $50k debt and dropped out from 4 institutions when i could have just been supported instead and not be in a train wreck. üòü	1

it will get better i joined this sub a while ago, when i was feeling awful. i've been fighting with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for three years now. i'm on meds, i've been to psychiatric hospital, i've been taught individually and all, my parents are very supportive and they help me so much. now i'm getting better. i'm still not fully cured and satisfied, but i can see the progression. i've noticed that there are many more happy things in my life now. i'm so glad that i didn't kill myself and i'm here now. i thought it won't ever get better, but it did. i just want to tell you that there is a chance for you too. it might take a while for you to figure everything out, but trust me, it'll be worth it. please don't lose hope and just stay alive. i know my words probably mean nothing to you, but if you feel like you want to talk, dm me on instagram (@fudanshiwithnolife_aone) or here on reddit. thank you for still being here ‚ô•Ô∏è	1

just got out of the er for the second time in the past week last night. i was raped last week, on top of everything else i was already dealing with. the hospital i've been taken to has done essentially nothing and let me walk out unattended and completely alone. i'm going to die soon. i don't even really know what to say. it's not like i expected something else, i've been abused extensively before so this is really just another box i can check off. thought i was in my survivor story but evidently not. thanks for listening friends. my self worth is so completely shattered that i cant see myself staying alive for longer than a week. they took all my pills at the hospital and i have to go to a pharmacy every day to get my scripts for the day. that's what they did for me. a major inconvenience. it's pretty clear the kind of help i need just doesnt exist here. i feel kind of relieved. i have a kind of motivation for dying that i just didnt have before. night reddit thanks again üëã	1

i have a teacher crush and he knows it. we have a newly graduate p.e and arts teacher in the start of the year and he is smokin hawt. a lot of girls had their eyes on him but as time passed, they all just saw him as "the good looking teacher" but it was different for me. i'm scared that maybe i have this obsession but i really hope it's just a teenage teacher crush that'll soon pass. i'm not too discrete about my crush on him with my friends because it's just a crush and it's illegal to have a teacherxstudent relationship anyway and i have my limits lol. soon enough, he also knew about it, my whole class teased me during his class, and even other teachers that i'm close with joined in too. it didn't bother me though, i'm actually amazed from their response. but because of that i got super shy around him and sometimes would completely ignore him when we walk past each other. i just simply slip in a short "good morning." there are times where i lose all my shame and full on show him that i do have a crush on him hahahaha but ofc i regret doing it right after. there was this recent event in our school and i gathered the courage to ask him for a picture, and i did! i was really happy about it and would keep looking at the picture whenever i took hold of my phone. he even put his arm around my shoulder sjsksjsksjsksksk i died that day. christmas party came and i gave him a gift (it was a blue shirt) and asked him for a picture before 2018 ends. after giving him the gift, he held his hand up and i was expecting for a high five so i raised mine and oh god he held my hand so tight and just swung it back & forth. he was looking into my eyes and said thank you with the biggest smile i ever saw he had. my friends giggled and goddamn that man knows his effect on me. after bidding goodbye, i was so hung up on that moment i think i drooled while rewatching the things that happened in my head. i went home with a happy heart that day :) it was 3 minutes before christmas and i was thinking hard on what message should i send him. when the clock hit 12:01am i just went with the simple "merry christmas! ‚ù§Ô∏è" and continued to message my other friends and greet my family. after a hard night, i woke up to his message saying "merry christmas [my naaaaame]! ‚ù§Ô∏è" and damn what a christmas morning i had. we chatted for a couple of minutes after that and as soon as our conversation ended, i told my friends about it & they were so excited for me hahaha. anyways thank you so much for reading this long ass post. i just wanted to share it with y'all :) this year has been great and i hope yours was too. btw, he has a girlfriend so i'll just put my love for him at the side and admire him as his student. what's annoying is that he is such a flirt because he knows i have a crush on him, and continues on posting pictures with his girlfriend (ugh my highschool student heart) hahahaha i respect him & his girlfriend tho :) thank you again for reading and tell me what you think!	0

some people just don't have luck üôã this is how it is. i've seen it happen before. really genuine and good person getting ill then suffer with illness then get a bit better with a spice of false hope and then worse again and then die. i know that even that slight slight hope i have for the future is false. i've got chronic, progressive illness... it'll never get better. i think holding on to my life right now is like holding on to the toxic relationship. and you keep struggling cause you still love some aspects of that person/life and absolutely not everything is bad, and you're kinda used to it and attached... though every one of your friends or family sees that this person is no good, if you ask them what to do, they say go cold turkey on that person, leave. don't look back. well.. i'm breaking up with my life. cold turkey style, for real. it's so so tempting to tell my dad how serious situation is, so he would press on a doctor to hurry up a bit and give me some of that sweet hope. one or two painless years or something that i can get before it gets worse again. but it will get worse again. and i know that my life during that year won't suck too much i'll get attached again and it'll be hard to leave ... i will wait until tomorrow, then leave while i still can. a.	1
kindness still exists in the world i live in a large-ish city. i waited too long to remove the snow around my car (street parking), and basically everything froze into ice blocks around my car. i couldn't even open the driver side door; i had to crawl in from the passenger side. i was hacking away at the ice with my handheld scraper, and a very nice young man, early 20s maybe (?) came up to me after parking his car and asked if i needed help. i said it's not a big deal, and he still offered to help break up the ice with his metal shovel he had in his car. so i stood aside while he cleared the ice, and i crawled back in and tried to move the car. after, maybe, 2-3 attempts at this, the ice broke up enough for me to maneuver my car out of the enclosed ice box space that was on the street. i rolled down the window and thanked him again, and he said, "well, i just know that if it was me trying to clear my car, i'd want someone to help me. have a good night!" to all of those unsung heroes who do things like this out of kindness, it makes a big difference.üôè üôè	0

i had my first kiss with someone who hates me. we are both female and we were 12. lets call her a. she had been distant toward me for a few months before this event, which was in swimming class st school. she had stopped attending choir lessions, telling me that she is no good, and wants to draw instead. we used to hang out nearly every single day, and had a whole fantasy playworld. we held hands and i suppose we were the types to lay in the grass together too. i never thought of kissing her. however, to me she were the most amazing, talented and prettiest person alive. i was into boys at 11, and i hit puberty pretty hard, alone. none of the other girls were quite there yet. i'm highly functional autistic(aspergers) and didn't know at the time. i moved to the country from the city. (a) was my classmate and we clicked within minutes. our main teacher was also a freelance choir teacher, and we would be her favorites before and after school. we had this teacher for only a couple of years. i have long blonde hair, and have always liked ti wear dresses quite feminine but practical. i was very innocent and naive, and my parents beleived in being the better person. never standing up for yourself, but instead explain. and accept that they who wish to harm you probably have it worse in life than you. we're not religious. when at school i would wear french romantic dresses my grandparents bought me. i'm very beloved and protected by them. they still see me as a child, and are stuck in that time-saying it was their best years when me and my sis were children. at school i was told frequently "we don't wear clothes like that here". i didn't really care. i told them that's their opinion, but personally i liked it. all of a sudden, (a) belonged to the popular girls, and they would start to subtly poke at my confidence. i was pretty confident. noone could make me cry etc at the time. i was slim but got pretty obvious curves, and that was not "in" back then. the days of the miss sixty trousers. it got worse. (a) asked me playfully to keep a secret and duck under water with her, and she gave me a long normal kiss. i broke the secret by thinking it was a prank, and was told i was lying. after the kiss she slowly became cold toward me. i'm thinking it may not have been a prank? she would "never be at home" anymore or "feel poorly" and sent her mom to lie to me at the door. meeting her outside with my bike was our normal hangout. i gave up after 3 weeks. the girls would stop inviting me to things, and one day my birthday came, and noone showed. i didn't invite the while class, but it destroyed me. i had prepared cakes and activites with my mom. i didn't confront them about it, but would instead be their awkward pet. i used these years to build social skills by testing out social bounderies and social rules. i needs to understand the patterns. other kids would bore me, so i never befriended anyone. i didnt't think of this as a strategy, but it definatly did more harm than good. the only life i had was the creative after school and lots of family time which was enough to keep me kinda sane, or so i thought. i got a tiny bit chubby, which finally gave one of the now clearly bullies (l) of the girl group to have something to really comment at. i've battled bulimia because this, bit have won over it. and the memory of (l's) smug face makes my blond boil. l was even chubby herself. the whole class of 199*- would now turn on me. i've been beaten and spat on by the boys. to this day, i don't understand why. i hit back once, but got scared of how strong i was. i wanted to escape the country. tante as now my goal. i spent the nest two schools pretty much alone. some would call themselfes my firends, but i felt numb and no connection, and developed anxiety. my talent got kinda wasted. i lost the confidence i needed. in high school (a) would compliment me after singing/guitar perforences. and at graduation (a) figured, although we never ever talked that i would move back to the city. she was right. she gave a very, very long and tight hug. i was confused. ironically we now live in the same city. she moved here a few years after me, and i'm terrified of bumping into her. i'm not very good at hate, and i dont't hate her. i'm an adult now, but all of this still haunts me to this day. i'm working on myself, and am much stronger with a good life and social circle. i still struggle with trust, and the part about people liking me or not is now forever lost. so i connect being invited as being accepted. after failed birthdays in childhood and teens (yes, i tried again. thanks, mom.), i've never dared to host one today. i still obsurdely feel that noone would show up. i haven't proof-read as this is painful stuff, so i hope it's understandable. english isn't my first language. it might be a big ol' mess. i'm open to explaining in the comments. thank you if you read all this! ‚ù§Ô∏è none of my friends can work this one out. why did a ditch me, and why did she initiate that kiss? i have no idea what all of it all means. maybe someone has an opinion or a similar experience?	0
the light grows ever dimmer as the end of the year approaches.the ache is my chest goes away less and less these days. i sleep a lot and yet i'm still exhausted all the time. in a mental haze, fading away. squandering years of education, drowning in student debt. my therapists are taking time off for the holidays. everyone in my immediate family is dead. my friends are home for the holidays and i just left a bad relationship. i'm so fucking lonely and i feel so selfish for admitting it. i'm also feeling myself physically start to fade. i've stopped eating much at all. i used to be so scared of this sinking feeling, but i'm trying to embrace it like a warm blanket. there is nothing else. thank you for listening... ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

considering suicide. i'm just so empty and so exhausted. the last 3 and a half years i've suffered from chronic tmjd where i've had headaches, facial pain, ear problems like a blown out speaker sensation with loud music and sounds, face sensitivity and just feeling hopeless. before this i was in the best period of my life where i was working, had friends and was super, super happy. in the last 3 years as i've gone to appointments, tried medications and been in pain and sad, i've developed severe anxiety and depression to the point where my life is getting smaller and smaller. the pain makes me anxious which then makes me depressed. then when the pain is easier, my anxiety will be bad and will stop me from doing things. i never had anxiety like this before my tmj issues flared up. i thought things were going to be so much better. just over 3 months ago, i had surgery on my jaw to hopefully rectify the problem. i had both discs in my jaw stitched back and my wisdom teeth taken out on all 4 sides. i was praying when i woke up from the surgery that there would be no more crackling when i swallow or no more damaged hearing. i was told the pain would take a while but the ear symptoms should go immediately. lying in my hospital bed after the surgery and all the symptoms still being there crushed me, but i was being positive. i remember the night before the surgery lying in bed thinking i felt 'good' mentally. no anxiety, no depression, just hopeful about the future. i knew it was a risk; go well and everything is back to myself. go badly, and i'd sink lower than ever. ever since the surgery, i've been a wreck. i collapsed a day later and was rushed to hospital. i was fully conscious but just felt completely vacant and spaced out. this was absolutely terrifying and they put it down to the heavy pain drugs i was on that makes people feel a little loopy. since then it's been anxiety attacks all the time, depression and just feeling unlike myself. these panic attacks are horrendous. i feel spacey headed and my mind convinces me i'm crazy. i can't stop shaking, pacing and can't switch my negative thoughts off. i was suicidal pretty much every day before this surgery because of the pain and the situation, and i think knowing all that had to happen was the symptoms to go and i was myself again just crushes me more. now in in a deeper hole with my pain, depression and now severe anxiety. my suicidal thoughts are overwhelming, but i keep going for my mum and my girlfriend. i honestly just want my old life back. before this, like i said, i was so, so happy. new job, new friends. i was making something of my life and then this hits me. i feel trapped like i can't move forward. i have a good day anxiety wise or depression wise. i feel happy, but then go to bed crushingly sad because i know my pains and symptoms haven't gone so i'm still stuck. i just feel totally, totally hopeless. thank you to whoever reads this. ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

my (20f) boyfriend (25m) makes me feel like i'm going crazy! i'm so frustrated... my boyfriend is the most wonderful man ever when we're good, he's like prince charming and will do anything and everything for me and goes to the end of the earth for me. i've never been treated so good before but when we argue he becomes the biggest douche ever and it drives me crazyüò≠ he always tries turning everything around on me to make it seem like my fault, constantly brings up stuff from the past, calls me crazy and psycho for calling him out on his shit which in return makes me feel like it's really my fault. whenever i start crying out of frustration he just stands there rolling his eyes and says it's annoying when i cry and that i'm too sensitive.. when i tell him all i need is comfort when i'm upset all he does is hug me and then says, "k are u done crying? i'm not dealing with this anymore" without actually talking things out properly with me. but when it's the other way around and he's upset and i don't comfort him back because of him never doing it for me, he gets depressed and tries to make me feel like a piece of shit so i feel like there's a huge double standard here.. so in return , i always end up cuddling him and telling him how much i love him when he's sad even tho i never get that back when i'm sad. it's so frustrating !!!! every fight ends with me crying now cus i cant stand how little he acts like he cares during arguments. i just need advice or help with how to deal with this or what i can say to him cause i don't plan on ending the relationship. also, we've been dating 7 months & live together. tl;dr: bf is the most amazing bf when we're good but turns in to douche while arguing and always makes it seem like my fault. need advice with what to do or how to handle situation next time.	0

novels with the sharpest dialogue just tore through the friends of eddie coyle by george higgins - whoa. everything you've heard about the dialogue being sharp and fresh is true, even 50 years after publication. having spent time in boston (not involved in crimeüëçüèº) it rang so true to the culture that powers the city. junot diaz and pg wodehouse are two others i think do this incredibly well. what other novels capture a time, place, and culture through how characters?	0

tinnitus is testing mehonestly...fuck this. i'm a 21 year old tortured male with several severe mental and physical health conditions that make my life a waking nightmare. i will decline to elaborate here on my conditions and broken life because it's too much personal information. it will suffice to say it's more than bad: others would have killed themselves in my place years ago. i've suffered enough to the point where acquiring tinnitus is pushing me over the edge. i don't have the means to end it anymore but i wish i had a way out. i don't want to suffer anymore. i aborted a suicide attempt a few months ago and i'm already regretting being condemned to an existence where i no longer enjoy life or have the opportunity to create a decent one. tinnitus took my silence, pieces of my sanity, and my last shreds of a will to live. i just want it to stop. üò≠	1

when i was 11. ‚ö†Ô∏è trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è when i was 11 years old, i tried to kill myself. i took 13 sleeping pills from my grandmother and went to go lay in bed. a couple minutes later my mom came in my room to ask me if i was hungry. i was anorexic at the time, and i barely ate anything because i hated the way i looked. my mom tried waking me up but she couldn't do it, she found the bottle of pills under my pillow and apparently called an ambulance.. my doctor was screaming at me but i only remember little pieces of what happened, my heart stopped before they could pump my stomach and they got it going again. i remember looking up in the hospital bed and looking around, everything was bright but dark as-well. i hallucinated, felt sick, and was so tired for the next couple of weeks. i don't know what happened within the first three days. i was blacked out for a half of a week and had these terrible headaches for weeks after it happened. i'm 17 now and these feelings are coming back again. i don't know how to control them..	1

a semi-quick, boy friendly, period explanation!üî¥ hiya, all! it's me, back at it with another post for my guys on this sr. so! periods! here's a list of things you should know about them: - first and foremost: they suck - girls spend lots of money on not staining everything (aka: tampons are expensive) - there's a lot of blood. we don't mind. we're used to it. - we're really insecure about leaking! don't tease us! it'll get rough! - our emotions are amplified, not different. they're still valid. - give a girl a hoodie or something to cover herself with if she's leaking. you have no idea how much it'll mean to her. that's all! drop your questions in the comments and i'll answer them all when i get back from camp!	0
why does the world keep telling me to chin up even though i'm forever alone? i'd like to be in a relationship and get married and all that fun stuff. i honestly hate the narrative "just be happy with yourself!!!!1!1!!" like of course i'm fine with myself. it's just be better if there was someone else around to do life with. it seems like they say that because i want a relationship because society says i should, and not because a human can want that sort of a thing. üôÑ	0

everybody listen up (lgbtq+ community especially)! last night my car was vandalized. one of the things that was done was "honk if your gay" (ik its "you're" but they wrote "your" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) was written on the back of my windshield. last night it completely wrecked me as i have been through alot recently and the fact that someone dislikes me enough to come find my car (which everyone in my life knows is extremely valuable to me) and vandalize it kinda sent me over the edge. however, as i drove to work this morning, so so many people were honking, driving by and smiling, i was getting waves, and even this big ass semi truck honked his horn a few times (which scared tf outta me tbh because i forgot the words were on the back of my window and i thought i was about to get hit by a semi hahhh..) the point im trying to make is i would never have thought there would be that many people so supportive of the gay community in my area, and that got me thinking that alot of you struggling with your sexuality probably feel the same way, and probably feel like there's not alot of people in your daily life that would love and support you if they knew. today taught me a very valuable lesson, that no matter how alone you feel, or what you're struggling with, there's support out there and people who know exactly what you're dealing with. you are all loved, and anything and everything you need (including love and support) is out there for you, none of you are ever alone!	0

tifu by underestimating the power of a common zit. so today i woke up as usual, walked up to my bedroom mirror and looking back at me was the biggest, evilest and the reddest looking zit i had ever seen in my life. as a guy it shouldn't have bothered me so much but you see i'm not the usual guy. and i don't usually get zits or pimples, whatever you calk them. time for a flashback üïêüïúüïëüïùüïíüïìüïìüïüüïîüï†üïïüï° when i was in school i barely had any friends, almost all the kids were into sports and i was a bit overweight and hence didn't mix up very well with everyone so over the years i worked really hard to get into shape and make friends. and now i'm in college. back to present all i could think of was that this zit was gonna destroy everything i had worked so hard for. also today was an important day as i was going to be working on a project with my crush. first i asked for a solution in r/askreddit which didn't work out so well cuz the only thing i had was the toothpaste and the remaining stuff out of my budget. so i did the the most fucked up thing..... i took a cloth and i smashed it..... at first all the blood came pouring out followed buy the wet watery stuff. i removed the cloth to see the damage. my life was doneüò≠ (if u wanna know what it looked like take some toothpaste put it on a table gently press with your thumb halfway the lift it up so it forms a valley) in case of my face it was a valley of blood. i panicked and did the next big mistake... applied my aftershave lotion which transformed the valley of blood into a raging volcano. tl;dr i got a zit, i panicked, i burst it, it looks ugly af, i apply lotion on it, it burns like hell, i finally give up on fixing the damage and decide to take the day off or at least till it gets fixed. and the teacher changed my project partner to some weebüò• edit :fixed some of my english	0

feeling really low today...it's the perfect storm i suppose, last night deciding whether or not to go no contact with an ex, and learned an uncle was dying. i tried to take the high road and was ultimately disappointed. it's so hard to make that clean break. even if he is a bit of a c*nt. i hate that when i try to live my convictions, i end up getting burned. (trying to be a big fan of the high road. being open, fair, and honest are important to me as well as not getting into the muck...but i'm a slow ass learner when it comes to others and what they are willing to do to someone else out of cowardice or selfishness ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) then there have been the deaths around me. a beloved teacher, and now i'm just waiting for the call saying that my uncle has decided to leave ( hospice has it down to hours) i'm a caretaker (which is absolutely, totally, a strain on my mental health) but it's family so i'm compelled to "do my duty". i woke up this morning feeling run over. i still had to do the "minimums" and while i was driving home i felt compelled to just jerk the wheel and end it. it's been awhile since my urges have presented so... aggressively and urgently. the "what does it even matter?" urges and questions flooded in. obviously i didn't do it, and i'm home, but it scared me. and it scares me that it's lingering so strongly. i'm going to start accessing my "mental health toolbox" try to take a high road for myself and to try to mellow out but i just needed to vent it out. good luck everyone else going through their version of this shit. all the love ‚ô•Ô∏è	1
how do i (20/f) say i'm not comfortable with my boyfriend's (25/m) trip without coming across as controlling?? long read so thanks to anyone who reads the whole thing but tldr at the end as always. so a bit of backstory to explain why i'm so nervous about how i sound: a few months ago i found out that my boyfriend of 3 years was writing and allowing one of his friends to say horrible things about me. we fought about it (to this day our only major fight) and he claimed he was just venting. we ended up seeing a couples therapist together whom we still see today but one of the main things his "friend" would say was that i was stupid and controlling (for example i booked a couples massage with the bonus i'd gotten from work. i originally was going to buy myself a new dress i'd really liked but he had been complaining about how sore he was after work and i simply didn't have the strength or energy to give a massage that would genuinely help him. i'd try but after half an hour i'd be left feeling drained and sore and he'd be no better off himself making it feel pointless. so i thought i'd surprise him by spending the money on something we could do together and actually benefit him. this was taken as "a stupid waste of money" as you *"could save the money and just do it for each other at home"* like i hadn't tried. then it was also controlling because i just "assumed" he'd be free that saturday. .... i live with the guy. he has the same schedule every monday through friday and always has weekends off so yeah - i assumed he'd be free because he never mentioned doing anything. if he was busy (which he wasn't) i would've happily rescheduled. ) all this to say that even though we are talking and doing a lot better now i still get worried about being called controlling when it's more anxiety and just uncomfortable with circumstances. i'm not saying no, i just wish we could talk more. a few weeks ago he sprung up about how his boss invited him to a baseball game the next evening. i'm a huuuuuge baseball fan (he is not but enjoys the beer so it's a win for him). i was jealous but excited for him- until he mentioned that he wouldnt be coming home at all that night. i asked what he was going to do; he told me he planned to sleep over at his bosses house with the rest of the coworkers who were also invited. his boss lives right down the street. like we are on a dead end road - you have to pass our apartment to get to his bosses place. i asked if he could simply be dropped off but he denied. i immediately clammed up. it was barely any notice and while i figured he'd be back late he wasn't going to come home at all? he wouldn't let me push it any farther and while i was upset out of fear of sounding bossy i just let it go. i hated it though. he said he was heading to the game straight after work so he wasn't even going to swing by home to shower or change just gone for 24-36 hours (saying if he also didn't come home in the morning before going to work. his boss got the game tickets for a tuesday night. it was a dumb move). he did end up coming home around 2 or 3 am which made me feel a bit better but man oh man did i hate going to bed that night under the impression that he was just.. not coming home. i felt like we hadn't talked about it much but i'm not sure what else there would've been to say.. now comes the problem that brought me to today: he came home yesterday after work and informed me that he was most likely going out of town june 1st aka just over a week from now. i asked him what for and he said there was a fair going on in a town a couple hours away for machine and 3d printing enthusiasts. my boyfriend mind you is insanely smart. i call him a sims character because he basically swallows information when it comes to anything computer/machine/tech anything. so when his buddy opened up a side business for 3d printing my boyfriend didn't just latch on to the idea he ended up learning how to code the programs in python over the course of a few days and is now basically a partner in his friends business. which means it would be a fantastic opportunity for them to go! i was really excited and happy for him but i still wanted a little more information. i asked if he was just planning on sharing a room with his friend "oh no way i'd be getting my own room, it's really close to a beach too so after the booth hours are done we could go hang out there too. like a mini vacation!" (mind you more than once we've talked about going out of town to do a mini vacation ourselves so i perked up at this). "we? i'm invited too?" "oh no it's just gonna be me, sam, and jack" *not real names obviously* "oh.. well if you're going to be getting a separate room anyways would it be okay if i came along if i got the days off of work? you know i've been dying to get out of the apartment and the beach would be amazing!" (i work across the street from where we live. outside grocery shopping we don't get out much so truly any chance to escape the apartment is a welcomed joy). "no i don't think so" he wouldn't elaborate much more past that. okay. i admit i was bummed and when i found out the trip is going to be the entire weekend.. it left me feeling icky. but again i don't want to be controlling so i'm trying to let it go. bf texts me today saying the trip might actually be off. when i ask why he says that the rooms are actually very expensive. while part of me i admit was a little happy he wasn't going to be suddenly gone the whole weekend i knew how badly he had wanted to go so i suggested he look around at close hotels that might be cheaper saying that sam could just pick him up on the way to the convention thing. no response for a while then i get this text: trips one. i guess sam is bringing mary (sam's wife?), the kid, and his parents. mary suggested i just share the room lmao. .... how do i explain how that made me feel?? so now it's gone from three guys road tripping down in a car that can't fit me too to sam, his wife, his child, his parents, you, and jack and now you're all going to share a room? how does that work? sam and his wife would most likely have a bed, saying it's a double room means his parents most likely have the other bed, then the kids and jack have to figure something out but so do you now- and this is most likely meaning that there are multiple cars involved so how am i still not allowed to come with? i'd love to support my bf at the convention- it's amazing watching him do something that excites him as usually he's a more blaze kind of guy. he lights up when he's doing something he likes. plus again i'm itching to get out the house and he doesn't seem to get that him going on and on about enjoying the relaxing beach without me is like salt on the wound. yes i'm happy for him, but it will suck being told by your so how nice the beach is while you're stuck on the couch at home when really there's no reason to be.. i dunno.. do i sound controlling? or bad? am i unreasonable to feel the way i do? i don't like having these events just sprung up on me and it hurts that i feel like i'm being pushy over something that i feel like should be a genuine conversation. it was one thing when it was 3 guys in a little electric car going on a road trip. i might not like it and might be jealous but he had a point it would be a bit cramped. but now it's sam and his family billy and him and i feel like me tagging along wouldn't be that big of a deal but he doesn't see the point in talking about it. also just for the record i've been told before that people think he's cheating on me. i can assure you he's not. he has never been one to cheat, sent a few pictures of himself at the game with his buddies and to top it off that was one of the main reasons i hated his "friend" so much. she was trying to convince him to lie and say he cheated on me so that i "wouldn't want him anymore". it was a whole thing. so i have complete trust that he's not cheating on me; but i do feel like he has a general disregard to my anxiety and feelings. i know it's not fair to say i have separation anxiety so he "can't leave me". which is why i've never asked him to stop or stay when i want that more than anything. i try to keep myself in check and when he wants to go out with friends once in a blue moon (he's a home body hence why we are always inside the apartment) i highly encourage it. i just wish he'd understand springing plans on me like this and not understanding why i'd like to come hurts me. if i had more warning or more understanding i'd feel a lot better but i don't know how to open that conversation back up without sounding controlling (my big fear). i should add the main reason i hate the timing so much is not only does that give me a weeks notice but on the 30th we have an obgyn appointment (21 weeks along at that point) and the 31st we have our next therapy session. so two major events that i'd like some time to discuss after about but he'll be out the door for 3 days out of town and essentially unreachable as he'll be busy with the booth and beach. anxiety through the roof. or maybe it's not anxiety but that heavy chest feeling that makes me feel like i might cry but can't really explain? i have no idea... ugggh. so reddit sorry for the insanely long read but what can i do? what do you think? any advice or thoughts on my situation would be appreciated.. i am trying my best to be a good girlfriend but i don't know what else i can do here.. i feel like i'm crazy so i'm trying to be as reasonable as possible.. but i'm still uncomfortable and want more.. communication i guess. but i don't know how to achieve it at this point in the conversation. helpüò´ tldr; boyfriend wants to go on spontaneous trip out of town without any warning and i'm seemingly uninvited despite everyone else who's getting to go. this isn't the first time it's happened but i don't know how to talk to him about it and how it makes me feel a little uncomfortable without coming across as controlling (a major fear of mine from previous circumstances). i just want to open up that line of communication but i don't know how.. help!üò´üò´	0

we should make a logographic writing system with emojis it would have no spoken or signed equivalent, and it would be universal, basically to maximize what we can say in the least amount of characters and have a written language we can all understand each emoji couldn't represent a phonetic sound cuz there would be no spoken equivalent but combinations of different emojis could mean different things so üá®üá¶ would just mean canada but something like idk üá≤üáΩ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüá®üá¶ could mean north america or something, and üá®üá¶‚û°Ô∏èüá≤üáΩ from canada to mexico, like ‚¨ÖÔ∏è could mean thing 1 through thing 2 like thing 2‚¨ÖÔ∏èthing 1 and ‚û°Ô∏è could mean thing 1 to thing 2 like thing 1‚û°Ô∏èthing 2 idk, i'm putting this idea into the world so someone else will do it, i wouldn't know where to start	0

anyone else struggle with hospitalization bc of weed? i'm really going through a tough time right now and about exactly a year ago today i smoked weed to cope and it helped way more than anything ever has. the problem was it triggered bipolar symptoms (i didn't know i had) so i was hospitalized and almost died because my heart rate rose so high. now the doctors aren't entirely sure if the weed was real or synthetic which is a huge missing part of the puzzle. i was hospitalized for about a month and am still taking meds till this day. now i don't want to be hospitalized again but part of me feels like the weed i had smoked was just synthetic and i'm not really "hyper sensitive" to regular weed like the doctors said. i really want to smoke again because it takes away all my anxiety but i don't want it to trigger my bipolar symptoms. has anyone had any similar situations? i really need help i have a counselor but i can't see her until wednesday üòñ	0

my 18-month-old kitty is now toothless. this morning i had to take my youngest kitty to a veterinary oral surgeon for a full-mouth extraction. as his permanent teeth were coming in, he developed [feline stomatitis - warning, gross pictures](<url>). we didn't know this because he's a very closemouthed kitty and he was eating and playing (and carrying toys around) with no signs of trouble. then, one day a few weeks ago, he woke me up by nibbling the tip of my nose; the stench of his breath told me that something was *seriously* wrong. an 18-month-old cat should not have deathbreath‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. off to the vet he went shortly thereafter. the vet took one whiff of his mouth and said, "this is a very serious problem." we were referred to the veterinary oral surgeon. i could have happily gone my whole life without knowing of the existence of veterinary oral surgeons. truth be told, i already knew of this one because of a dental misadventure with our dog last year ($1800). back i went with the kitty. today's visit was $2600. the kitty now has no teeth and is wearing a cone of shame and a fentanyl patch. all reports are that once his mouth heals he should have a good shot at a long, healthy, *much* less painful life. he was so stressed on the drive home that he shat himself in the crate. when i took him out of the crate, he turned into a tasmanian devil trying to escape the cone of shame. he's currently confined to one bedroom for his own safety... i feel so bad for the little beastie.	0

help me no sleep i need comfort i think i found a pedophilia ring online (cp) while trying to jack off jesus christ. so on xxnx there's search terms related to what you searched, and i like teens and milfs (don't judge bruh) being a teen myself. in the related term sections, i saw this weird term that was really random and i thought it was kinda funny because it didn't make any sense being on a porn site. so i googled what it meant and clicked on the first site i saw because it looked like a news site. i didn't actually see anything but it paste bin type of website with tor links and i fucking shut down completely. it was a really dodgy site and i clicked on the first link (christ) thinking that it was all a satire site and saw pics of this maybe 14 year old girl, with clothes don't worry, and it said "preview" on top. after that i realized i was in some deep shit. even though i didn't click, just realizing that this shit is really online and completely real is disgusting bruh. i can't sleep at all someone pls hug ü•∫	0

i gave up on life 5 years ago because i'm ugly...i'm male, aged 30 (look younger) 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) skinny af lanky with long legs etc, pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin (never touched a girl or even had more than a few words spoken to me by one) so yea in the looks department it's over. i never leave the house and havnt since 2015. between 2012-2015 i had a bar job,i had girls like me and i wasn't ugly then facially. i got older and ugly. i met some amazing people but also some horrors. horrible women who'd call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers i worked with. the good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times by a fat ugly overweight bitch. ‚óæheres an example: i serve a table of 6 'ladies' in their 40s food and try being polite and helpfully nice as i can. not one of them says thanks and they practically snatch the cutlery and plates of food from my hands when i pass it to them. when they finished eating a good looking guy i work with went over to get the plates and they stacked the plates up for him we're all saying thanks and we're laughing and joking with him he was there for a few minutes. fucking hags.‚óæ in the end i got fed up and left and havnt left the house since to let ageing hit me like a train. (before i had that job i had the same job advisor for 6 months and she was the same, i was very quiet but also polite and respectful and it got me nowhere, she was still snotty and bitchy with me and would totally ignore me if i asked her advice. but yet you'd see other guys who were aggressive and disrespectful but because they were manly and attractive she'd open up easily to them and be very nice with them and help them no problem. this gave me trust issues) i do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and that's the same, women staring me down because i'm skinny like it's my fault they're fat. other guys i work with staring at me with a 'wtf is that' face and overweight short girls calling me a 'ming' (whatever that means) it's great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and i think 'it's nice when someone looks past what i look like'. it's funny how i succumbed to judging people's niceness to how they judge me on my looks or not. but there isn't many like that about. i eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner i feel better. still hidoeus nevertheless. a comment on here once i asked about my hair one comment said 'he's clearly balding and hidoeus btw' and it got upvoted 17 times. i drink whiskey every night watching cartoons and i'm starting to get chest pains. also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 at work and she was gorgeous too. she worked in the bar with me. i was 24 then. you should see me now it's depressedressing i basically live upstairs watching netflix everyday and smoking weed in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or younger/older have looks on their side and a life to go with it. funny how most of them are cocky as hell and very arrogant and the girls love it. i have a friend whos like that he's cocky as hell and thinks every girls he walks past fancies him and you wouldn't believe how the girls love that persona on him too. it's not about getting girls for me, but i could care less about not getting sex tbh etc it's juts the restricted life i have because i'm ugly and seeing good looking dudes treated better even when they're complete cocky arrogant assoles. lookism man	1

2 years ago i tried to kill myself2 years ago (i was 14) i tried to commit suicide. i was at home alone, my sister and mother had gone out and my father was not there. i just woke up, i felt terrible, lonely and sad and so without thinking twice i took the box cutter that was in the kitchen and went to the bathroom, i sat on the floor, i was going to cut my wrist, since i was stupid i couldn't cut myself because i put the blade too close to my hand,(i don't know how to say it) and after that i was scared and i didn't cut myself anymore, who knows why i didn't try again. i'll never said that to my family and my sister, i was to scared. even today i want to kill myself, who knows what will happen. |sorry for my englishüíï| edit: thank you all so much for the nice comments, i really needed and i appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

vent club i'm 32f, he's 35m. for the first two years we were together, sex was kind of bad. he'd finish within two minutes max, and i'd have to finish by myself. (masturbate) did that for almost two whole years. i took the pipe and the load and got left high and dry. i asked one day why he didn't care if i went too, and he said "i can't help it, you're tight. i can't last". sometimes it'd improve, but would always go back to the way it was. then i meet a girl. i didn't know she was attracted to me until the day she made her move. she didnt want anything from me sexually. she just wanted to go down on me. we are drinking and smoking. i was f a d e d. she kisses me, and i kissed her. i had never kissed a girl before. sorry, i didn't like it :( i couldn't bring myself to kiss her again, mainly because of how aggressive she was being. she puts her hand down my blue jean shorts and tries to stimulate me, also by kissing on my neck, ears, shoulders, etc. you know when you're so drunk, you feel that dangerous spin that comes from deep inside when you're sitting still? yeah that was me. i was aware of that mouthwater thing that happens before vomit. her boyfriend busts through the door naked, short, and covered in body hair, like he's going to hop in and get in on it. he repulsed me when i was sober! my mouth fills with vomit and i accidentally get some spew on their bed and myself. i hurry to the bathroom, and finish throwing up. i clean up and come out, and these two were actually having sex..... near my vomit!!! i leave, and from then to today, learned to deal with my husband's short comings. no, he can't last longer then two minutes max, but at least he's not degenerate. i didnt tell him until three years later, during an existential crisis. a full blown mental breakdown. (october last year, now 6 yrs total) i am obviously in the wrong for doing all that. now our relationship is struggling. i love him so much, to a fault. i'm not trying to lose him. i want to deal with the situation but, he is a man, and talking about relationships is not a favorite pastime for them. and i'm a woman, i'm going to see odd behavior and rationalize it by jumping to baseless conclusions. is he cheating? will he revenge cheat? (he's spiteful sometimes) not to mention he gets angry if i look at his phone, and ask questions about who is who and what is what. i have been suspicious of him liking men, since he made no effort to try foreplay, and rejects oral activities. plus some other oddities, like questioning him, he's a guilty quiet and doesn't deny or confirm homosexuality outright at first. he will eventually say he's not gay, but not right away like i assume straight men do. i hate to say it, but it might even be his boss that he's interested in. i started checking his phone and he used a backup sms app. he said it was because of his calendar app. lies, and it's easy to tell. the app that restores his calendar has a root folder, and it wasnt modified on march 6th, it was from february 12th when he got his new phone. so he never touched it. then he accidentally uploaded all his texts to outlook while he was at work, but outlook was also signed in at home. i didn't read all the texts, i thought they were ones i already read. but then i think he deleted all texts except for the ones between us, and even the outlook accounts themselves. he says he doesn't know what happened to the texts or the emails... üôÑüòí i tell him i can tell he's hiding something. specifically one afternoon after days of trying to figure us out, "i just have to go i guess. you're not telling me the truth because you're probably afraid i will kill myself or that i will ruin your life." and he said nothing. he says its because he's tired of me constantly "coming at him" in an angry way, and that i accuse him of cheating for no reason. he makes me feel like i'm the crazy one. obviously this isnt all the info, i have much more damning evidence of him being gay, but this is already too long. am i buggin? tl;dr my husband sucked at sex for two years, and i almost cheated. didn't even do it. now our relationship is struggling and i am starting to believe he is gay anyway. any suggestions? or opinions? am i just deflecting and looking for things because of my own guilt?	0

thoughts of suicidei've been having thoughts lately. i won't do it now cos i'm too chicken shit to do it but i am really worried i'm going down that road again. been on celexa 40mg and remeron for 3 years, i feel like it's not working too well anymore. i quit taking it for a few days just to get rid of the brain fog every once in a while, and usually it starts working again, but now i feel like it's not working as well as it used to, or i'm just more depressed? my wife is due with our first child in january, i feel soooooo guilty because i should be happy but i'm not. i always told myself if things are too bad i always had an out (suicide), but i feel like i'm stuck even more than before. nothing is working for me, and i am afraid nothing ever will. oh and also my dad has parkinson's which is hitting him hard, my mom might have bladder cancer. what's the point of living to just go out like that. fuck that, i want to go out on my own terms. told my psych i don't think meds are working, but he pretty much just ignored me. told me to take melatonin at night üòí. i've had three different psychs just in the last few months because no doctors wants to stay at the place i go to.	1

pigeons today i was going to the market close to my house and then, lots of pigeons went to the sidewalk and just stayed there... walking slowly. they didn't even care about my presence and i even murmured: "excuse me.....

can't carry on anymore i've literally just made this account, because i really don't know what else to do with myself and i need a distraction. today was so horrible i feel like my outbursts of anger are getting worse and worse and today was probably the closest i've come to either running away or killing myself. everything is going wrong this year already, lost my job, broke af and my depression i've had since i was 14 has returned 100 times worse than ever. i've always contemplated suicide more times than i can count but today i think i actually scared myself in realising that it's something i'm eventually gonna do. i snapped at my mom again today this time it ended with her saying don't come here ever again, and at the time i don't give a fuck and will happily agree to never see her again, but it's when i return home and start crying to myself that i need my mom so much and that the whole argument was caused by me, i just don't know what to do anymore, leaving work has only made me realise how depressed i actually am, it's rare i come out of bed until it's past afternoon, the loneliness is creeping in again and i know i have literally no one to turn to now because i've pushed everyone away, and i'm terrified of what i might do üò™ sorry i've never posted on here before so i don't know what to do	1

needed to say this.it's strange how people act when they know they're suicidal. like if your life is at its worst point personally, and you know it's just a matter of time before you end it all...it's not *all* dramatic. you may be dramatic about it or your going-ons in the day...but it's not at all the thoughts that are dramatic. the thoughts are pretty simple. it's strange because it's almost empathetic. *"how do i kill myself with it being the most convenient (or least bit intrusive) for someone else?"* i'll give you an example. if i wanted to kill myself, let's say in the way that i'm going to be dramatic about it, by \*\***trigger warning - graphic**\*\*>!slashing my wrists!<... i'd do it but then i'd have to think about the carpeting upstairs. like blood barely comes off clothes easily when there's a huge stain, how the hell is it going to get out of the carpet? that's a whole upholstery cost and recarpeting the room is just going to be a bitch for whoever. that's why you sometimes have to do some creative thinking. *"hey! i could do it in the bathtub!"* but then you think *"man, that's...i mean i guess that works but it's uncomfortable and you have to drain it and people use that tub to shower, you think carpeting costs are high do you know how much it costs to replace a bathtub?"* i don't. but i imagine it's quite a bit. i think it stems from the fact that to be suicidal it's not that you're devoid of all emotion. you're really empathetic to your own situation in a very self-absorbed, self-aware, sympathetic way. like the pain and misery that this person feels you feel directly, and you wish you could help with the cliche suggested way of things but that's not going to help. that's like...trying to wash dishes with dirty dishwater. i mean, i guess it might clean it but damn, it's not ideal and why do it just to get the dishes all dirty anyway. instead you become empathetic to the all of it. the situation but also the thoughts and feelings. you understand, just as you would standing at the memorial service (if you're so lucky to have one) of a another fellow of the **what are we, some kind of suicide squad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è** club. you know, that feeling of "well, i mean...i guess i understand why he'd do it." what i'm trying to say is - that moment when you think to yourself *"damn, who would want to live like that?"* crosses the feeling of *"who can ever live like this?"* is where you get the final nail in the coffin of the decision to do it. *"why should i keep living like this?"* the only difference between the suicidal people and the people that decide to move, get a hair cut, change their outfits, and maybe their phone number, is that...well honestly it's just too much work. meh. rather kill myself than have to explain to that older lady at work why i thought it'd be a good idea to get frosted tips at 25. the thing is, anytime anyone actually goes through with it, it really does feel like a loss. you feel the potential they had to become someone, something big even. and that's because the people that do go through with it aren't actually lazy people. they're not at all. they're people that can have accomplishments, goals, aspirations, and the motivation and drive to actually achieve them. they have before and they prove it to you again with this one final exit of achievement. truth is, it's the failures that can't do it, can't go through with it, and so desperately wish they could that are lazy. unmotivated to achieve anything in life, and unwilling to do anything about it to change. even if that change involves just ending it, so you know there aren't going to be any further things to do afterwards. man, the only thing worse than people that are suicidal are those that are just failures in life. like bottom of the barrel trash. good people, people with goals and the personal means and will to achieve them are the ones we feel sorry for because they can go through with it. the guy standing in the crowd feeling sorry for himself wondering when he's next? meh, who cares. call me when you do something about it, otherwise fuck off. you're just a dramatic, hyper aware, failure of a human being right now. do something about it, and then people will notice. otherwise shut up, swallow some vali-zo-pro-loft or whatever and join the rest of the world who inevitably have it worse than you from the get go. wish i was the first kind, but it sucks that being part of that hyper aware crew. i'm at least aware enough to know suicide isn't right for me. i'm just a failure, so here i go again for another year or decade, thinking that maybe i'll do it but inevitably just posting here or something hoping whoever it is will notice and at least, for a little while, a human connection will be made between us. just even for the fact that hey, using dirty dishwater to clean your dishes is still something instead of just breaking the dishes all together. man. i hate doing the dishes.	1

my white southern grandma said something mildly funny for some context my grandma grew up in south texas so she says weird southern things all the time, but today was the first time i'd heard her say this. so my grandma was driving me and my brother to high school today, and the weather was pretty humid. it had been raining all night and it was still pretty foggy that morning. so while in the car line waiting to be dropped off my grandma maid a weird remark about the weather that went like this... grandma: i'd sure hate to be a cracker in this kinda weather. me: *looks to me brother confused* uhm what exactly do you mean by that grandma? grandma: well you know like a saltine cracker, because i'd get soggy. me: lmao ok? anyway i just found it funny as i'd never heard her say this before and honestly wasn't quite sure what she meant it as at first ü§£	0

wasting each oppurtunity that i had to apologise to her before she died. my stubbornness cost me dearly. okay, here goes. my story is from ten years ago, my mother's mother (my nan) had lived with us almost all my life. i had always been extremely close to her and i loved her tremendously. i didnt get along well with my mother and my nan was always there, in her own part of the house, for me when i really needed someone. she wasn't this image of sweet old grandma baking cookies, she was as my dad always described her 'an old battleaxe'! she was an amazing person, and i spent countless hours in her part of the house as a child. ten years ago, i was 16. my nan became ill and unable to leave her bedroom. her legs became inflamed and swollen and every few days nurses had to come in to wrap new bandages around her legs. she became unable to walk even to the toilet, but her pride and stubbornness wouldnt let my mom help her. after a while her mind started to fade and she would call out at random times of the day, yelling about this and that, seeimg imaginary creatures and people in her room, calling us by the names of her late sisters etc. it was hard on us all as a family to deal with, we took food to her and kepy her company for as much time as we could spare to sit in that room, but tensions were so high. my mom was so unhappy and she wanted so desperately for my nan to go into a carehome where nurses would be on hand and she would be assisted to use the toilet and shower etc. they argued all the time and i always pitied my nan so much, such a proud stubborn woman was now hiding soiled clothes in her bathtub. it was horrible. i didn't get mad or pissed off at my nan and i helped take her her dinner and i spent a couple nights sleeping in her room when my family were away. i enjoyed spending time with her but it wasnt the same anymore. she didnt know what day of the week it was, despite watching tv each day and having tv magazines. she didn't know it went my 17th birthday and my 17 year old self was hurt. my mom bought a card and got my nan to sign it but i didn't want it. my birthday was the beginning of the end really, that was november and come the january my nan was in a sad place mentally. she'd become so stressed and felt so pressured about going into a carehome. she started refusing the dinners we made and became generally more demanding. banging on the floor for a cup of tea 30+ times a day made my mom so upset. one day in january my mom returned home to tell me she had found my cat dead on the road and i was heartbroken. she had retrieved his body and i cried and stroked it for hours. the next day when taking my nan her food i told her about my cat, she was in a bad mood and she said i dont care about a stupid cat. we argued then, unlike we ever have before. she said such nasty things and i said such nasty things back. she ridiculed my school situation (i was in and out of college unsure what i even wanted to study) and i shouted back at her that she hasnt had a life since my grandad died a decade before, that she'd given up, that we only ever wanted to help her and she was ungrateful. we shouted back and forth, i called her pathetic and she started to cry. i turned to leave, i remember i felt ready to cry, i remember turning and giving her such a nasty look before i stormed down the stairs. i never saw her again. a week passed since the argument and my mom kept telling me i should apologise to my nan. i said no way, i was stubborn too. i said she'd hurt my feelings really badly and i felt so angry at her. my mom said it isnt as though nan can walk down the stairs and come to me, i didnt care. another week passed and my mom told me my nan had asked where i had gone, i remember thinking then, i miss her i should see her again. i didnt go up the stairs, i was an stubborn idiot. a couple of days later, my dad took my nan's dinner upstairs and found her dead on her bathroom floor. he wouldnt let me and my sister go upstairs and see her. i asked him 'will she be okay?' he shook his head and whispered 'i think she's gone'. it was the worst day of my life. i didnt see her body in the house, my dad said it was very distressing to see her slumped on the floor. i saw them wheel her out the front door under a sheet. i saw her body in her coffin a week later. her face was all bruised from having hit the sink as she fell. her heart had just stopped and she'd died in an instant. in her coffin i put a piece of paper with the lyrics i had written down, of evanescense's song 'forgive me' (check out the song if you havent heard it, they said everything i wish i had said to her). i had regret and guilt so heavy on my heart that it felt suffocating. i thought i would never be able to rid myself of the constantly nagging reminder of all those opportunities i had to say sorry. it has been ten years now and every memory i have of her is somehow tainted with knowing how she last saw me, as cruel and spiteful. she loved me for all the years of my life and in the very last time she saw my face, it was a nasty scowl directed right at her. my story is very long, but i suppose the moral of this one is obvious. thanks for reading my story, its been an incredibly difficult thing that i have had to live with but it gets better. i had so many dreams in the years following her death where i would run upstairs and she would be there sitting in her chair. id cry and shout im sorry and she'd tell me it didnt matter. the dreams have faded now and i feel more at peace than i used to. i wish everyday i could see her again. cherish the people you love ‚ù§Ô∏è ( tl;dr i argued with my nan and wasted each oppurtunity i had to apologise to her, she died a fortnight later and living with the feelings of guilt and regret have been extremely difficult )	0
not checking if i had my credit cards this just happened an hour ago!!! omg i am such an idiot! it was epl night so we friends went drinking. i was running late as usual. reached there and everyone was around 4-5 drinks down already. ordered a pitcher and united were 1-0 down in the first half (i'm not a united fan). making fun of them and chelsea winning. etc. lots of banter. a friend left after an hour since he had a date and two of us were left. now this friend started feeling a little weird second pitcher in so i told him to leave get home and sleep. both of them paid their bills before leaving and i said i'll be fine watching football and finishing my beer. the second pitcher was still half full. like an idiot, i asked for the cheque, rather confidently. it comes, i open my bag and voila! i have no wallet. only 300 inr. and a food card, which i haven't yet activated. i rushed to the washroom, and sat for literally 15 minutes thinking about the things the pub guys would make me do if i told them i had no cash. 1. they'd make me wash the beer glasses - that's okay. 2. they'd makes me wash people's plates - ugh. but still okay. 3. they'd make me sweep and clean the place of cigarette butts, etc. i finally had the sense to call a friend and ask him to come bail me out with some cash. took an hour before he got there and i left as soon as he reached. needless to say, all the high i achieved went down that toilet pot. all because i didn't check my bloody bag before leaving. ps: just got home and hello! my cards were lying on my bed üòû	0

any tips for me (19f) on how to approach this guy (18m)? we work together as counselors at an overnight summer camp and we're in the same friend group, and we're friendly and we joke around, and i do think he's super attractive, but he's also so quiet most of the time that for awhile i thought he just didn't like me all too much. we rarely get one on one time because of short breaks which we all like to spend together as a group and bc of our busy schedules. when we do get rare one on one time i get so far up in my own head thinking he doesn't like me that the quiet just lasts longer. we've had a couple days break over the fourth of july to go home and decompress before another round of campers came in, and it was really nice but i also missed my camp family a lot, considering many of us grew up together as campers and now work on staff. earlier this evening i got a snap from him saying "miss you ‚ù§Ô∏è". i said i missed him too and that i was ready to come back from break and see everyone. i know this is a silly question, but where do i go from here? i've always hated this game of do they like me or don't they. it's absolutely killer to my anxiety and in most of my past relationships i've never been the one to initiate things. it takes a lot out of me to do so and i always feel as if i'm doing it wrong. does anyone have any suggestions on how to ease these nerves and approach something like this the right way? tl:dr; guy i work with at a summer camp is cute, i get really bad nerves trying to initiate anything, and advice on how to do it properly and deal with these nerves would be really appreciated. üíó	0
sad written thingsi keep a digital journal just in case i randomly die... i need people to know that i was not ok and that im still not ok :(. explantion time üëèüëè i am a sad individual. as a kid my parents would only give their praze to my older sibling.... they would talk about how great she was to everyone while i ment nothing to them. i would sit on the side lines while they would talk about how pretty and smart she was. i grew up thinking i was ugly. yeah! tough times. one time my dad out right told me to get up of the couch and give it to my sister cuz she was a girl... my dads abit of a sexist or maybe its cuz i knew about his porn collection still it was abundantly clear to me that i was the least loved in the family. i always tought about killing myself but i never had the balls to try it out.... or did i? dun dun dunnn! on the subject of balls n shit my mom once said i should wear a dress.... :/ (and no it wasnt even this nice but i dont really want to explain my whole life) at one point my mom didnt consider that i was her son just because i implied that she had a boy friend at a family reunion. at that point i already felt like a strange in my own family... so i distanced myself from them. a couple of months ago i drank some detergent as a means to end it all.... and suprice suprice im not dead but at the same time i really did fuck up my throut ( never talked to them about it). i realised some thing that day and that was, that i was scared to die and that im not gonna kill myself. (btw drinking chemicals is never a good way to go... trust me!) if u think i should see a therapist i cant afford it + i cant explain all this to my disfunctional family. im doing honestly better but i need people to know that shit like this happens, maybe even worse. all i know is that having a journal is a greaf way to release stress especially in a case like mine. on that note do u all ever wonder how people would feel if you were to one day die and realise how much pain they caused? cuz i think about that alot and i find peace in the fact they will suffer on the inside for what theyve done. i might sond like an asshole but im being truthful... thus this post. if u made it to the end of this post may you live a long and some what peaceful life cuz death shouldnt be anyones cup of tea. i might have just insulted a couple of people guys that wear dresses. sorry :/ its just that it hurts when your parents do you dirty like that.	1

squirting on an old lady on the metro this happened a few days ago, but i didn't get the chance to post it until now üòÖ my friends and i were looking for fun things to do around shanghai, and one of the easiest forms of travel in shanghai is the metro. after meeting up at a station, we got on a train headed towards a tourist stop and sat down. my friends had eaten breakfast beforehand, but they were nice enough to brought me a few shanghai breakfast items, one of them being xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). however, at that moment i had forgotten that there was soup in the dumpling i was eating, so as soon as i bit into the first dumpling, the hot juice that was trapped inside came bursting out like a doughy pimple, right onto the elderly lady who was sitting in the seat right in front of me. after what seemed like minutes of eyewatering, embarassing eye-contact, i dug out a packet of napkins and wiped off her leg, shamefully returning the rest of my breakfast to its bag for later consumption. tldr; be careful what you put in your mouth in public	0

i'm just so miserable that it's honestly funny üòÇi totally feel so much like shit right now, ngl. it all makes sense now....i've been feeling this dormant pain inside of me every day i came to accept it, only to experience the pain becoming more severe and acute. but it's alright i can withstand it, i can take it all but do you honestly know what is it that i can't take anymore? being a disappointment to people who i do my best for, being a good for nothing even though i put in all my effort and might into everything i do, making people grow tired of me, making people wait even when i do all the work to be on time, making sacrifices for the people i love only to be taken for granted in return, trying my best to make them happy even if i'm not happy, putting so much effort and still be unnoticed.... what i don't comprehend is why do i get to feel this way even though all i do is trying to never do wrong for anyone or anything.... let's speak reality though, all of the above was caused by me. i have brought it all upon myself. i never blamed anyone nor i do blame anyone because this is one hundred percent me, my life and what's become of it. or it might just be my mental health speaking at this point i've got a side of me which has sever depression, anxiety, a self destructive trait, trauma and i don't even know what else do i have but yeah a damaged shitty mental health. whatever it is. all i know is that i need to die. i really wish that i was able to donate my life to someone who actually deserves living rather than being wasted on something like me, but that's just wishful thinking. so yeah after all we are all dying it's the natural process of life. it's just a matter of time being sooner or later. so me taking my leave earlier isn't a bad thing afterall :)	1
blowing out a candle alright so this actually happened about an hour ago and i ended up getting to where i needed to be, and the redness seems to be going away. i still taste and smell it, though. so today my family was getting ready to go to a gathering of sorts and i decided to put on my nice clothes. i have a fair few shirts but i decided to pick one of the more expensive ones. i got everything on, and my mother told me to snuff out the candle we left burning on the dinner table to freshen the area up before we leave. and this is where i forget how things work. i pick up the candle's jar, and realize this jar is a bit deep so i can't use my fingers like i normally do. so i turn it towards myself and i blow. of course, me being a complete fucking bean, blows too hard. not just a little too hard, but like with a force that could make compressed air cans blush (yes i'm bragging about my ability to blow). so now this is where i realize that i'm a complete fucking onion. i'm suddenly blinded, both by wax splattering onto my glasses and into my eyes, and more of the hot, sticky liquid gets all over my face (üòâ). so in a panic as i tilted the jar i spill even more onto my shirt. so after i settle down and head to the washroom to clean it off i realize i'm a complete fucking brick. i had waited for too long and it had all dried up. at this point everyone else was just about ready to leave, brother was in the car waiting, and we were already pushing into late territory because my sister in law was getting ready. i spent a fair bit of time cleaning myself up, lamenting over my shirt, picking dried candle wax from everywhere, and panicking about the redness the hot wax left behind on my face. a fair bit had gotten into my mouth and the back of my throat and dried up, so i rinsed my mouth several times to rid my mouth of the taste, but even now i can smell cinnamon orange spice. i change shirts and end up making everyone about twenty minutes late. tl:dr blew too hard on candle got wax on self and shirt, made family late to event because of cleanup	0

friendly information: what are antitrust laws and anti-competition practices in video games? i've been noticing some discussions again and again that might have these three terms: - antitrust - anti-competition - anti-consumer obviously, everyone's entitled to an opinion. but, opinions are opinions. they are different from facts. so let's discuss facts in this happy, friendly tip. **antitrust laws** [antitrust laws](<url>) have a broad and almost archaic definition nowadays. heck, the first such law, the sherman law, was enacted in 1890 for crying out loud. there have, of course, been additional laws and amendments, including the creation of the federal trade commission or ftc (more on this later). in layman's terms, antitrust laws are designed to protect consumers from abuses of monopolies or unfair methods of competition. there are a handful of major antitrust lawsuits. one big example in tech was the us government versus microsoft (yes, *that* microsoft) back in the 90s. microsoft was accused of having a monopoly on the browser market when they were bundling internet explorer along with windows. well, it turns out, that was a no-no, because competitors such as netscape would be hard-pressed to become an option as a browser. [microsoft actually *lost* this case](<url>), and the original ruling was to break it up into two companies -- one to develop the os, and the other to create additional software. microsoft eventually appealed, and the rest is history. but that was the 90s. some recent examples from the eu, which is notably more aggressive in its handling of antitrust/anti-competition issues, would be: - the eu's [multiple fines levied on google](<url>) due to its abuse of its market share via android, as well as when its own search engine unfairly favored its own services. - the eu's complaint just this april 2019 was regarding [geo-blocked keys](<url>) as a violation of antitrust laws. named in the eu's investigation were five game publishers (bandai namco, capcom, koch media, focus home, and zenimax) and one storefront... *steam.* surprised, eh? *zoinks!* --------- **anti-competition** while antitrust laws are the laws themselves, anti-competition is simply the practice or activity that could cause a violation of those laws. what does this have to do with video games? well, there's a good chance you might've seen a random user who says: "exclusives are anti-competition." but is this user correct? q: what's the stance of the federal trade commission? a: [check it out here.](<url>) q: wtf does that even mean? a: > exclusive contracts can benefit competition in the market by ensuring supply sources or sales outlets, reducing contracting costs, or creating dealer loyalty. as discussed in the fact sheets on dealings in the supply chain, exclusive contracts between manufacturers and suppliers, or between manufacturers and dealers, are generally lawful because they improve competition among the brands of different manufacturers (interbrand competition). however, when the firm using exclusive contracts is a monopolist, the focus shifts to whether those contracts impede efforts of new firms to break into the market or of smaller existing firms to expand their presence. the monopolist might try to impede the entry or expansion of new competitors because that competition would erode its market position. the antitrust laws condemn certain actions of a monopolist that keep rivals out of the market or prevent new products from reaching consumers. the potential for harm to competition from exclusive contracts increases with: (1) the length of the contract term; (2) the more outlets or sources covered; and (3) the fewer alternative outlets or sources not covered. q: seriously, wtf jason? a: it means that exclusives themselves are not anti-competition by nature. in fact, exclusive agreements -- in general -- are a healthy form of competition. i know right? mind blown! it also requires a certain factor -- a [monopolist](<url>) -- and, by definition, a monopolist is one that has a large market share, the lion's share of an industry, preventing newcomers from competing. it means that a company has to do something drastic that rivals cannot even enter the market or competition can no longer exist fairly. exclusive games are, by their very nature, not anti-competition. if that was the case, then there should never have been a single console exclusive (from a third-party developer) since the 80s. but that wasn't what happened historically, right? because those exclusives drove and nurtured healthy competition for decades *in the eyes of the law.* q: what about "aggressive competition?" nobody likes that, right? a: well, actually, the law does. what?!!!!?!!! the [main faq page of the ftc](<url>): > free and open markets are the foundation of a vibrant economy. **aggressive competition** among sellers in an open marketplace gives consumers -- both individuals and businesses -- the benefits of lower prices, higher quality products and services, more choices, and greater innovation. --------- **what about anti-consumer practices?** this one is even more broadly defined. in general, though, these are practices that attempt to mislead, defraud, scam, or outright harm a consumer. are game exclusives anti-consumer? that is debatable, but, again, if that was the case, console exclusives would've been shut down by now, or they should receive a stern talking to from time to time. the removal of the option to purchase a certain good from a certain store doesn't necessarily mean the removal of your right to purchase or consume, because, more than likely, another store is there -- *whether you like that store or not.* the mere fact that you exercise your consumer's right to *not* buy something out of principle, as opposed to being misled or harmed, implies your capability to decide as a consumer. ultimately, though, this last factor is the only point of contention. we are all consumers with different opinions. but, by that very nature, if you like, dislike, or are impartial about something, you are therefore simply protecting your rights as a consumer. if someone likes a store or a game, that's fair, because that's their right as a consumer. you should protect that right if you consider yourself pro-consumer. the same goes for anyone who may dislike the same thing. so long as it doesn't actively seek to mislead, defraud, or harm others, in the eyes of the law, it's fair game. --------- **why the heck did you write this?** for one thing, there were a couple of big earthquakes here in the philippines, and a few aftershocks have been rumbling. manila straddles a major fault line as well. i'm just making sure everything is ready in case of an emergency. plus, i can't sleep since we'll be watching avengers: endgame in the morning -- and no one wants quakes to happen while in a cinema, sigh. second, and perhaps more importantly, it's to prevent misinformation or the lack of awareness when it comes to these terms. far too often, you'll see these buzzwords thrown around. - fun fact: you probably haven't seen any of these terms until recently/in recent years when discussing games. now, rather than using sources like twitter or youtube to learn about these things, my advice would be to use your government agency's website instead. alternatively, check out some transcripts of hearings or ask a lawyer (note, i'm not a lawyer, i just like reading walls of text). otherwise, check out business websites or ask expert market analysts. last but not least, if you do see a user who's throwing these terms around randomly out of the blue, then save this topic and link it back to them. it may provide insight, or it might get them bored. either way, you're using factual information in a discussion about opinions. --------- thanks for reading! üëçüèª	0

[27f] just creeped on my boyfriend's [30m] social media. please tell me im being crazy. so, i knew i shouldn't go down the instagram rabbit hole but here we are. i looked at the pictures my boyfriend has been tagged in (we've been dating a few months). some girl tagged him in a photo last year, right before he moved to where we live now, that was captioned "so my boyfriend is moving üò≠". the picture was a picstitch of them holding hands and a selfie where he's making a duck face. he's very physically affectionate with all his friends, male and female, so the holding hands doesn't seem to weird. he's never mentioned dating someone just before he moved here. for the record, i hadn't even met him when this was posted. i know i'm being crazy, i think it bothers me because she looks super trashy. how can i get over this? i've been obsessing about it and i know i can't ask him about it without revealing i've been stalking him. plus he didn't do anything wrong! tl;dr: boyfriend's possible ex posted a picture of him last year, before i knew him, that's been driving me nuts all morning. please help.	0
man, finding christmas gifts is hard, right? i want everyone i love to know that i love them, and i want to express that by choosing gifts that are personal, thoughtful, and original. and.... so far my parents are getting a kindle case and a bunch of flowers, and my partner is getting a cup of tea and a hug on christmas morning. and don't get me started on trying to write a "christmas list" for myself - what do i want for christmas? a deposit on a house and to be left the fuck alone for the duration üòÜ nah, i'm kidding. i don't want to hate christmas. i just wish this whole run-up period was easier and less stressful.	0

any other guys here sick of peeing in a spray rather than a beautiful straight and steady stream? seriously, this shit has pissed me off to no end. for me, it goes 50% of the time a spray, 30% a hybrid spray/stream, and 20% of the time a perfect straight stream. i don't recommend peeing with a boner or even a half boner if you want to blanket all 4 walls of your bathroom instead of the toilet you're aiming for, but i'm sure most of you already know this. is there any way to fix this shit? üòÇ	0
friendship leading to relationship or just getting stronger ? tl;dr is it worth it to compromise a friendship of years to pursue a relationship with someone if it seems like both parties are interested? dont really know what else to add here i am 25 m and üòÉ is a 21 f okay so i met üòÉ 5 years ago we were both in 4-5 year relationships with other people that both ended last year, mine after hers 8 months ago. okay so i met üòÄ through my ex like they were friends before i even knew her and that was fine the 4 of us ( üòÄs boyfriend of the time ) would all chill together and go to concerts, beach, we were all friends, not the closest freinds maybe we would see them once a month sometimes longer but we always had a good time. anywho, fast forward 4 years this past year was insane we all broke up and stopped hanging out but within a month of me and my ex breaking up ( so 8 months ago ) my ex and her ex started partying and drinking doing coke, which was all pretty wild at the time because i was still freinds with üòÄ and her ex. so huge arguements break out and a couple months pass none of us even live in the same citys anymore. so 3 months ago i moved cities as well and moved in with my sister and guess who she lives literally 10 houses away from ? üòÄüòÄüòÄ. i had no idea i didn't even know what city she lived in. so whatever long story short me and this girl have both been doing the same fun stuff we used to but idk it obviously seems different but i mean it feels really different and we have been seeing each other everyday as freinds she come over to my sisters ( who we helped clean up her place and mental state together ) and she stays every night till at least midnight i'm actually writing this right after she left. so my ex and üòÄs ex who we are pretty sure are screwin and living together caught wind of this and started accusing us of being in an intimate relationship so this was a month ago and since then we've gotten a hell of a lot closer she touches me all the time laughs at literally any stupid joke i make like idk i dont want to sound basic but all the flirtatious things girls do. shes a really shy and awkward girl so the fact i'm picking it up either means i'm completely full of myself or shes trying to get me to notice. idk so my ex and her got in a arguement a couple days ago and üòÄüòÄ said to my ex after a heated exchange of words " maybe i should screw your man and show him how it's done " and more but i'm not gonna repeat it. so they're all mad at each other and üòÄüòÄ shows me her phone and the messages and well like she wasnt trying to hide it. i calm my ex down and the day passes and i walk üòÄhome because honestly since my ex even accused me and her of being together i've thought about it so i've been pretty flirty with her too anyways i talk to her about what she said and i say quote " even if i did like you enough to do something about it, it wouldnt be over revenge of my ex it would be because i genuinely like you as a person and we understand each other so well but these are the exact reasons why i never want to lose you out of my life" referring to her staying as a freind. so i guess everything would be gung ho but me and üòÄ decided before all this crap happened we would move into a place together like we made this agreement as freinds and it was a good plan like we both have mediocre jobs and know hardly anyone else in this city idk. am i being too worrysome? am i being too sensitive towards my ex? idk what direction to try to even go into any advice would be great	0

i'm a compulsive liar and want to die ‚ö†Ô∏èobvious af, but trigger warning.‚ö†Ô∏è also extremely long but if you deal with compulsive lying, depression, being a survivor, or self defeating tendencies read if you're able. i'm basically at the point where i'm trying to get the courage to end it. but i figured i'd reach out if it helps anyone else and share the story that brought me here. first off, i have a compulsion to lie. i can't convince you that this is true but i need to be honest somewhere and i guess an anonymous burner account works. you'll hate me by the end of this and no doubt wish i was dead too. i've been dealing with depression and dysphoria since i was little. i was sexually molested by a teacher/caretaker while i was at daycare (preschool? 4-5 it's kind of a blur.) i was forced to do things to her and other kids. she told us if we told that we'd get in trouble and our family would be in trouble. my father was abusive, physical and emotional. my depression set in at that young age because i was constantly in crisis. probably adrenal fatigue. i had always been attracted to men and women, and didn't feel safe in my skin. i would find out later (just a few years ago in fact) that i'm intersex. i always felt dysphoria about my body and how i looked. felt out of place and disgusting. i lied to sound cool, to try and be a different person, tried to fit in. homeschooled but socialized, i wasn't as much of an outcast as i thought i was, but constantly being dragged down by my own doubt. soon i moved out of the house, went to college at 15 for highschool completion. ended up in an abusive relationship (just call her l). i left that relationship shortly after for a 10 year one (let's call her m) that ended when i realized i wasn't happy ever. my depression caused issues. in that first relationship (with l, i was about 16-17 years old) i tried to commit suicide the first time. during my long term relationship with m, we had issues but nothing terrible at first. it was mostly me being sad and having lack of energy. i lost jobs, stayed in bed. struggling constantly, feeling like a failure and a disappointment constantly. i lied to friends still, but had gotten better. sometime right before i broke up with m, i met someone online that was like a breath of fresh air. we went to comiccon and met her and her boyfriend, some other folks. i confided in her, (again let's call her d) and we hit it off. we were both in struggling relationships and she was in an open one. we were friends first, but flirted a lot. i drifted from m. we fought more, i started cutting and other forms of self harm. to top off this period, i got a great job and lost it because of my depression. soon, i was working in a call center. d asked me if i wanted to attend another con with her and a friend. i agreed, taking out a loan to do so. m wasn't happy about this, because she had a lot of debt (which i happily paid off when i had my good job). but i would risk everything to make d happy. i attended the convention, even though d's mutual friend dropped out. that meant we were staying in an air bnb alone. the first night she confided in me that she felt more than friendship for me, and i was starting to feel the same. d had asked her boyfriend if she could make out with me (since they had an open relationship) but he said no. she disregarded that and soon we were having everything except kissing. we had all kinds of sex (minus penetration) and engaged in kinks and such that m was not interested in. we kissed a lot too, eventually. like young lovers, we said goodbye on our separate ways home. once home, we continued to sext and even skype. she said she'd continue to talk her boyfriend, maybe he would budge and we could be out and open. however i was still with m. this is when i told her that i was feeling we needed to split up. this is also when i started lying again. it's also where i became a monster that truly deserved death. d told me that her boyfriend had seen our romantic texts and flew off the handle. he said she needed to stop (one of their major issues was he could bang whoever but she had to check in with him basically). we stopped for a bit but she continued to come back to the romantic and sexual stuff. i knew in my messed up head we might have a chance, so i went along. i had been through some serious health issues, and d started to confide that she had more kinds of feelings for me. we were romantic, best friends, soul mates. after treatment, i continued to say that my illness was worse. m was heartbroken. i had no job, not even the terrible one. i went to d's state for a job interview, where we promptly met and had sex. m meanwhile could no doubt see the writing on the wall. i didn't get the job. but i said i did. i couldn't stop myself from lying. it began getting worse. both women thought i had a job and would be moving to d's state. once there, i continued looking for a job, and had no luck. i continued to engage in sexual contact with d, and mooching money off of family. i felt awful but i truly loved d. she said she loved me. then one night, she told me that her boyfriend had made up with her and that she knew we'd never have a legit relationship. not open/poly, and she wouldn't leave him. she told me i'd probably grow to hate her eventually. i was broken. (this whole time i was on strong psych meds for the first time ever. celexa, wellbutrin, and topimax. plus a weight loss drug that's basically speed- the phen in phenfen. all prescribed of course) after d told me she couldn't be with me, i started looking for dates in earnest. m and i had broken up and now my soul mate was gone. i told her i got even sicker so she'd stay, but she continued having sexual encounters and got distant. i met a woman (let's call her v) this woman was wild. scary, but in the exciting way. soon after our first date, we hooked up. i told her the same stories i was telling d, because i couldn't stop at this point. i was sick, in my lies and (mentally) in reality. she told me she loved me that second night. she looked me in the eyes and said "i claim people. you know my friend x? she's mine. and now so are you." and it was scary but it felt so very good to be loved. i told her i loved her too. she started coming over unannounced bringing large amounts of weed (which is illegal in their state) and i lied lore and said i smoked it. which i didn't, i had barely been a drinker even up until that point. not straight edge, but damn if i was going to let go of my faculties. d got jealous. she knew about me and v, because we were still friends at this point. we even had full passionate sex, the kind that we'd been talking about for a while. soul connection, but with a hit of sadness to come. i know now that was probably goodbye sex, as soon after (on valentines day) she came out with the truth to her boyfriend. they made up, and i tried to kill myself then. losing my best friend and lover, being scared of v and unsure why i was still so far from home and the woman who loved me (m, my best friend of ten years). i threw away almost everything i had and swallowed a ton of pills. i woke up to them puked all over the place. i decided it was time to go home. i told v my mother was sick, because frankly i thought she might hurt me or something. i had just attempted suicide and it was raw. i needed to leave and the lying was rolling out. d wondered why i was leaving so suddenly. she began to question my stories, about the continued illness, money i had given her etc. basically everything that could unravel at that point, came apart like a walmart rug. i lied at first but admitted everything. i told her yes when she asked and when questioned as to why i lied i had no answer. i could only try to backpedal not knowing the cliff behind me was one i'd dug myself. she swore she hated me and said never contact her again. i even admitted to things that were actually true but i couldn't stand to lose her. trying to impress had been what got me in this mess, feeling no self worth. soon i got back to my home state. i received a text from v, saying she knew my mother was fine. now i know d had gone on a rampage, telling all of our mutual friends that i was a liar and digging up some she didn't know but she felt she needed to tell them all the same. i believe that's how v found out. she said i 'revenge of the nerds' raped her. she called me every horrible name. i just had to agree. i hated myself and three people who had loved me had turned to hating me in two months. i didn't lie about my heart or who i was, but i took what she said and put it inside me. even if that isn't rape, someone i cared about went through what i did when i was little. they felt that hatred i once felt toward the woman at my daycare. i got a job almost immediately upon return, stayed wit the same family i had used their money to survive. i felt awful. one night after work, i tried meeting up with someone. i needed to be assured i wasn't he monster i actual was. after her telling me she thought i was lying about something, i tried to confide in her that i had been a liar, felt awful. i had lied to her about having money i didn't have, despite her having money. just a stupid lie. but she wanted nothing to do with me. so i checked myself into the hospital, after nearly jumping in front of a train. what awaited me wasn't mental help, or understanding, or even the ability to tell anyone. they locked me in a cement room with a paper gown and threatened to put me in an institution. i got picked up after 72 hours and went home. soon after, i lost this brand new job with its new lease on life. lost my apartment. one last romantic encounter. i thought i was such scum. i decided to treat people nice, spend all my money and time to try and get love. i met a girl who genuinely was full of life and energy. we went home and (uhoh) basically fell in love after one night of sex. you see the pattern of love addiction i'm sure! we had a great first month together, i felt like living again. truly a good time, and i loved her as much as i had m for those first few years. let's call her t. t and i moved out, i got a job, spent all of my time, energy, and money on her. but i soon lied about how much money i had. i could see he writing on the wall. i tried to tell her and be honest, but i lied over and over. she'd ask me about it, and i would just confess. not sure why i had lied, why i was scared to tell her the truth. but i was. eventually she had got a breaking point. i decided i was a monster and needed to just finish what i'd tried so many times. i told her to go to her moms house, to leave. she called the police, despite me wanting to do it after she left she just knew what i was thing to do. i was going to drown myself in the bathtub with sleeping pills in my system or finally jump in front of that train. but instead, the police showed up, shoved me into cuffs and i spent another three days in a concrete room. i was planning on leaving and doing it after. but t came back. she forgave me, and said i would need to prove to her i could stop lying and be a good person. i agreed, but i still felt like a monster. it wasn't long before i did it again. being intersex meant it was nearly impossible for me to get anyone pregnant. they told me i was essentially sterile. t had had a miscarriage in the past. she knew conceiving would be nearly impossible for her too, but she desperately wanted kids. so did i, but knew it wouldn't be easy or likely. in a million to one chance, we became expecting parents. she was pregnant and we were elated. things were good. but we soon received the news that she had miscarried, right at the end of the first trimester. i took off time from work, sinking back to my lowest depression. this effected my job, (again) and i was let go. in the meantime, i lied about my pto and just took care of t. when she found out, this time she left. rightfully so. i got a job, and moved and basically reset again. missing t terribly all the while, having her tell me how much she wished we could be together. i knew i couldn't stop lying. i knew should've stopped talking to her. now i'm teetering on the edge, having lost everyone i care about, disappointed my family, and truly understand the only way to make sure no one is hurt by me again is to remove the problem: me. if i didn't exist none of this would be here. i can make sure i never hurt anyone again, if i can grow the courage to end it. either way, please heed my story. if you're any sort of compulsive liar, narcissist, or something similar please- i'm begging you get help, come out of the dark, and tell the goddamn truth. edited for clarity, be good to each other so long all- b	1

peeing in the lake my family owns some land and it contains a man made lake. it is stocked with sunfish and bass. yesterday was super hot, so i decided to go for a swim. when i felt the urge to go, i thought, might as well. not wanting soil my suit, i pulled out my unit and began. just as i was finishing, i received some unwanted nibbles on my pecker. i noped out of that lake not quite as fast as the flash. side note: this made me think the fish might be hungry. so i got my pole, and cast out quite a few. didn't catch shit, and lost my lure in the weeds. since this post isn't long enough for this subreddit, i thought i'd share some background info. 30 years ago, my grandpa bought 80 acres of land, dug out this lake, and stocked it with fish. my dad built my grandparents house, which he purchased from them a few years ago, as they are getting older and can't maintain the land. i hope you found that interestingüòú. tl;dr i peed in the lake, a fish chewed on my penis.	0

girl with heavily suicidal gf back at it again tw/ suicide üòï hi again. my girlfriend is heavily depressed/ suicidal and i'm not sure how to deal with it. she's probably the most important thing in my life, so it's really scary when she randomly tells me that she wants to kill herself and stuff. i ask her to vent to me, but she says i'm too unstable for that. fair enough. she would get a therapist, but her mom is shitty and won't let her. (are minors allowed to get therapists in canada without a parents consent?) she hasn't gone on her meds for years (bpd/depression) because of the side effects. and with covid, all i can really do is text or phone her, which i do almost constantly. does anyone have any advice to encourage her to open up, if there's anything i should mention to her, or just generally how to deal with a suicidal gf? i knwo this is kinda general but this has really been stressing me out lately, and what better place to go than r/teenagers	0

last night (my story)last night i took 30 midol pills. expecting to just die i climbed into bed. then it hit. at this point i regretted it. i called poison control and told them i didn't want to die after all. i was seeing yellow. my vision was so dizzy. i felt high. hour one was alright. hour two i felt tired. by hour 5 i couldn't drink anything. hour 8 is when it got bad. the chills made me strip and lay on the bathroom floor. then the pain started. i tried everything, to pee, too puke. to bring everything up. nothing worked. i sat there crying out to god that i was sorry. that i didn't want to die. that i wanted to be there for my boy (my cat üòÖ). i guess he heard me. i got a wave of dizziness. i fell off the toilet before getting the worst pain of my life. but also the best pain. i vomited all over the floor. on my hands and knees like an animal. i felt some relief. i thought it was over. by 11 i was throwing up in my bed. i felt pain everywhere. by now i regretted even taking the pills. i'd always been a rational person. but today i felt so low and alone i thought i was sure that this was what i wanted. i had never been more wrong. i feel asleep around 2? 3? desperately trying to get comfortable. to the people that talked to me yesterday on this app, thank you. you may not have changed my mind before i took the pills. but your words stayed with me. and i probably wouldn't have died from these pills. but this is my story. suicide isn't worth it. i know that now. thank you to all who were on my side.	1
i've never wanted someone dead, apart from right now. a little 13 year old kid in reading was killed yesterday by a boy names jonjo, i've followed the story from a few hours after it came out, found jonjo's instagram, messaged his mates, and this kid is pure scum, there are bad people on this planet, but this kid offers nothing good. i'm pretty useles, one of the only things i'm good at is making ppl laugh, but jonjo is pure scum and the video of the stabbing angers me a lot because it happened in the posh town of reading, near london. and i'm poor af, this was a kid who had wealthy parents, a nice house (i found his address) but he went to go stab an innocent 13 year old boy over some girl. i wouldn't be unhappy at all if he died. eye for an eye. but i want it to be slow and painful. if u wanna see the video dm me. it's pretty horrific especially with all the people standing around doing nothing. rip olly stephans ‚ù§Ô∏èüïäÔ∏è	0

wish getting help was easierthis is my first post on here i don't use reddit really often. i am someone who's been suicidal since 4th grade. i am 21 and although some aspects of my life have gotten easier other aspects are breaking me. i have been hospitalized both inpatient and outpatient help. i wish there was a way to get help and be honest without repercussions of being "locked up". mental hospitals have never helped me and if anything they just took away my dignity and made me feel i had to lie about how i feel. i feel stuck a part me wants to seek help again but the other part knows the path that leads me on. thanks for hearing me vent üòî	1

hunter x hunter has way to many anti-lgbt fans for being like one of the biggest mainstream animes with gay and transgender characters in it like literally any fan theory and people accept the possibility of it. except if you mention the possibility of gon and killua being gay/bisexual then they will freak out and say they're 100% straight, and they're too young to know what being gay is (but they can know they're straight üòê). and there's literally so many clues that suggest it's possible that they are in love more than just friends. plus it's just fucking cute to think about it, like if someone wants to ship them and make their fan stories about them then like wtf why not. and the fact they never have a problem with shipping male + female characters who weren't canonically in love. but then there's a problem if they're gay. that's pure homophobia.	0

[opinion] i seriously do not understand why ps4 exclusives receive so much praise everytime sony, or the ps4 is brought up on reddit, or youtube, i hear nothing but "man, sony has killed it this generation!" (no praise to the devs who made the games here? just the corporation that lets them do it? it's like saying feminism should be credited to men, because men let women vote.) or "these exclusives are some of the best games i've played in a decade." i've played the following ps4 exclusives: - god of war iv - persona 5 - horizon zero dawn - bloodborne - the last of us - uncharted 4 in other words, the most praised ones. aside from spider-man, because i'm going to wait on that one a bit after being disappointed by god of war iv, and persona 5 (preordered gow4, and persona 5 for ps4 and ps3). keep in mind that i'm only talking exclusives: not multiplats. of all the games listed, only 1 has failed to disappoint. bloodborne. mainly due to the atmosphere, art direction, gameplay, combat, and customization, even if i think there could be more build variety. other than that, just about everything else i've mentioned has been hugely disappointing in some way to me. god of war iv's combat was seriously overhyped. no, it's not like dark souls or bloodborne in the least: the only similarities are that they have the same control scheme. camera's way too close, a lot of enemies are spongy, and dodging feels extraordinarily clumsy. it also seriously lacked in enemy variety. what a shame, since they had all of norse mythology at their fingertips. they could've used nidhoggr, or sleipnir in boss battles. they even showed hresvelgr, but... he was just a background prop. would've been pretty interesting to fight him. in other words, i don't think the game uses the full potential or norse mythology to it's advantage for enemy variety and art direction. as for the writing, it's not bad, but at the same time, it's got that sort of "your princess is in another castle" problem, where whenever they reach their apparent objective, oop, nope, it ain't over, because x happens. persona 5 had dungeons that could be good at times. however, at other times, they ended up being samey-samey mazey corridors, that feel less like i'm exploring them, but more like i'm taking the longest route possible from point a to b. as for writing, i'm actually baffled at how poorly the game handles it's messages. beating us over the head with the palace's symbolism without letting the player figure it out for themselves, it handles it's subject matter with little to no nuance after kamoshida, and constantly undermines it's own themes (presenting the phantom thieves as 100% right even though it claims that they are morally grey‚Ñ¢Ô∏è). as for the characters, i kind of just found them annoying. and most of them don't even do shit for the story after their arc. also, if character development doesn't do anything for the story, then fuck off. it's ultimately a game that thinks it's being super clever, but in reality, it's incredibly oversimplified and dumbed-down. horizon zero dawn. holy shit. i said i didn't like p5's characters, but at least they had some personality, and i can remember their fucking names. the only characters i remember from horizon were aloy, rost, and sylens. and even then, i seriously don't get why aloy is so highly praised! she has a cool character design, and a mildly interesting origin, but that's it! she is such a goddamn boring character. also, i don't care about what's happening now with hades, or some idiot conspiracy with the shadow carja. i want to actually play as the dudes during the apocalypse, since that's the only interesting part! also the gameplay. it's good on paper, but perhaps it was just me, but i'm really used to mouse and keyboard aiming, so it kind of felt clunky, with some horrendous melee combat, and the open world is just... meh. tedious side quests without interesting stories, or, thanks to the healing system, i have to constantly scrounge around, and look for medicine. to give you some perspective into how bland i found the characters, i literally can say more about a side quest character in ac odyssey, on my, what, 20 hour playtime so far, than i can say about most of the cast in hzd after 35 hours. the last of us has some solid, character writing, and not to mention that the sound design is quite good as well. unfortunately, that's plagued with generic third person action gameplay, and isn't very scary or tense. not to mention that there is literally nothing i haven't seen before in the game: serious dad trying to protect kid or kid surrogate? check. seen that before in bioshock infinite, and walking dead. cinematic cover-based over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter with stealth elements? 3 of naughty dog's games on the ps3, horizon zero dawn, spec ops: the line, gears of war, max payne, etc. etc. to be fair though, cliches aren't inherently a problem unless done poorly: hero academia proves that things can be cliche, yet still great. uncharted 4: pretty much the same as the last of us, but with even less stakes, and worse writing. gameplay's a bit better, but with a few things, like a grappling hook mechanic, and whatnot, so i suppose that's an improvement, but not by much. what sucks about all of this for me, is that, on paper, a lot of these games have what i want. god of war 4's a semi-open world with 3rd person melee based combat with great graphics, with a huge emphasis on story and characters, all based on norse mythology? sounds awesome. horizon is a sprawling open world with tons of different environments, post-apocalyptic, a unique aesthetic, based around killing robot dinosaurs? hell yeah. persona 5 is a character-driven jrpg that covers taboo subjects, and has an awesome, comic-book aesthetic? that's neat. hell, spider-man also has what i want. based on my favourite superhero of all time, with arkham-style combat, featuring a huge selection of classic comicbook villains, set in an open world of new york, where we can swing around as we please. but i am, extremely cautious about that game. can someone explain why people like these games so much, claim they set a new standard for video games, and praise the everliving fuck out of them? maybe my expectations were unreasonable, and i should play them again without any comparison to other games i liked?	0

my friend coincidentally texted to hang out when i was feeling sad. good timing! i woke and cried a lil bit because my crush is ignoring me. he's being weird and distant. he lives in another city and is seeing our favorite band this weekend. he hasn't mentioned it either. :/ anyways coincidentally, my friend texted at the same time to see if i'd like to hang out at this ramen place tomorrow ‚ò∫Ô∏è although my friend hasn't replied yet with a time, he'll never know what a good coincidence it was!! üòÇ i don't tell anyone about my romantic life. do you guys do this too?	0
you know what's really sad... few weeks ago when i was on camp and was just hanging out with (supposedly straight) guys i was supposed to sleep with in a tent. we were just playing around, them acting very gay-like (which i appreciate since i'm gay) while i'm just there like "okay". everything was fine before the topic of gays came up. this dude was like "what do you think of gays?" i expected positive answers considering how they were acting that night but instead, got the worst possible results ever. they all agreed that they should all belong in hell. at that moment my heart broke. why? wtf was wrong with them? i slightly tried to hint arguments against their statement, but only slightly as to not accidentally out myself. no avail. they then quickly moved on to another topic because the atmosphere was getting quite heavy. to this day they still act gay, and tbh i'm kinda attracted to this one guy. he occasionally gives me hugs and tells me pick up lines (then i tell them one back in an instant because i keep some in my head) but i'm ***pretty sure*** he is straight. but that's my dilemma, i don't know if any of them are actually gay, it's just so hard to read guys when they are acting so gay. idk why every guy in high school acts so gay. at least they can't read me back. anyway, please send help. this guy just doesn't want to leave my mind. he's got, cute, funny, a great hugger, cute, funny, has a great personality and i feel like i wanna be with him forever. he is the only person who has made me felt this way since my previous rejection. help. i'm trying to keep options but god fucking damn it. being gay is hard üòû .	0

my boyfriend and his family openly live with spiders üëÄ my boyfriend and his family have a few rather large spiders that they share their house with. the spiders never come down from their cozy nests in the corners of the ceiling, except in the wee hours of the night. he says he's pretty sure they've been there for at least 10 years (do spiders even live that long?), and they've pretty much become a part of the family. while one part of me finds this to be a really neat and natural way to be accepting of nature, the other part of me can't help but scream, "wtf," every time i see one of them moving around in the corner. i know there are almost definitely spiders lurking around in my house too, and they're doing great spider things (like eating other bugs), but i never actually see them! something about that gives me more comfort than actually seeing them. do you like seeing the bug friends in your house?	0

your boy did it! over the last 2 years, i had a pretty terrible period in my life. was very depressed, had horrible thoughts and i was very underweight. also had a bunch of anxiety, felt like a weirdo, etc etc. i started working out and eating properly, making an effort to be more social etc. it helped immensely on my mental health, and i've gained ~11kg of lean mass since, and around 2 tons of friends if you combine their weight. (lol) this year i went to boarding school, and on 9/11 i kissed a girl for the first time, and we've been together for 5 months now. for the first time in my life, i have a valentine and am genuinely happy :) you can do it too ‚ù§Ô∏è	0

my bf [21] beat my dog after pulling him out from under the bed by his tail/legs and was lunged at. we've been living together for a year and recently i've found myself feeling like an idiot. "fool me once" type of situation. i'd say we have 75% great times but the rest is definitely worse than bad. as a bit of backstory, my partner cares very much about how his family percieve him and so when they first came to visit he opened the front door to welcome them inside as he didn't want to keep them waiting. i was shouting no repeatedly as i didn't have a hold of my dog (his gran has hip problems, i didn't want the dog knocking her over) and my dog ran out to greet them, ran straight onto the street and was clipped by a car. not only did my partner not bother to listen to me he also didn't care for his gran potentionally being knocked off balance or my dog getting out onto the street. anyway, after being clipped by a car my dog was spooked and ran off, we finally caught him, put a lead on him and walked him home during which my partner kept yanking on the lead and pulling his head onto his knee and lashed out at me when i told him to hand him back as he was being too rough. he called him a stupid dog for not listening and running off etc, i told him he was just excited there was new people and unfortunately he was already out by that point, it wasn't his fault it was my partner's fault for not listening. we moved on and he swore he'd never do it again. until last night, we were in bed and heard pup under the bed rustling around. bf leans down to pull him out and i look over to see him physically shaking with exertion of pulling at him and hear pup growling. lots of noise and yelping so i called at him to stop and at that point pup lunges at him and supposedly bites him. he was under the bed, there are no bite marks, he hasn't broken skin or bruised him, i really think he just lunged and mouthed at him out of fear/discomfort. pup immediately crawls out my side of the bed and cowers behind me, bf storms over and wallops him. he's a collie dog, he's not a small dog and he fully recoils. bf is still mad and comes at him a second time but pup yelps and lunges again. again, no contact just a lot of defense tactics. i was absolutely disgusted by the exchange and the more i replay it in my head the more repulsed i am by my partner. if my dog was my child and bf was step father, would he punish my child for drawing on the wall by smacking him rather than explaining not to draw on the walls? i feel so heart broken, and helpless. as he swears it will never happen again, but this is already the second time it's happened and i feel like a fool for giving a second chance never mind a third. but i also feel like maybe i would be a fool to throw away something that is great the majority of the time for something that may not happen again? i'm just scared to give him that third chance. me and pup are staying at my parents at the moment, but it's not a long term thing so i feel i have to make up my mind. i just don't know what to do. this week has also been a very difficult week after having to give my foster brother some difficult news about his biological family and myself being diagnosed with a precancerous autoimmune disease. so i don't feel like i'm handling any of it very well and don't want to end my relationship just because i didn't handle the news well or something. please send help ‚ù§Ô∏è tl;dr my partner lashed out at my dog after letting him out on the street by accident and swore he'd never hit him again. proceeded to beat him months later after being lunged at for pulling him out from under the bed by his legs/tail.	0

my (22m) friend (21m) ghosts me, reconnects, then turns sour. i have no idea whats going on with him or what i should do? i'm 22m hes 21m. we met at the gym. we are not gym buddies but sometimes we are there same time so we talk. weve been friends for 4 months now. we've always been nice to each other however, one thing i've noticed are his mood swings. something i've noticed since ive seen him in the gym (before we started talking). on some days he is in a good mood and is sociable but on some days, hes cold and wont reply much. this november, the latter has been more frequent. id get scanty replies be it through text or face to face, and i dont think anyone would like that. id ask if hes ok and hed say the generic response "im fine" he has never shown any signs that he does not like me. as a matter of fact, its the opposite (as a friend). * if we havent seen each other in a week and then we do, hed say something like "its good to see you i havent seen you in a while.' * on some occasion he seems happy to see me and looks upset when i leave. he also shows moderate forms of affection (see below) * we went from fist bumps to handshakes to those brohug handshakes (which he was the first to start doing). mid november on one occasion, he pat me on the waist when he said goodbye to me. that might seem like a small matter...but its a bit 'romantic' for a dude to do that to another - although im not bothered by it. and definitely you wont do that to someone you dont like from mid november onwards he has been a bit cold and his bad days were more frequent. hed reply me with one word up front and gets annoyed when i try talking to him. at one point he even snapped when i asked a question. he had gone sour with me all of a sudden. i confronted him through text that eventhough i apologized for the question, i shouldve recieved one for being snapped at. and since he has no interest in talking to me lately, i wont be talking to him. i got no response. a week+ later i realize everyone makes mistakes and have bad days, and i shouldnt retaliate at the first mistake especially since he has been nice to me in the past. i send an apology for retaliating (eventhough i deserve one) because i dont want to make things worse for him. still no response. eventually i meet him at the gym and we do that brohug thing...as if weve moved forward. i ask to talk to him after hes done working out and he said ok. he didnt. he went straight home and sent me a text saying he doesnt want to talk and goes to the gym just to workout and only that (not to talk). seeing how we might not talk anymore, i told him how i felt. how ive always felt like hes going through something because i noticed the mood swings. told him he can still talk to me if he needs someone to talk to, and if he doesnt want to talk to me, talk to someone, because bottling things are bad. no response also. we havent blocked each other. and at no point have we attacked each other personally. im a bit worried about his wellbeing and quite upset that i may have lost a friend. my fear is that stress and anxiety (atleast) are getting to him. eventually we bumped into each other at christmas day and we wished each other a merry christmas. however, the rest of the day he avoided eye contact and the bad vibes were still there. three weeks afterwards we bump i to each other and this time he initiates. he waves at me from a far, and sooner he actually came up to me and started having a convo. it was a good convo, good vibes. a few weeks later (havent seen him since ‚òùüèº) i follow him on his unprivate instagram but no follow back. im utterly confused at his behaviour. does he want to be friends or not? furthermore i am leaving the state soon (for a very long time) and i have not seen him since. i want to text him asking if hes ok...but i feel unwelcomed to do that...but a part of me thinks "how worse can things get already?" and i should send him a text anyways...really dont know what to do he has mentioned his family has it difficult sometimes because they have so much things to pay (insurances, their schooling and etc) and i think he might be struggling. he has also just finished college (which he said is difficult to pay for). 2 weeks after finishing college and hes already frustrated about having to find work (he seems to really need it). i dont know if that is enough to assume someone is having a hard time. finances are a big thing. can these (and perhaps some other stuff) be affecting his behaviour? i am worried...although we may never speak to each other again. tl;dr friend turns cold, then reconnects, then cold again	0

the smug style in american game diversity (you don't need a black guy in medieval bohemia) yeah i stole that title from [emmett rensin](<url>). for a while now there has been a big push and subsequent reaction for more diversity in video game characters. and it's one of those internet flame wars what always felt particularly annoying to me because the reactionary cries of "evil sjw infiltrating our games" are insufferable and as a dude in the left i would be expected to side with the opposite side, but the myopic approach of the woke‚Ñ¢Ô∏è gaming press and 'murica-centric liberals that *yass queen* at them makes me unable to do so. #part 1: "suspension of disbelief" or "where did that brown dude came from?" one of the reasons why this push for diversity whiting and outside the industry is annoying to watch is because for the most part it feels like exactly what it is: soulless marketing. a group of business men in a conference room using the words "target demographic" a lot, decided that the game needed more diversity and that resulted in the final product. i don't think any game gave me more of that feeling than *dragon age inquisition*. now, dai isn't the most diverse game i have played, but it's the most *artificially* diverse one. for those who don't know, a lot of dai takes place in a kingdom called ferelden, a backwards, barbarian, proto-nationalist land infected with racism that forces minorities into ghettos. not that you would know that from being there, because if the game overworld is to be believed the entire place is actually a renaissance fair being held in queens ny. the issue at hand here is the artificiality of all, all of this could have being accomplished in a better way, and i know that because *the elder scrolls* does so. if i see a black man walking down the road in skyrim and ask myself "where did he come from?" i can answer that with many hypotheticals. maybe he is a sellsword who crossed from hammerfell to take advantage of the war, maybe he is a refugee form the chaotic situation on his homeland, or maybe he is a former member of the imperial legion who deserted. if i ask myself the same question while playing dai i can only give one answer: because some dude in a suit said "this test well with the 18-25 year old demographic". to reduce the diversity of man to a marketing strategy is unpleasant, because then said diversity will only exist as far as it helps sell something. the issue will only exist or be tackle in safe ways that, whatever target demographics the men in suits chose, will find tolerable. no boundary will be pushed, no statement will be daring. the society of the spectacle is all that remains. and this is basically an unavoidability in any mass produced piece of capitalist media, but i would rather be fooled by todd howard to believe otherwise for a few hours than sit throw dai which refuses to even dissimulate what it is doing. #part 2: "brooklyn diversity" or "eurocentrism, but woke‚Ñ¢Ô∏è" have you guys ever heard of afrocentrism? those weird black dudes who insist that a myriad of european historical figures, from mozart to isabella i of castile, were actually black because reasons? such quirky folks. anyway, that's pretty much how a lot of games approach the subject of worldbuilding. take the same old setting traditionally filled with white dudes and just spray non-white non-dudes at random. that's how you end with generic medieval europe magic land but with black people in it, and anglo-saxon battalion in ww2 but with women in it. this is a type of diversity that i usually call "brooklyn diversity", mostly because i don't know what else to call it. diversity as imagined by some white chick from brooklyn who dated a black dude once but only to anger her parents. or in less snarky terms: diversity as understood from an aggressively us-centric view of the world. diversity is not "fulani, hausa, yoruba and igbo" nor "german, poles, hungarians and serbians". diversity is only understood as the categories made by a myopic us worldview, which is "whites and people of color". that dreaded pigeonholed "people of color", the ones that need "representation" and everything is ok as long as the "poc get representation". the fundamental flaw in this worldview was never more blatant than in the controversy surrounding *kingdom come: deliverance* and its lack of "diversity". of course *kingdom come* hardly lacks diversity, there is a myriad of ethnic groups portrayed in it. but that's not what the american woke‚Ñ¢Ô∏è commentator wants, the american woke‚Ñ¢Ô∏è commentator wants brooklyn diversity, they want the "poc", actual demographics of medieval bohemia be dammed. of course they don't specify what "poc" they want, because they are all interchangeable, and if some random arab had showed up in 15th century sazava that would absolutely count as enough representation and all poc of the world would have rejoice about how much representation there was in the game now. ultimately that's the ideal for the american call for game diversity. a familiar homogenized and first world western friendly setting, splattered with enough poc to fill the diversity quota. and the entire world should be satisfied with that. i am not satisfied with that.	0

did you keep your suicide clothes?i am in a much better state now, almost neutral sometime even happy. sometimes i fall into depersonalization, which sucks. but hey... could be much worse. around two years ago on the 25th of april 2016 i attempted suicide by ingesting over 60 pills (including depression medication). i didn't die, obviously, but funny enough know one knows to this day i actually attempted it (woke up after 40 hours or so with vomit and feeling dizzy/weird). i still have the clothes in which i attempted it though. it was my guy best friend's abercrombie grey shirt (which is super comfy) and my favorite pj plaid bottoms i lost a while ago. i wore the shirt again for a while but my depression got worse (didn't leave the house for more than 8 months). now that i am finally doing better i wonder if i should throw it away. haven't worn it in a while (since things have gotten better), but it's so comfy sometimes i want to wear it just for that. then i remember "the day" and am scared it will happen again if i wear it and settle for something else. should i keep it in a box as memorabilia and just never wear it, or should i wear it and stop being superstitious. should i straight up just give it away? did any of you go through similar things keeping items from "the day?" tia üß°	1

no drugs where harmed in the making of this episode ive never posted on reddit before. but i decided this time i wanted to share, im thankful to anyone just reading this :* ok. im going to try and put in written word what ive just spent fifteen minutes explaining to myself out loud. im going to try and stick to exactly what i said. it started with thinking about my relationship with üôä, trying to put into words what it was, what it meant. and of course as usual lately i couldnt. i realised i didnt want to talk about him anymore, when before i was dying to talk about him to anyone i met. now the only things that come to mind to talk about him are stigmas or labels, superficial and fake. so i cant, wont talk about him. i realised at that point that i was the only one trying to come up with a story, anything to talk about him accurately. that this wasnt at all a concern of his. that what i thought was over had actually occurred once again: i was going through experiences, life, alone. that anything i went through when i was a kid i was always alone in that feeling, that experience, that moment. and i would have thought that would change the day i went through an experience you cant possible go through alone: a relationship. it takes two people to share a relationship, to make every step forward, or backward. yet somehow i found myself going through it alone, in the end, being alone in a relationship that didnt mean anything to the other person anymore. i then realised that i was condemned to spending life and experiences alone. that i could share them with people, but ultimately everything i felt i would always feel alone, would never be able to feel the true communion of my feelings with those of another person. the one time i shouldve, it only lasted for the blink of an eye. and was probably an illusion to begin with, that shattered when he left. i started realising that i now knew how my life was going to end, and exactly how i was going to go through life. the only thing i couldnt know in advance were the minute moments in between the chapters in my life where i would feel alive and like anything could happen. a few seconds in a day, a few hours in a month, a few weeks in a year. 2 weeks. was that enough? enough to hold onto, to look forward to in an otherwise open book? what was the point, in the end? whats the point. i dont see these thoughts as suicidal. i feel like my mind has opened up at 360 degrees, that i see everything, know everything. im not sad, specifically. yes im sad, generally speaking, but not specifically. im scared that ive already made up my mind. im scared that i dont have a say in my own life. i dont want to die. i dont want to grow tired of trying, and give up at 28. im scared ive made up my mind. im not too lazy to live, i just know there's no point in trying. because there's something wrong with me and ive been taking the side path my entire life when everyone else has been on the main road	1

accidentally showing my boss a titty pic of myself this happened about an hour ago and i'm just trying to play "dumb & blonde" at this point. just for context, my boss is an older lady, late 50s, kinda conservative, but overall a nice and chill person. we chat a lot, since we are the only girls in the office and get along really well- i'm her administrative assistant and she is the office manager and owns half the company. so needless to say, i always try to maintain a very business professional demeanor at work and keep a good impression going. so, this morning we are talking about my daughter and i was telling her about a paint project she (my daughter) did on sunday. i realize i have a picture in my phone and whip it out to show my boss (b). i find it quickly and hand my phone to b, while glancing over her shoulder. well.... apparently on iphones, it shows recently sent/received photos in a bottom window of the picture gallery. guess who sent their boyfriend a tit pic yesterday...? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è well i spot it immediately, because there's these little mini pictures at the bottom of the screen with some giant ass titties front and center. i go to grab my phone, but i know i wasn't quick enough because i can (slow motion style) see her glance from the open pic of my daughter while smiling, down to the üçà üçà melons- instant awkward face. üôÉ so now i'm just trying to play it off like i had no idea she saw it. i want to crawl into a hole and disappear- definitely taking a half day at lunch. üò≠ roast me to make me laugh reddit? üò≠ tl;dr tifu by trying to show my boss a pic of my daughter, but accidentally also showing her a tit pic of myself.	0
‚ö†Ô∏è trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏èi don't know if there is a point to putting a trigger warning but just in case it stops a person from being triggered then i will do it anyway i'm going to kill myself next week. thursday to be exact or at least i think it will be thursday i guess i won't know until i get to that day. i'm f17 and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what i should do with my last week? i've already had my favourite foods and i've made an instagram of all my memories and experiences so that they won't all be for nothing and other people will be able to remember who i was. i need to clean my room but it's such a mess it's overwhelming to even think about starting to clean it but i know i must because otherwise my family will be left to clean it up after i am gone. i've already told camhs (a uk mental health service) and my school about my suicide plan. camhs haven't done anything i haven't really heard back from them since i told them and my school introduced me to a safeguard person but that's it. i just thought i would add that so you guys know that i'm trying to get help before i die if only just so i can say 100% confidently that i tried. anyway i don't want to be depressing or cringey i was just wondering if there is anything i can do to make my last week exciting? i suppose? basically just a bucket list of things to do before i die :)	1

getting a hickey for the first time at 21y/o obligatory; i still have the hickey but i was given it two days ago. i met up with this guy from tinder because i don't have time for a relationship, work two jobs and full time school. sexy times ensued, i noticed he was spending a lot of time on my neck. i asked him not to give me a hickey, as i was going home from college the next day. welp. it's dark purple. i concealed it the best i could. barely recognizable unless you're looking for it. came home at 12am last night, parents were sleeping. awesome. left concealer on in hopes they wouldn't notice incase they came into my room in the morning. fail. i guess while i was tossing and turning in the night it rubbed off. i heard my mom come in around 7am. i was still sleeping but i tried to roll over and hide it out of fear. she saw it. she gasped and i felt her lean closer. she definitely saw it. i woke up and put more concealer on. i went downstairs and my mom is not talking to me. this is the first time i've ever gotten a bad hickey. at 21! i have a feeling i'm grounded. üòÖ tl;dr got a hickey from tinder date. went home next day. mom saw. grounded?	0

my partner wants me to throw out my bed because my ex slept in it. hey all, my partner and i are having a baby in 3 months. were looking at moving into a new house together because she doesnt like the house im in now. there is nothing wrong with my current house except that i lived there with my ex partner for 3 years. (but who cares right its just a house üôÑ). so my partner refuses to move in to this current place so iv agreed to find a new place with her. she wants me to throw out literally everything i own and start fresh with her. iv agreed to some stuff for example ill get new cuttlery and a washing nachine etc because its nice to have some new stuff but iv refused to sell my modular couch which was a few thousand dollars and my bed which was about $1800. she wanted me to get rid of my 75" tv because 'i may have watched tv and slept with my ex on the couch' but i talked her out of it. which she thinks is a conpromise on her end. she believes its a custom to get new stuff when u start a new relationship and that my old stuff has bad energy üò∂ i looked it up and they said u can use sage to cleanse bad energy even though i dont believe in that stuff lol but it wasnt good enough. her side of the story is that before we met up when were were talking and getting to know eachother my ex's dad died and she showed up at my place and i slept with her and apparently for some reason my stuff reminds her of that. in my defense i wasnt seeing my partner or dating her we had never met only talked. if i made heaps of money and could afford to blow it on a new couch and bed etc then i would but reality is i dont and i dont see anything wrong with keeping it. i said if she doesnt like it she doesnt have to sit on the couch or sleep on the bed. i agreed to upgrade once i can afford it but shes saying she wont move in with me if i bring my stuff. is she being unreasonable? or am i? should i stand my ground? or am i wrong to want to keep it? if im wrong then im wrong but what do u think? my partner is absolutely lovely with an amazing kind heart im in no way trying to put her down but in my opinion i think she needs a bit of a reality check sometimes. or maybe i do üòÖ let me know guys thanks	0

life is truly hopelessi've had a really, really shitty life. i've been raped by cops, sexual predators around the world and i keep fighting for the underdog. we also live in a world where forgiveness isn't possible. so i'm damned if i do and damned if i don't. i really just want to fold my hand and we done. i don't have a racist, homophobic, xenophobic bone in my body...and all people do is criticize me for standing up for people. it's not a pity party for one. the probability of self harm is 0%. i've tried to commit suicide in the past on several occasions. so this isn't brand new territory. as with most things i can't even do that right üòÇü§£ j use dark humor to cope. i don't even think i should post this. but i will.	1
gf [26f] keeps in contact with multiple exes i [32m] have been dating a [26f] for about 4 months. we're both comfortable with each other's histories. however, she maintains contact by text, ig, and occasionally meeting 3+ of her exes. she claims they're just friends and i am giving her the benefit of the doubt. however i am not okay with it. i asked her if she would be okay with me messaging and hanging out with my exes and she said "probably not". i asked her how her previous ltp felt about this all and she said it was a problem with him, too. so, i put it to her like this: the way you choose to operate in life and in a relationship is neither right nor wrong, so if you value "sending ig posts back and forth" and "platonic lunches" more than our relationship, you can continue and i'll move on. there's something about not being able to separate from your past and carrying around a bevy of guys from your past that feels icky and like there's too many opportunities for drama/trouble. am i overreacting or is it weird? also, i asked my female friend (not an ex or hookup or anything) if she was friends with her exes and if it was odd. she said yes she's friends with them, no it isn't that weird. then i asked if she fucked them after they became exes and she said "hell yeah". so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. on top of that, my best friend was dating this girl and she was close with an ex. long story short, a platonic meet up ended in sex and then my friend and her broke up. tl:dr gf of a few months still texts, dms, and ocassionally meets up with 3+ exes and i want to know if i'm being ridiculous in asking her to make a decision between them or me	0

ik this is weird but help me find this book ok so i'm trying to find this book that i read around 2011 when i was like in 2nd or 3rd grade, i never finished it because it was while i was staying at a relative's home and i haven't gone back there. i just suddenly remembered it. it was a yaish novel? the main character was a teenage girl? i think it would maybe be written in the 90s. i only *vaguely* remember one scene, and i hope this isn't some weird fever dream hallucination. maybe the book doesn't exist and i'm just crazy. the scene: the girl and this boy she has had a crush on go to a park. like a central park of a city, idk if it was nyc or not. they get their caricatures done. the boy has a unibrow that she finds charming and the caricature depicts the unibrow as being like "barbed wire". (for some reason i specifically remember it being described as barbed wire.) they laugh and kiss on the grass. i'm pretty sure it is the characters' first kiss. i remember i liked the book and ik it is weird that 7-8 year old me would only remember the kissing part ü§£ but seriously i want to read that book and actually finish it this time. please help. or maybe it's not real and i'm just crazy lol	0

i was gonna troll this sub, but now i'm serious... my time has comemonths ago i trolled some subs such as r/tifu (idk if you have ever read the story of a guy dating a mental hospital runaway.. it got many upvotes and it belonged to me) i actually troll subs especially when i'm depressed rather than when i'm bored. because all the fake stories i write displays my inner world, and people replying to them makes me happy. makes me feel like there'd be someone supporting me if such things happened today i was feeling down again, i decided to troll this sub too, i texted my best friend about it and she said "what an empty person you are!" now instead of a fake story i'm posting my reality. i'm such an empty person as she said. i was going to make some people triggered with my fake story. i don't want to encourage anyone to commit suicide, never wanted it. but i deserve to die as i'm only something a worthless shit my friends tell me my suicidal thoughts are normal as i'm 17 and don't even care about me. none of them tries to give me affection at least. i can't stand living in the same world with such cruel people my family showers me with love but still i feel frustrated, i know that they'll die one day and i'll completely be alone. so i want to die first, because i can never ever live if i don't feel anyone's affection, that's my nature i'm also hopeless about my future, i used to be someone successful with a bunch of dreams, now i'm left alone with my failures and suicidal thoughts. years ago my aunt told me "you'll become nothing, you'll only get married" (getting married is an insult here, as the actual meaning here is achieving nothing but getting married. idk if i could explain clearly). and i think she was somewhat right and somewhat wrong. she was right, i achieved nothing, she was wrong i will never even be able to get married (i'm too young but still i feel my future, which won't even exist) i know that you don't understand any shit from my text, my writing skills suck as i do.... i used to care my grammar mistakes a lot but they don't mean anything to me anymore. everything has ended for me, nothing has a meaning and i'm a mess. i tried to commit suicide 2 times in this year. i prepared everything but didn't continue as i'm too coward to do anything! idk if i'll do now or not. i don't even know what do i do, why do i exist... it was good to know you all if i'm dead, if i'm not dead i'll come back i don't know what i'm saying, i'm probably insane. i'm so sorry, i'm fucked up üò≠üò≠	1

first attempt last nightsorry. after all the stress from work, and moving to a new place and no bed to sleep on yet, and me dumping my girlfriend because i was fed u with myself. i couldn't control my anger. days on end taking massive amounts of mushrooms, lsd, dmtketamine, and whippits tryng to solve life through substance abuse. i was done. i called my girlfriend back to one down because i didn't know what to do. she came running. when she arrived i was tripping so hard on ketamine for 3 days straight with no sleep. after a while it gets very emotional. it was 4am. she was tired so went to sleep. she couldn't fix this feeling i had inside of me that i wanted to end myself. i even told her. so it came time. i ate 20 xanax and layed in the bath and ran the water. i had a little bath pillow so i could fall asleep easier. i get in. so comfy and warm. i fall asleep crossing my fingers.... i wake up in my bed with my girlfriend crying next to me. saying she woke up and couldn't find me and finally found me in the bath with water up to my nose passed the fuck out. if i was left any longer i would have died. she said she woke me up by screaming at me and i gasped water into my lungs. i was ok though. when she told me what happened i began crying and i decided to leave the new house. we hopped in the car and started driving to see my family that i moved away from years ago because i was trying to work and make money in the city. i am here now. i am ok. i regret what i did. i don't think i'll get that depressed again, at least i hope not. life is hard. i love you all. keep truckin. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è	1

the guy [20/m] i'm [18/f] in love with ended up having sec with another girl. so, this might be pretty long but, i've been on and off with this guy for about a year and 6 months. a brief backstory of how we met is through a random group chat on kik, then it moved to a snapchat group chat. we talked briefly and we started a streak with each other for the heck of it. during this time he was living in new york, then one day he sent a streak and at the bottom it said my city name. i messaged him and i was so shocked because he didn't know my city prior to this and i asked him why he's visiting. his response was that he was staying with his cousin and he was wondering why i wanted to know. i told him that i live in that exact city. we were both excited because i thought it was really cool, but he was excited because he's always been interested in me. about two weeks later, i ended up visiting where he was staying and the place was right across from my friends house, a street down from my brother, and about a 10 minute drive away from my house. i thought it was some kind of fate. after that we just couldn't get enough of each other and ended up becoming a couple. through the course of our relationship, it was great for the first month and then things started to take a turn for the worst. when we started dating, i was still a virgin and i decided that i wanted to wait until marriage. i told him this, and he didn't really want this but he still went along because he was very interested in me. even though i decided i wanted to wait until marriage, i ended up giving in to temptation and he took my virginity. i felt awful, but we continued to do it multiple times. around the fourth time, i invited him over to my house and i wasn't expecting anyone to be home until 5:00 pm. we ended up having sex again, without a condom, and i was super scared because i thought i was pregnant. on top of being scared that i was pregnant ( this resulted in me having to take a plan b), my dad came home early & he caught us. i had so much anxiety and stress, i was on the verge of shutting down. my dad didn't even know that i was seeing him, and he wouldn't approve of us being together anyways. my dad was furious and told him to get out, and to never come near me again & my boyfriend packed his stuff and left. after that, i decided to see him after school a week later in secret & we were still secretly dating. we kept this up for about two months, but ultimately we decided to end things. the lack of sex, sneaking around, and barely being able to see him broke us apart. i decided that i didn't want to have sex anymore for various reasons, my beliefs, my anxiety, and etc. we dated from november 2017 to february 2018. we still had feelings for each other, and started talking again in july 2018. we went to the mall and decided to hang out & i had fun. after about a week, we had a long late night phone call and i told him that i'm still waiting until marriage. he sounded disappointed and the call got awkward and we ended up hanging up and that was it. he told me that he never wanted to talk to me again and that we're just done because we can't make our relationship work. in september of 2018, he was talking to another girl, and i would hear them flirt with each other because we were in a ps4 party. his friend would tell me "you see that." and he made me realize what they were doing and i felt like absolute crap. long story short his friend, started making moves on me and i ended up going on a date with him just to move my heart away from the situation. my ex boyfriend found out and it made him so upset, he ended up messaging me, and he called me crying and said that he wants me back. even if we had to go through these trials, he still wanted me back because he said he loves me and he can't see me with anyone else but him. we decided to get back together again. and everything was running pretty smoothly, we went on dates and i would see him more. but, not having sex was really hard. in january 2019, we ended up having a talk again and we "broke up". the reason i put that in quotations is because even though we "broke up", i would see him alll the time. i would go over and cook for him, play games with him, sleep in the same bed with him, and flirt with him,. we still talked about our future together, our wedding, moving in together, having kids with one another, traveling the world together, etc. so, it was basically like we were still in a relationship, we just didn't have the title and we weren't have sex. this month march 2019, while he was sleeping i went through his phone and found out that he was texting another girl that he called his "friend". he once told me that this "friend" might come over his house and they would hang out because they were just friends. i wasn't okay with it, but i said "okay". i went on instagram and saw the messages they were exchanging each other and usually they text on imessage but i didn't even attempt to scroll through all that because what i saw on instagram was enough. he said "i want to f*ck you so bad rn ü§§ü§§" & she said "haven't gotten enough of [insert my name]?". he replied by saying "i don't have sex with that girl, i haven't had sex with anybody since you". at first i thought it was a joke.. i screenshot it, sent it to my phone and deleted the evidence from his phone. i went home and cried, i needed time to think about everything before i confronted him. the next day, i made him breakfast and i headed over to his house. we were laying in his bed and we had a long talk about things about life in general and he was smiling and flirting with me and i was smiling too because i kept telling myself that it wasn't true. after he ate the breakfast i made, he laid down on my lap and said that he's going to sleep. he had no idea about what i found the day before and so, while he was laying down for a minute i told him that i had to ask him a question. he said "okay". i was like "are you ready?", and he looked kind've worried and said "yeah". i showed him the screenshot and his eyes got super wide. i knew that there was a condom in his drawer 4 weeks prior to our conversation and i looked that day while he was in the shower and it was gone. so, i asked him about it and he swallowed really hard and didn't know what to say. so, i asked him calmly if she came over and if they really had sex & he said that they did. i was so heartbroken, i still am. i'm not sure how to react because he said that we're not together, but he admits and says that what he did was wrong. i cried in front of him and he just kept hugging me, saying that he's sorry and that he knows that no matter what he says won't really help because his actions says a lot. he said that he doesn't love her or want a relationship with her and that he wants all of that with me. i asked him why he did it and he says it's because i don't have sex with him. i don't really know what to do or feel. i could use some input.. tl;dr! - my boyfriend of a year and a half had sex with another girl due to me not having sex with him.	0

my [19m] friend [20m] and i just got into an argument. thoughts please... i had this friend i know for about 2 years, i was going through a lot of emotional abuse( not from him, from family ) i was really going through so much shit. (i've since moved out, considering therapy now) i needed to talk to someone, i decided to reach out to him and talk to him about him and here's how the convo went me"hey c, i really need to talk to you,i'm going through so much, and i'm just not happy" him: "ok what's up lol" me: "guess" (he knows it's my family, i've spoken to him about it before, i posted on snap that my family was putting me through hell and he viewed it) him: "um idk lol is sex trafficking affecting you or sumnüòÇ" me: ".... what..." him: "what lol" me: "nevermind" him: "what?" me: "nothing, it's fine lol let's leave it alone, i'm gonna hit you up later about the pills" him: "i don't get it, you asked to talk to me and then you get mad at me for talking to you?" i told him "i'm not at you, i just wanted to talk to you about something serious and it's like you don't care, and i'm not asking you to, but you're making random jokes and desensitizing what i'm going through, and i just want to talk to someone who's actually going to take it serious." then he says "stop trying to guilt trip me for shit i didn't do, youre trying to make me a bad guy" i then say "no one said you were guilty, or that you're a bad person, i just want to talk to someone who's actually wants to hear it, if i made you feel guilty, i apologize, but that's not my intent." then he says "okay i'm the bad guy lol" i didn't even respond. i'm just honestly turned off. but please let me know if this is narcissistic or not, or let me know if i was wrong, i have no problem learning from any mistakes i made tl;dr: i tried to talk to my friend about things i was going through, he didn't take it serious, i said nevermind, and now he says i'm trying to "guilt" him.	0
every birthday leaves me more sad because i feel like less people wish me a happy bday than the year before. i'm 21 today, i'm not saying i'm not grateful for who i do have. but i definitely have seen such a decline in who has wished me a happy birthday. i've honestly cut a lot of toxic people out of my life recently, quality over quantity i guess. what did you do, or plan to do for your 21st? trying super hard not to be such a downer here. ü§ó	0

advice please. ‚ù§Ô∏è hello. my names kayra. i'm 14 years old and in my second year of high school, my friend committed suicide and i have no freaking idea what to do with myself. she passed away little over three months ago, and i'm a mess. i get counselling once a week, i'm on anti depressants and i constantly ask my self what if i had said something to her or told her that we loved her, would she still be here? would she be okay? would she see how many people truly care and adored her. i miss her everyday and the thought of never seeing her ever again brakes my heart and i don't know how to comprehend and understand the fact that she's never coming back. i couldn't go to her funeral either and i regret that everyday. i keep having dreams about her and i keep seeing her lifeless and it causes panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. i wish i could just see her once again, i really don't know what to do or how to deal with this. can someone please just help me.	1

üòí i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong. sometimes i have a hard time believing i can't always be in control of the thoughts, feelings and actions. by actions i mean acting in a state of despair and anxiousness. i feel like everyone is out to get me. i put my walls up and become defensive for no reason. fight, flight or freeze response i think. why can't i live myself without this? i don't mind feeling sad, mad, angry but this is different. i feel insane and it's not normal. the worst thing is i have no control over it and basically wake up hoping today is going to be a good day. i hate that i'm like this and feel like a man child because of it. stress is probably a big part of it but i don't know what to do. i don't get how people can work and not have a breakdown, because i feel like that everyday at work. sorry, this is just a rambling insight of my mind currently.	1

humanity, we are one race made up of many different colours. i've never understood racism, i constantly question why it's an issue. i'm what some would call "mixed race" but this always annoys me. how can i be mixed race, i'm a human being! so i've decided to change my perspective. i started by picturing humanity as a rainbow (everyone likes rainbows) the reason i chose a rainbow though is actually what i picture humanity one day becoming. each colour coming together to make something beautiful, each culture adding it's own unique blend and creativity to form something greater. lets stop hating each other. üôÇ	0

snapping back and forth from realityi am snapping back and forth from reality. it's been six months ever since i got everything i needed to move out, find a job, and study. so far i have managed to achieve none of those things. now i am running out of time. i only have 6 other months left. and it's just.... i spend most of my time doing nothing in my bedroom....i suddenly get a panic attack and realize that i have to do this and that then revert to distract myself with political and historical trivia that is unimportant or video games that i no loanger enjoy i am oscillating between being numb and severe anxiety. i felt serenity when i went out shopping yesterday. it was lovely but temporary....i need to face my issues if i wanna stay calm i miss doing things...just hanging out, doing my hobbies, meeting people, feeling alive...now my mind is just filled with noise and i feel like the life has been sucked out of me. i eat, sleep, shower and argue with people on the internet. i do it on repeat, and just....why can't i do things normally? why is everything so cyclical and why am i hiding in my comfort zone? it's like i am prohibiting myself from living life with all my imagined fears. i have the tools but i keep shaking and wavering. but it's so hard. and i have no one....no one in my life to talk to. just me and the roar of my worn out laptop's fan that has lived far longer than it should have.....just like me sometimes i wish i was normal and just did what i had to do and had people cheering on me. but i am not normal... and i either live with it or die....maybe most people are not normal.... i just want time to stop. life is moving too fast. the months are short and the days are long. please stop. hide me in a dark room..... god please let me do something tomorrow üíú	1
my then fiance (37m), ditched me(28f) at the bar to hang out with my toxic ex best friend litterally all night. i don't know if this is really somthing to still be angry about, and why i still have strong feelings of resentment over it. is it normal for me to still feel this way? tl;dr at the bottom. me(28f) and my husband (37m) have been married for about two years. so, this happened a little over a couple years ago (while we were engaged) and i'm still pretty pissed about it. i don't know why i still harbor resentments over it. i **was** good/best friends with a girl named bri on and off for about 7 years. (i was hanging out with her at a friend's bbq when i first met my husband. after we started dating, he hung out with me and bri a lot.) so, him and i get engaged about two years later, and during that time me and bri were being friends on and off like 2 or 3 times during my husband's and my realationship. she was often a **very** immature toxic person and also manipulative and she would screw me over, be condescending to me, super naggy and would sometimes insult me by making little jabs and backhanded compliments. now, i have a long fuse, and not really one to get mad easily, irritated or start arguments. like at all. i like to just sit back relax and have fun. i also love to dance and laugh and joke around. i would put up with bri until i would just get fed up and temporarily cut her out of my life for a while. then after a couple months, she'd apologize and we'd be best friends again until i got fed up again. my husband (then fiance) knew what was going on and how she sometimes would treat me like dirt and how i felt about her. i would sometimes vent to him how she acted around me, or insulted me or screwed me over etc whenever she pissed me off. he always sided with me. i even had to call him to pick me and my 3 year old up from the water park because she ditched us there with no ride because my 3 year old said that she didn't like bri because bri kept purposely splashing her in the face and making her cry. and bri got mad at me because i wouldn't make my daughter apologize. so he was fully aware what it was like between me and bri. so, a couple weeks go by, and i have cooled down a little, and she invited me to her birthday party at the bar. i occasionally go to the bar maybe once or twice a month. so, i talked to my fiance, and was just discussing if we should go or not, and that i was still kinda pissed at her and didn't think i wanted to be friends with her anymore. i decided that we did need a night out, and said that we will just show up and hang out with her group for a little bit just to say hi, to avoid awkwardness and then we'll just quietly sneak away and go spend the rest of the evening at a different bar. so, at about 9pm, we show up with another mutual friend of hers(katie), who also had the same plan as i made with my fiance because she was kinda fed up with bri too. (bri is super annoying and a lot of people get fed up with her quickly, including basically every guy she dates. this was also the reason why i was friends with her because i felt bad for her not really having friends. she did have her good moments though) so, anyways, bri was wearing this white tank top and a super short denim skirt. katie and i just rolled our eyes at eachother. so, the three of us hang out with bri and her little circle of friends on the bar's back patio for *maybe* an hour? and katie and i are ready to quietly duck out. i give my fiance a look, and say that katie and i are going to go inside and order another drink. my fiance doesn't follow. i didn't think much of it. so katie and i are sitting inside at the bar for almost an hour before my fiance finally leaves bri's little group and comes in to go to the bathroom. by then, i'm kinda pissed. when he comes out of the bathroom, and goes to the bar to get a drink, i give him a "wtf??!" look when he sees me and he asks me what's up. i'm pretty irritated, but i told him that me and katie are going to the bar across the street and that he's welcome to join us if he wants. he said that he just ordered a drink, that he'll join us in a bit. so, i just walk off with katie and we go to the bar across the street. i ordered another beer and hung out there with her for about 2 hours. every 30 mins that he didn't show up to join us, i was growing even more and more pissed off. my pride was the only thing stopping me from calling him and telling him wtf. i also didn't want to be *that girl* who goes over there and drags him away. my pride was already hurt over it, but i didn't want to give bri the satisfaction of seeing me do that. i know her, and i know she was most likely smugly gloating to herself about my fiance hanging out with her all night instead of with me. so, i was standing outside with katie and i'm not only fuming , but also feeling very betrayed when i see bri's little birthday group leave the bar across the street and they started walking to the bar next door to it, with my fiance tagging along with them. i yelled out my fiance's name as he's about to go inside and when he looks over at me, i hold up my arms like wtf. he didn't even attempt to respond, and just went inside the bar with everyone else. even katie was incredulous. it takes a lot to get me mad, but that made me livid. i was like f**k this! let's have another beer, i don't need him blah blah. so, another two hours rolls by and it's bar close. i am not going to be seen by bri and her catty little clique by showing up 4 hours later to pull my fiance away from the group. they all knew he ditched his fiance to hang out with bri all night. what's worse, is that bri was fully aware. he has never ditched me when we would go out together. ever. if i would go to another bar with my friends, he'd always find me and join us. so, i'm like f**k him, i'm going home. so, the way i walk home, i have to cross the street and pass the back patio of the bar. as i'm walking by, i see my fiance sitting with her group right next to her, and then she stood up to thank everyone for hanging out with her for her birthday , and he stood up too and they gave eachother a friendly little hug! (that stung me) i just kept walking and walked all the way home. he showed up 10 minutes later and acted like everything is normal and is all super pleasant and cheesy with me asking if i had a good night. i wanted to sleep before i confronted him about it. the next day, i talked to him about it. i told him that it really hurt me. he had the most stupidest excuses that made no sense. they were so stupid that it angered me even more. so i decided to drop it. this was two years ago, and i have completly cut off all contact with bri, and i haven't talked to her since. it's obvious that i still have resentments over that night, i try not to think of it. but sometimes the memory pops back up and i hate it. oh, in case if you're wondering what his excuses were, here they are: first it was like "i thought we were supposed to be hanging out at her party. i thought you were wanting to be friends with her again " and i reminded him about our discussion before, where i said that we would show up for a drink, then duck out. to which i did when i went inside and waited for him for almost an hour at the bar. then his excuse for when he came out of the bathroom and got another drink inside and i told him me and katie were going across the street was : "you seemed irritated with me, so i didn't think you wanted me around you" to which i responded "so instead you choose to hang out **all night** with the **one** girl that you **know** i don't like because she treats me like shit and is super annoyingand toxic? " him: *again* "you said that you wanted to be friends with her again" (which was the exact **opposite** of what i told him before we left) and i said that i had left the party expecting him to come with too. and he said: "i wasn't really hanging out with *her*, i was talking with her dad all night and there wasn't really anyone else at the bar to talk to." *mind you my husband is a social butterfly. he loves to socialize and can talk about absolutely anything with anybody. it was a saturday night in a small town. there were a ton of people at the bar that he could have talked to, because we know a lot of people, including the bartenders.* so i said "so the whole night, you did not see one person at the bar to talk to other than her dad?" he said yeah. **also** when it was 2am and i saw him on the back patio when i was leaving, her dad wasn't even there any more. my husband was sitting in a chair right *next* to her. so i asked him why he ignored me later on when i called out to him a couple hours later from across the street, when he was tagging along with the group. again, he said he was having a fun time "talking with her dad". i mentioned that when i saw him at the end of the night her dad wasn't even there anymore and that i saw him sitting next to her and gave her a hug. he said that he hugged her because it was the "nice thing to do" üôÑüòí i then took an educated guess to test him by saying that her dad had left **hours** ago by then. he just stared at me blankly. (my guess was right) i then told him that the entire time that we have been in a relationship, that he has never ditched me to hang out with some dude all night that he didn't really know when we would go out together. again, he said that there was not anyone else at the bar for him to talk to which i know is complete bullshit. even after i told him that her dad had left hours ago. he had no justifiable response to *that* of course. he stuck to those excuses and wouldn't budge. it's not like he's actually going to admit the *real* reason he stayed at her party was *probably* because she was looking hot wearing a white tank top and mini denim skirt.üòí tl;dr: my fiance(37m) ditched me(28f) at the bar to hang out with my toxic ex friend litterally all night, and gave me the stupidest excuses as to why.	0

is my [20f] crush [20m] interested in me? if so, why doesn't he speak up? i [20f] really like this guy [20m] who goes to the same university as me. after seeing him around campus for months, i worked up the courage to message him on instagram near the end of april, which is something i rarely do. also, that day, one of his very good friends who he's with a lot at school followed me on instagram too. i thought that was a good sign. fast forward to right now, his twin brother followed me on instagram a few days ago as well as another friend of his, but i feel like the friend could've been a coincidence. he initially caught my eye because over the months i noticed he'd stare at me pretty often in passing. he is also a psychology major just like me, has awesome style, appears shy and reserved, has great music taste and is amazing at art. he had asked me to hangout 2 days in a row after i messaged him, but it just so happened that i couldn't on those days, so he gave me his number to text him if i wanted to meet up because instagram messaging was too difficult. i thought it was nice of him to go out of his way to do that. i had texted him a week later, due to my anxiety, and he was busy that week but said he was still totally down to hangout sometime. that weekend, he came over to me at this festival our school was having and struck up conversation with me. it was the first time we met. later that week, he spotted me in the library and asked to go for coffee that weekend. may 11: i finally went, and it was awesome. he was so polite, he paid for my drink, he was very nice, and the conversation was interesting. we talked about music, our majors, my photography, his art, just random things like that. i thought it was sweet because at one point he mentioned the bar his sister works at, saying it was old fashioned themed, and he goes "oh you would love it". he had mentioned that in high school he was shy and "barely said a word", which i thought was interesting considering i thought he appeared shy. after we walked back to campus, we hugged and he told me he had fun and that we should do it again and for me to text him if i wanted to hangout again. later that same night, he added me on snapchat. now for those of you who have snapchat -- especially people my age -- you know about the snapchat score. his is very low as opposed to an average user's: 29,000 some. mine is 460,000, because i've had it since i was 13 lol. this makes me think he isn't much of a phone person, as i've never seen him on it in person, even when i would just see him around campus. but i could be wrong. fast toward to the last week of school (the week after we hung out), i had asked him to hangout and he responded with "for sure ü§ôüèºü§ôüèºü§ôüèº". we were going to hangout, but then the next day, he caught me as i was getting in the elevator at the library. he said my name and then jogged up to me and told me that he "didn't think he would be able to see me later". he didn't say why, but i had assumed it was because of finals or packing. he then told me that he just wanted to say goodbye, that he hoped i had a good summer, and to "keep in touch, okay?" he hugged me and that was the last time i saw him during the school year (2 days before break). it is now summer, obviously. he snapchats me very frequently, we have had a streak here and there, but my only concerns are as follows: 1. if he's interested in me, which maybe he isn't, why doesn't he continue the snapchat conversation for awhile? he is usually the one to leave me open / end it, fairly abruptly sometimes. we'll have casual, humorous chit chat, but nothing deep. maybe he's rather have those conversations in person? or he just doesn't care? 2. maybe he is shy, and is interested in me, but won't say anything for some reason. does he not want to mess up over the summer and keep things light so we can hangout when he gets back? or has he just not even thought about that? 3. i feel like he knows enough about me to be interested. he knows my interests, my energy, things like that. so what is up with this kid? it drives me nuts, because i want him so badly. i got the ball rolling, so why can't he speak up? tl;dr: my crush regularly contacts me but is strange in the way that he does it. he hasn't outwardly flirted with me, and i can't tell if he's just shy or not into me like that. it's bothering me, and i don't want to have to ask him.	0

dae start deadass hallucinating when they're stressed started happening last year during midterms and finals, this year it's only happening during finals and really only because i'm stressing about how i'm never gonna see most of my friends again next year the hallucinations for me are really mostly just seeing a person out of the corner of your eye or seeing a black figure on the ceiling then looking up and it's gone. last year i remember hearing growls randomly that nobody else could and feeling really uneasy randomly and being paranoid as shit i don't have the auditory hallucinations or feelings anymore thankfully ü§∑	0

things worked out! love story nearly 10 years in the making when i was 14 years old, first month of high school, a class mate of mine shot me a text stating he had a crush on me. this was a surprise, because up until a week ago, this classmate was not fond of me (found out recently that the reason they didn't like me was because they "always want to be the smartest kid in the room", and their ego didn't like that i was a good student too, lol). we "dated" for a month afterwards, and i broke up with him after a month because he was so shy, he wouldn't even hold my hand. we stayed closed friends. he dated others, i dated others. fast forward to junior year: i'm dating a mutual friend of ours who is extremely toxic, manipulative, and abusive. my self esteem and quality of life are at an all time low. i was young and naive and didn't realize my current partner was abusive; that's just how men show love. (super traumatic childhood and upbringing, i had a warped perception of love). my friend confesses he's never lost feelings for me, that he just wanted to grow into a person that would make me happy; no pressure, if i didn't want to be with him, that would be fine. he told me that love wasn't what i was getting from my current boyfriend though, and that i deserved better. some time passes, and i break up with my abusive partner and give them another chance. and he treats me so good, unbelievably good. never raises his voice or hits me. he is kind and gentle and patient. and i become so scared; when does the other shoe drop? i begin to self sabotage our relationship, making up mountains of molehills (it's common for folks who have abusive pasts to always be on guard; if no one in your life has been kind to you before, then what does this guy gain by being kind to me now? what's the motive?) queue abusive ex. threatens to kill himself if i don't do as he wants, uses his own history of abuse to justify his abuse to me. i'm 16, and still so naive, and i fold. i immediately come clean and tell my partner. we break up. i give him space. few months go by. he tells me that he still loves me, and wants to try again. we stay together for the remainder of high school. we decide to go to two different universities far from one another. long distance doesn't work, and we agree to split up again. four years pass; i date different people, he goes on a few dates. we see each other every break we go home. he is just as kind as always, and i assume that he's moved on, which kills me, because i miss him. we graduate with our degrees, and i'm looking towards my masters, completely focused on my career, getting out from under my abusers. he asks me to meet him for coffee, which is very normal, as i said, we make a point of always seeing one another. he is nervous and it all just comes spilling out; he says he's always loved me, from when we were 14 and so stupid. that when he yearns for someone to fall asleep next to, it's always me he wants. that when he is asleep and dreams of his future family, he always sees me as the mother of his children, and when he day dreams of growing old, it's next to me. he couldn't find a partner during college because every woman wasn't the one. i'm ecstatic, but if my life has taught me anything, it's that you can't rely on anyone, and the way others treat you can be fickle. i tell him that although i'm glad, i have my career to focus on. he says all he wants is me, it always has been, and he offers to move to the city i'm studying in, put his career on hold so i can pursue my masters, that he's sorry he's waited so long to tell me. i used to think happy endings didn't happen to people like me. too bruised, too battered, maybe even to broken to deserve happiness. from birth till 18 years, my life was endless tragedy. people "like me" were too rough around the edges, too damaged beyond repair. i've been going to therapy to unlearn my trauma and harmful coping skills. i've surrounded myself with loving, kind, supportive people, who don't use me to an end. i've forged strong bonds with my family. i've put myself through school, i worked 3 jobs for four years, i don't have any debt for my bachelors degree, not a single penny to anyone. i'm about to buy my first car, all with my own savings and no one else's help. i have a job and an internship already lined up to put me through my masters. and that little 14 year old boy, who was so shy he wouldn't hold my hand? he's a fine young man who i'm happy to call my partner, and we are moving into our first apartment together next month. whenever we see children while we are out and about, he points them out and how excited he is to be a father someday, how he can't wait to marry me in the church by his grandmother's house, how we won't ever make my birth mother's mistakes. life has been a struggle for me, to say the least. but for the first time, i can breathe. i'm free from my past, and i have a future that looks like more than pain, poverty, and homelessness. i can't wait to wake up each day! from the time i was five, i can remember my birth mom telling me to use my looks and sex to manipulate those around me to bend to my will, that love wasn't real, and only a good, rich, white man's wife was all i'd amount to. i can't wait for my future with him, i can't wait for my career to take off. i'm so glad i'm still alive, and i can finally breathe. for the first time, i'm more than "fine". i'm great, and i can breathe. have a good day everyone! üíõ	0

a goofy relationship story about soap so this is kind of dumb and cheesy but i don't have many friends i really wanted to tell someone. my partner and i have been together for over a year now and one day we were looking at my snapchat and i was watching one of those oddly satisfying stories and there was soap cutting. i, personally, am not a huge fan of soap cutting, but he saw one where they cut the soap and instead of tipping it over so all the little shavings fell, they scraped them off with the blade they used. he found tingle heaven. so now everyday i watch those stories (i'm now subscribed to three or four) to try to find the rare ones where they scrape the shavings off just to send them to him so he doesn't have to sit through the ones he doesn't like. i know it's cheesy and goofy but i just wanted to tell someone. thanks for reading üòÅ	0

an absolute win so fellow teenagers, a few months ago i made the worst decision of my life. i started vaping. a little backstory, i took my first hit at my job, a guy had a box mod, with pretty low nicotine levels. later, my best friend had his brother buy one for him, and he shared with me. it was great, smoked everyday i had school. a few weeks before summer came around, like may the 9th or something, i got my own. since then i used it daily, until 2 days ago, when i quit. tonight, at 3:00 am, i threw everything away, the pods, the charger, and the vape itself. i feel so clean and happy without it, but nicotine withdrawal symptoms kick in sometimes. tommorow, when the trash gets hauled away, i'll be done for good, with no way of doing it again. i just want to thank this community, as you all provided great memes, before vaping, during it, and now after. let me be a beacon of hope to those who can't stop. if you wanna talk about it, just talk to me, i'll be here for you. thank you, and love you all!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëå	0

things are bad.doesn't feel worth pushing. i haven't told anyone yet, i'm really not ready to tell my family, but i have been diagnosed with a neurological disorder, an auditory processing disorder, a memory disorder, transient aphasia, and something else. tia, tai maybe? something about temporary lack of blood flow in the brain. "altered alertness" was something else they said. i didn't mention to them the voice i've been hearing. i'm not sure i could've handled any more bad news. but "altered alertness" is right. it gets bad. sometimes i find myself in a room in my house with no clue how i got there. i remember being elsewhere. and then i'm somewhere else. but no memory of the transport. (that's not the right word. i can't think of what word i want. travel? transfer?) i'm not supposed to drive. tremors in extremities prompted me to go back to a doctor. sometimes they get so bad i can't hold my phone or a pencil. wasn't prepared for all the news i got. they said it's likely permanent. result of an accident earlier this year. have to have further screenings done due to a bleeding disorder. mixture of coughing up blood and realizing i don't clot on my own after trying my hand at *something*. there's really only one person i want to talk to about it. but i can't. idk. last month i almost jumped out a high rise window. probably shoulda just did it. not really something i want to do. but i feel like it might be my best course. i've lost more this year than i ever thought i could. and alone though it all. i mean, where it counts. i *felt* alone. no one gets it. well, one person gets it. but i don't feel like i can talk to her about it. unsolicited vehicle makes me think i was so much better off a year ago. and i did it all to myself. knew exactly what i was waking into but blind faith kept me walking. i can't have faith anymore. sometimes the universe just tries to tell you something. i miss the life i could have had. so tired of the storms. just so tired. i just don't like myself anymore. i'm not the person i thought i was. there's never a safety net. even if there was one. it promises to be there. but then decides you aren't worth saving. so it leaves. a lot happened today. i think i'll just drink for tonight. i don't think i can do much else. üññüèª	1

how about i do the world a favor and just kill myself? it's either i do it or i don't, but i can't live anymore. i don't care what happens. my family is better off without me. my friends are better off without me. the world will be better off without me. you will be better off without me... i'll just do what the world wants me to do. i'll do the world a favor and just kill myself after school, today. i want to say goodbye...to all of you...one last time... üëãüòî	1

i got caught beating my schmol my dad caught me after i shot the human juice(or maybe not because there was my huge ass pilow blocking the view) and he was like the whole time: üóø. thanks dad for acting as if you didn't saw me, but i wouldnt be able to face you now as your son, therefore i am leaving this house since im an anti social weeb who does nothing but look at anime tiddies all day.	0
very thin line every time i open my eyes to the real world around me all i see is just a whole load of shit, a whole load of fucked up, almost no reason to live......biggest issue is a psychotic step father, no sanctuary at home or outside of home. only thing that helps me calm down and helps me to find meaning in living is music, movies and anime, everything that is abstract from what's happening in reality..... so pathetic and i can't imagine this being a long lasting fix. however it works for now, just putting some songs on in the background makes me so damn calm again. so yeh only reason for living is music and fucking anime üòÇ, you can see how solid the ground is in my life. i think about killing myself sometimes but it just doesn't appeal to me to die in that way. i want to die helping someone, leave the house everyday hoping i'll see some event which allows me to trade my life for someone else's, because that person probably enjoys life more than me..... sorry for the ramble, first time making my feelings public	1
prozac has changed my life i feel like i've finally dug out of a giant hole. instead of dreading being awake most of the time, now i feel... normal (and that's a good thing). i wake up, do what i need to do for the day, and hang out with friends -- and i'm able to just enjoy the moment for once. my ocd has improved drastically, and my mind doesn't loop and twirl nonsensically and invent fears anymore. it's so great to exist in the present without constant anxiety. i am way more social now than i was a year ago. i actually look forward to talking to people now. i feel much better about myself and my life and my future. it's crazy to think that the reason for so many years of dark depression was that my brain didn't have enough of a chemical. i know that many people have bad experiences with antidepressants, but for some reason it has worked quite well for me. or it could be a placebo and i've tricked myself into happiness, either way works for me. brought to you by eli lilly and company¬ÆÔ∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬©Ô∏è$$$	0

üìû hello ... are you there. was the first 4 words my friend said as i was writing my suicide note. i told him before i left school for the day i will not see him tomorrow. i planned to jump off of the bridge next to our school but he decide to ring me. he was in tears, struggling to get out his words and one thing he said to me was "please promise me you wont kill yourself. i know you feel alone and like no-one cares about you but we do." i promised 1 night. and two nights later i'm still here. slowly suffering.	1

tired of trying. i don't hope for much in life only love üò¢ every relationship ends with me getting cheated on or him eventually deciding he doesn't like me anymore outright. i have no motivation or hope to try anymore. i think it's only a matter of time until i succeed in ending my life. those who label my thoughts as selfish are the ones i feel are selfish. keeping me here so they can feel better. i never asked to be born, but here i am being told to just be grateful for all the hardship life has to offer. gifted with the burden of life. i'm not afraid i'm done trying. i've thought a lot about it. my plan is to show up at my ex's work and hang myself on the business property. he never cared or loved me. i loved him. but i was just trash to throw away in his eyes. i tried moving on and got hurt even worse by others. i don't care to be alive. and i can't wait to end it once and for all.	1

therapy is trash was 4 years in therapy and they aaaall gave up on me, because nothing seemed to work. i really tried to tell them everything in detail even tho i'm not good with words. the only thing i refused to do was medication because i didn't want to fake what i feel. i'm rather being depressed than being high on happy pills 24/7, also i've seen what that shit did to my dad. üëºüèª all my therapists didn't know what to do no more and their only way in their eyes left was the mediaction which i refused to take so they just locked me up against my will. it was horrible, i felt trapped, isolated from everything, misunderstood as always and was treated like shit. under all these people who i was told were the same as me i still was getting these looks like i was some sort of psycho. i was ignored and just getting dumb looked at just as always, even though i tried my best. had therapy once a week with a headshrinker who would do nothing but twist the facts. great right!! ü§† luckily i was able to get out because i did some really whack things but it worked, even though they normally wouldn't let me. "because i'm too dangerous for myself and others around me" yeah right whatever. that was the only thing i achieved through actually really trying lmao. sometimes i imagine how it would be if i was still jailed up in there and it fucking scares me was a year ago, don't know why i'm telling this only now but whatever. don't even know what to say exactly but i just wanted to tell something i never told anybody anywhere. maybe i'm getting hate for this but okay go for it it's all a waste of time. :-)	1

accidentally on purpose overdosing with pain killers this isn't that bad but basically my period pains are really bad so i have to take paracetamol & ibuprofen but i completely ignore the pack and take 2 of each every 4-6 hours for 5 days. it's worse when i'm sick like i am now cus i'll have the cold and flu pills as well as the others even tho it says not to. it's not that bad but i know it's damaging my body cus i've been doing this for ages as the only way to manage the pain. i should probably get some prescriptions for the period so i don't have as much shit in me. i'm only putting this in this sub because i sometimes think that i might drop dead in the night cus of all the shit and cus of the scars and all the depressing stuff on my phone they'd automatically think it's suicide when it's just me being stupid and not caring. this is pointless i just needed to vent. most of that probs doesn't make sense cus i'm a bit high üòÇ(just weed dw)	1

a kid peed on my pants and i got the rest of the day off. today was a good day! today at my placement, one of my children peed all over my leg as i was holding her. the educator in the room thought it was the funniest thing ever. the other educator got a pretty laugh too. i was laughing too. it was a hilarious moment, actually. in honesty i wasn't mad at all. it's just a part of the job. i made sure to cheer up the child by giving her a hug. poor girl. i love my placement so much. getting to hang out with a bunch of preschool kids is such a joy. today i felt like a real educator for the first time üôå btw i'm a male. i'm totally proud to say that.	0

after recovering from depression, i'm just grateful to finally be genuinely happy and be able to help people. i wish depressed me could see me now. it would have provided her so much necessary hope üò≠üò≠üò≠ today, i taught my lil' sis who has no idea how to cook to make pizza from scratch. today, i accompanied my socially anxious 18 year old cousin to apply for a part-time job. he said he felt so productive and i felt happy when i heard that. he reminds me of my younger self, but less anxious. his mum told me he couldn't make friends at school and hated what he was studying. so he quit his course after one year and he's retaking our national exam (o levels) in order to get the desired results to get in another course he really wants. i can sense he is a good boy who's just socially anxious. he wants to do things but doesn't know how or where to start. so he just needs a person to guide him and he'll take action immediately. i'm really proud of him. he strikes me as a lonely boy who just wants friends but doesn't know how to befriend them. tbh, i was expecting him to be withdrawn and talk really little but he replied to all of my questions readily and even volunteered information about himself. i was pleasantly surprised by him and i'm just so proud of him for taking a step in the right direction. i know he can make lifelong friends at work and school if he just overcomes his social anxiety and interacts with people. hehe. i'm just so happy i could help! i really am so thankful for his mum for putting her trust in me and giving me a chance to help. i told my friend about this. she said that when i was depressed, i couldn't and didn't want to help people. so subconsciously, my guilt grew and that's why i'm helping everyone as much as i can right now, in order to relieve my guilt. she's right. i'm genuinely happy and i love myself. i never thought such a day would come and now that it has, i'm just overwhelmed with gratitude. i love my life so much right now. thanks so much for reading!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è	0
convince me not to hello reddit! i'm 21 and i want to die. not sure why, but i do. i have virtually no one to talk to. i'm always alone. i try to appear happy when i'm not on the inside. i'm great at faking it. i have spent almost an hour deciding if i should post this or not. finally decided i should go ahead and do it since this is the only place i can. i would get stopped if i told any of my friends. here's what i'm like: the only thing i'm good at is gaming. people think i'm annoying = no real friends. i talk too much. i'm good at isolating myself, gaming all day, sleeping 15+ hours, failing school, swearing, driving fast (100 mph +), keeping my depression a secret, spending vast amounts of money on in game currency, thinking of death. i have taken many notes on what hurts and what does not. ideally i would love to blow my brains out with a shotgun, but guns are expensive and i'm too lazy to get a license. assisted suicide is illegal in my state (plus people would try to stop me). starvation would take forever. lack of sleep: if i didn't sleep for 12+ days people would eventually catch on and stop me. drugs would mess me up if i fail. i would love to go skydiving with no parachute, but you need training and such to go alone. i don't have a garage to poison myself with co. i'm not smart enough to make cyanide or ricin. i'm not interested in the thought of cutting my neck open. drowning or hanging doesn't seem very fun. death by train, cop, or car would potentially hurt others. i would rather not take others with me. last one i looked at was immolation. if that was the only way i would have to find a way to numb the pain. <-- a summary of my suicide & death 'research'. this post would be too long if i did all of it. jumping has a high success rate and i know that there will be a few that miss me, but they will soon forget me. my dad has als and i've decided that i can't stand to watch him suffer. i have the note ready to go and all i have to do now is plan when to go. i'm still trying to convince myself not to be a wimp and quit stalling. like nike would say: just do it! good bye people i've never met. if anyone has a better way to a relatively painless death i'm open to suggestions. sorry if this is against the rules but i just wanted to share my thoughts once with someone before i die. hope everyone here has a better day than me! edit: i'm not so sad anymore today. thank you for talking with me. i'll try harder to not let it happen again üò∞.	1
jerking off saved my life so i've been having a shit year, and for the last few months have been getting more and more depressed. i keep thinking about how i'd be done with all this bullshit if i was dead, and i was planning on just going for it tonight. i was going to say goodbye to someone, and i saw a horny text from a while ago and decided to uhhh go for one last nut. so i did, and then right after i got that yeet of dopamine and post nut clarity was like "bro just be grateful with what you got" and i was like oh shit, i should be grateful with what i have. anyway long story short if you're suicidal, crank one out first üëç	0

he (m28) has a gf (f25) but still looks at me (f24) he religiously views all my instagram stories (even the long ones) whenever i post something. he's stopped liking my pictures because he has a gf now. i know he reads my writing on my instagram stories because he ends up voting in the polls for things he agrees and disagrees on. anyways. we met once almost 2 years ago. every once in a while he'd want to hang out but wouldn't put much effort in and neither would i so we just never ended up meeting up ever again. we just wanted something casual. i knew he thought i was pretty cool but he ghosted me 2 years ago like 2 weeks after our first date since i to him seemed to want something more serious and he wasn't ready. he's definitely the handsome player type. anyways i dropped him cuz that was a dick move but then months later he followed me on instagram wanting to hang out, go to the beach, do thing etc. plans kept falling through cuz i was busy then he was busy etc. but he'd try at least every 2-3 months to see me again (very low effort though from how it was before our first date). anyways he got very close to this girl. literally a day before making her his gf and finding "the love of his life" (he's known and fucked this girl way before he knew me) he booty called me. it was the perfect segway because i broke my old phone and asked people to text me their names to my phone number. he quickly did that in hopes of a booty call. this is what the booty call looked like: hey cutie. its _______ btw. (inserted pic of himself) oh hey! how have you been? hope you're keeping warm. good just bbqing. i'm a bit cold do you have a cure for that? hmmmm warm yummy tea or activities that make you sweat üòúü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i could deff use some instructions if you're down ;) sorry i only fuck people i know well and vibe with, and i don't know you well. i'm sure you'll be able to find someone! have so much fun ‚ò∫Ô∏è i did thank you üòâ have fun cutie aaaayyy perfect ü§ôyou too babe. (lol what salty kind of person says "i did thanks" haha who says that to someone?!) **tl;dr**: since then he's constantly watching my stories. especially because he knows i have 3somes with this beautiful woman and there's a guy now that could have been him. my life is very casual right now because i don't want something serious. **why not delete me if you have a gf?** i'm not a person a gf would want their bf to be viewing their stories and posts.	0

feeling weirdly grateful for problems in my life. the max income threshold to qualify for a local medical access program was lowered recently. so i can't work the hours i needed to pay for discounted access to my psychiatrist and prescriptions. i would qualify again if i dropped my college classes this semester. if i stop taking my meds it will affect my grades and mental health (obvs) and i could have a manic episode around finals and waste the entire semester, worsening my financial health anyway. it was suggested i take out subsidized loans to pay for my mental health treatment. so i've got that to look into. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but i'm oddly happy. these problems suck but they're a vast improvement over my past problems. they show considerable progress in my life.	0

my boyfriend (26m) can only sleep with the tv on (via ipad) and i (21f) can't sleep with the tv on - is that a silly reason to breakup? we've argued about this so many times, and just had another one. im lying awake in bed üò° he struggles to sleep without the tv on. he uses his ipad. i struggle to sleep with it on. ive asked him to lower the brightness, lower the sound, use headphones. he usually will lower the brightness and sound unless hes bejng petty and silly. he is adamant about not using headphones though, and will not consider sleeping with the tv off. we've discussed it to the point of him saying if you can't sleep with the tv on then maybe we should break up. hes also said i should sleep at mine instead and not sleep here (like, ever), and i was like, do you think we could have a relationship like that? and he said no. he says meditation doesnt work (i love it though). he has to sleep to tv shows or movies (marvel, etc). not documentaries, not white noise etc. i am so annoyed right now. there's no compromise and it's very aaaaaargh!!! tl;dr: silly issue, but no compromise. usually compromise is elsewhere in the relationship. but not here. is it silly to breakup?	0

am i in bois? so this girl who i've been friends with for like 8 years and secretly had a crush on, has been changing lately. she started to talk more often, told me personal stuff, added me to her private story, and let me follow her finsta. she has also been a little more smiley, always send selfies, and she had me over on the fourth of july. at her party, we went in her hot tub. she wanted to sit close next to me and we just talked for a while. later that might, we went to see fireworks and she sat very close next to me and rested her head on my shoulder. after that, we went to my house for more fireworks and she held me hand. she was taking lots of selfies with her face up against mine and sending it to all her friends. two days ago, her friend started texting me asking how i felt about her and i was honest. she was like "omg" and "yay" but idk how she knew. she went on vacation yesterday and has been snapping me nonstop. and just 20 minutes ago, i was sent a bunch of selfies and at the end, she said "goodnight‚ù§Ô∏è", which she never sends me that. when i responded with the same thing back, she sent me a hand-drawn heart. i'm planning on taking her to an amazing park soon when she returns. am i in? can someone help?	0

why growing up depressed is the worst thing ever. tl;dr is at the bottom i am a male 14 year old boy btw. i was born into a family without a father and my mother being a cop. so that meant until i was about 9-10 my mom was constantly sleeping and working because she worked the night shift. i spent those years developing no social skills and becoming a nervous wreck. to make it more clear, i built a stronger relationship with my dog than my mother. then comes the day my mom decides to go back to college and quit her police job to spend more time with me. this seems like a great idea to 9 year old but that was not the case. my mom quit her job and was always very open about the financial position we were in. this worry that overcame me when my 8-9 year old brain realized that money ruled the world caused me to view life in a more real way. i like to pin the point where i realized money was the center of the world when my childhood ended.(sorry for getting off topic). but if you guys know how much money college kids make then you know it's hard to turn out real money and so this caused me to worry and be anxious. around this time my mom moved me from the amazing state of louisiana(sarcasm) to virginia to share a house with some old friends of hers. virginia was painfully average but that was good. to a 10 year old me having a nice home to go to and not to hear my mom worry about money made me happy. then my mom got curious one day when her friends were out and one had left their phone. the phone had messages from one of the old friends to the other that said "how's the bitch(my mom) doing?" and other stuff. so for obvious reasons we moved back to louisiana but to a nicer neighborhood. the nice neighborhood was nice when it came to crime rates and etc but the people were actual demons. i mentioned before that i was anxious and felt worry about a lot of things so being bullied and manipulated didn't help. i had a friend named harry(not his real name). harry pretended to be my friend but he really just wanted to keep me from being friends with garret(chill guy and obviously not his real name). so it ended up being a thing where he would try to manipulate me by making me feel bad about myself and break promises. i think i've been getting ages wrong in this story so far but he would cheat and grief in minecraft worlds where i worked hard in. harry would also push me to the edge and make me lash out emotionally to the point where he would tell his parents that i was being mean to him! this eventually went on until the 5th grade where i broke off him and garret moved away awhile after this so we won't see a return of harry(hopefully. he still does go to my school) 5th grade brought a whole new challenge to my life that eventually made me have little to no self confidence. i was accepted into gifted (a different set of courses that you can get into if you have an iq above average). i entered gifted at the end of the year so i didn't know what was going on in any subjects. this led to me feeling like i was stupid although being in gifted and left me feeling like people were judging me for how many questions i asked. so now by the time i enter 6th grade i'm unprepared, depressed, and anxious. i haven't mentioned my mom so far but she plays a big part of why my eyes see my life as a dumpster fire. in 6th grade my grades never broke ds and cs. this caused my mother to create a mindset in me where all the bad grades were my fault. that i was always the problem. that i had the potential to be the best. to my 6th grad brain this was a lot of pressure and since my relationship with my mother worsened i unconsciously disobeyed her commands which caused her to blame me for more and more causing my self confidence to plummet and for me to constantly think that if i look sad than i'm looking for attention and that if i want someone to realize that i'm sad and to talk to me than i'm an attention seeking nerd. i finally passed 6th grade but 7th grade was going to be the hardest challenge. 7th grade is what confirmed my mindsets of feeling like i was never good enough and that i could never be above what i was now. my mom continued to put me down which lowered my self esteem and self confidence to the point of true depression. around this time i joined a robotics team that introduced me to my current friends which sounds good to an average teen but it's quite the opposite. these friends were nice but my mindset made me think that they constantly judged me and i always felt like i needed their approval so i tried to be the kid with dark humor to gain attention but it ended up with me diving further into depression. at the end of 7th grade one of my friends told the school counselor that i looked and acted depressed. after a few sessions i felt much better and talked to my mom about the problems which didn't go so well. she yelled at me for explaining that she was the reason for a good bit of my depressive state. she screamed "dont you blame me for this". after this point i developed a strong hatred for my mother. we have fights close to everyday still. eventually this ended and i went to 8th grade and my robotics friends went to 9th grade since they're a bit older.(i also had girl troubles that reversed the sessions with the counselors but i'll speak about girls at the end) 8th grade was the most average year in the past decade. but i was still anxious, awkward, and depressed and i still fought with my mother. girls. zoinks bro. the first hard crush i had on a girl(we'll call her girl#1) developed after the sessions i had with the counselor. i told some of my closest friends which included girl#1's best friend. so when i confessed to girl#1 she responded with the rudest statement which was "i know. maybe you shouldn't tell your crush's best friend". she then made this face :/ and walked off. the worst part is that i later found out that she was gay and none of her friends hinted to me that she wasnt interested. i understand that being gay in some cases is a secret but someone could've tipped me off. so this instantly makes me feel that i couldn't fully trust anyone(this feeling had passed now). after this i went awhile telling myself that i wasn't good enough for girls, i wasn't good looking, i was weird, i was too awkward, and i was too annoying. recently i met another girl that's really cool, she's bi, likes music, is in the same friend group, and likes the same movies as me. of course i feel as if she doesn't feel the same way as i do because she constantly walks away from me and has proven that she is more interested in my best friend than me. (she's given signs to my best friend that i haven't experienced). but girls are cool and all but tbh i'll take a break from the whole dating scene if she doesn't feel the same for me. thanks for hearing me out guys. i'll check back after breakfast. üëç tl;dr: my life is filled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts because my life has been filled with constant worry, manipulation, bullying, and a bad relationship with my mother.	0

it's been 5 years since i've had a "first date". i now i have three days to plan one. my ex and i became a couple when i was 19, broke up about 6mo ago - a few weeks before my 24th birthday and my move to a new city. she's a great girl and we're on good terms, but it's still been tough and lonely as hell. fast forward to the last few weeks - i'm finally adjusting to single life and have been spending a lot of time with a new group of friends, including one girl in particular. our group just wrapped up a birthday weekend for one of us, and she fb messaged me asking if i wanted to hang out sometime. i'm pretty sure we're on for wednesday. i didn't even have a proper first date with my ex - we met at a party, kissed, then had a date, then became a couple (until 6mo ago). she was also my only relationship, the girl i lost my virginity to, and the only girl i've ever slept with. i honestly don't even remember what dating is like. i haven't had to go on a one-on-one date with a woman in so long and i'm anxious af. i'm terrified i'm going to make this awkward/screw this up somehow - which i really want to avoid because this girl is awesome (and cute!). anyone want to calm my neuroticism and/or brainstorm ideas with me üò∞? edit: sorry for the title. apparently i had a minor stroke while writing it... edit 2: [update](<url>) for anyone interested! thank you everyone who replied to this post :)	0

should i [21/f] tell my parents that my bf (now ex) [25] sexually violated me? it happened over a year ago when i was still a virgin. i snuck out of the house to see my boyfriend but before he came over i made it clear that i didn't want to take my shirt off and i didn't know if i wanted to do anything sexually yet. i told him i strictly wanted him to come over so i could be in his presence and hang out and he said he understood. he picked me up and we parked near a dark and quiet place. we started to kiss and then he started to get kind of aggressive, he pulled me by the hips to where he was then on top of me while he smashed his mouth onto mine. at this point i was still so inexperienced and i thought this was just how makeout sessions were supposed to go so i stuck with it. it wasn't until he put all of his body weight onto me and started tugging at my shirt to take it off that i started to freak out. his face was still smashing mine so my verbal "no" "stop" were muffled. i will never forget how in that moment i just laid there and was terrified i was going to be raped. i said no and stop a couple more times until i finally had to kick him off of me. i looked at him and said "i think we should stop" he gave me the ugliest glare and said "oh so now you want to stop?". i felt so defeated and small, i had no clue what to do. he was making to seem like i baited him to come out there for a good time, i specifically told him that i didn't want to take my shirt off and to not expect anything but he ignored that. i started to feel like it was all my fault so i offered him head. üòê thinking back on that i'm so embarrassed, i knew how uncomfortable, hurt, and scared i was in that moment but i naively offered to try to make him feel better. he declined and drove me back home. i just sat in my room and sobbed. he sent me text after text telling me how he feels like he sexually assaulted me and how he wasn't raised like that. he said his parents would be so disappointed in him and he's afraid i'm going to tell the cops . the whole time i was consoling him and telling him that i didn't feel like i was raped or sexually assaulted so he didn't have to worry about it but to never let it happen again. the next day he couldn't even go to work he was so shaken up and i couldn't even eat. he profusely apologized and said he was in the wrong so i forgave him. six months later we were completely fine and happy but we stumbled on the place where that night happened. we sat there and he said that it wouldn't have happened if i didn't bait him there. i kind of laughed because i thought he was kidding but he sat there and said he was dead serious. he went on about how it was my fault and if i didn't want anything to happen then i shouldn't have come out. i couldn't help but cry the rest of the way home. i obviously don't want to do anything legally about it. i just want to be able to release something that has been giving me anxiety lately. is it even worth saying something to my parents or should i keep it to myself forever? tl;dr: should i even tell my parents that my bf(now ex) almost sexually assaulted me? i'm not sure how to even classify something like that. i didn't feel and don't feel assaulted but i did and do feel violated. it's been weighing heavy on me lately and my parents are people i always run to when something is bothering me. some backstory: fast forward, we aren't together anymore. his brother died, he wouldn't see me for a whole year because he said he was depressed. i tried to take a break from our relationship about three times when i felt completely hopeless and depressed but he would hit me with the "wow, my brother just died and you're really going to leave me?" so i felt stuck and stayed. i would ask him every week for 8 months if he wanted to hang out but a few hours before we would be scheduled to meet he would cancel on me. he canceled two hours before our anniversary, didn't tell me happy birthday, and would constantly tell me how the turmoil in our relationship was because i was not supportive and was self centered. on the year mark of us not seeing each other because of the depression he felt after his brothers death, i found out all this time he was curving me he was seeing his ex.... he even helped her with her new apartment by setting it up and buying her things. we haven't been officially together for a month now. this was my first relationship and it was a very manipulative one. it wasn't until my parents pulled me out of the relationship that i finally left.	0

bringing up the friend zone. advice/input welcome!!! first let me say, yes girls can get friend zoned too!!!! i work at a restaurant with a guy who's around the same age ad me. we're both 20. i didn't see him as something that could be more as a friend until a few months ago. it started in august. we started hanging out together, about once a week. we'd go to the movies or dinner. he would always pay, because he's that kind of gentleman. i just saw us as being friends, until my family got involved. my mom and two aunts work with us and they made this big thing of us hanging out so much, and i would constantly have to tell them we aren't dating, we're just fri3nds. my birthday came around and my mom threw me a serprise party and he was the only one i wanted there.. and of course my family invited him, so i picked him up when he got off of work. i went back to college so i come and go from the area, it may have been the time away and coming back or my relatives asking, but when we'd hang out i starter to think what if this was a date, it wouldn't be so bad. anyway, i didn't think i was friendzoned, i thought he may have tho if hr about it too... he would send me snaps calling me "mi amor" and sending me snaps with the kiss faces and üòçüòôüòòüòö. i guess i mistook that and opened up my mouth a few days ago. i woke up to a text today that said "whyd u bring up that friend zoning thing last night? i just want u to know that i've never seen you in any other way than a friend i'm sorry but i'd rather be honest than lead you on." i just hope i didn't fuck up our friendship now. tl; dr: i read the signs wrong, got feelings, now i might've gotten feelings. :/	0
need to die i really wanna die. and i wanna die now. but there's a specific way i wanna do it and unfortunately i don't have access do it because i'm 16 and no one around me has access to it either. i thought about doing it a different way that i might have access to , but it seems like that way won't work and i just want it to work the first time. but i can't make it much longer so idk what i'll do tbh. there's been a few moments of happiness but it's so fleeting that it's like it might as well not have even happened. i wouldn't even call it happiness, i would just call it feeling okay for about five minutes. i could go on and on.... idk what this is honestly. i already know what i need to do but it's like i want to do this one specific thingü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è idk, idek what i'm doing or what i'm hoping to gain from posting this.	1
i never understood the meaning of life until.... this is my first post ever so please be constructive and positive üòä i'm a new mom! i'm turning 30 and never thought i would have the chance to make my own family. when i was 18 i was diagnosed with pcos (polycystic ovarian syndrome). my doctor wasn't the most informative or willing to try to treat me. he told me i had a severe case (no period in over 2 years, many cysts) and that i most likely never conceive and if i did i would most likely miscarry. i told people i didn't want to get married or have kids because i was embarrassed. i felt like a failure and didn't want to commit to my bf (we've been best friends beforehand for many years) because i knew he deserved a family and i thought i couldn't give him that. i would cry and contemplate why i was even here when i couldn't even do what women were put on this planet to do. (please no comments from sjws, thanks in advance) fast forward 6 years, i'm now 24yo. i've moved 2500 miles away from the only family and friends i knew to gain new perspective. my bf ended up quitting his job and moving away from the only family he knew to start over with me. he said kids and marriage wouldn't make him happy but that being with me would. he's such a great person. he would encourage me to go to the doctor, get a second opinion, discuss plans and treatments and supported me in my weight loss journey (lost 150 pounds!). we got married in 2015, bought a house in 2017 and adopted 2 sweet doggos along the way. it's now 2019 and 7 weeks ago we welcomed our son dean. i have never felt so complete. i cannot imagine not being a mother or being married to my best friend. i cannot believe that at some point a doctor made me believe this was not possible. i see the value in all life, i'm empathetic to others and have patience. my heart is broken for others who have lost. i'm filled with joy for others finding their happiness. i was truly granted the most blessed life when i felt the most undeserving. anyone out there feeling the way i did, please know that you do deserve love, a family and you are worth everything! thanks for listening even though the best part was getting to write it down...	0

my uber driver was a kindred spirit hello everyone! this is my first post on here and i'm on mobile so apologies for the formatting or any misspellings! so i just got home from seeing detective pikachu (great movie btw!) and i have really bad anxieties about taking the bus at night. where i live is pretty safe but where i wad downtown there can be some pretty shady people there (i usually don't run into trouble but you don't wanna be caught in a bad position!) but anyways, i was kinda panicky cause my phone was almost dead and i just had enough battery to pull up the uber app and get a ride. i ended up getting a really nice guy (not the scary internet 'nice guy' either lol). he was one of those who're like 'hey how was your day, you need anything? want a bottle of water?' i was still a bit shaken up by having gotten on a wrong bus (thankfully the driver pointed me in the right direction it just would've taken me like an hour more to get home) and he put me right at ease ü•∞ he even said to me "hey op, your a good person' and he seemed to genuinely mean it. so jamie if your reading this (which i highly doubt) thank you so much üòä	0

the cat and mouse game üò≠ (24 f) i met this interesting man on tinder (25 m). we became friends. initially he told me he's not interested in dating or getting into a relationship. i should've been out after that, just because i am looking for an actual relationship. i like to be straightforward from the very beginning just so that i can avoid playing games like this and getting into messy situations. (what i'm dealing with now) however, i was sort of desperate at the time that i met him (a year ago). having no friends, going through a rough time, i decided "okay let's be friends" ü§ó i couldn't resist my attraction for him at all though. he's literally the embodiment of what i consider to be the perfect guy. his looks, personality, the way we communicate, etc. i felt a deep connection to him. i only get to see him once every couple of months, however we usually texted like 24/7 getting into really deep intimate conversations with each other. so, the more i get to know him...the more i feel like i need to stop talking to him. why? well, next up i find out that he's special ed, has never been in a relationship before, is jewish (he put a huge emphasis on this part) and we come from really different religious backgrounds. his family life sounds hectic af, but honestly i can relate to that part since my story to his is very similar. look, i'm an open minded person okay. i seriously don't freaking mind that he's all of those things. i consider myself just a normal kinda girl really. i've been in plenty of relationships before (long term ones usually) and i'm very understanding and accommodating. every time i see him in person, i can't help but to fall deeper and deeper, into something that feels very hard to come out of. however, he is the one that is continuously holding back. i have a strong feeling that he feels the way i do. i know there is a real connection between us, or maybe i'm just delusional, i don't know anymore. the game has been non stop. it's becoming too much. i don't know how he feels about me truly. he considers me as a dear friend okay. it hurts. literally every other guy i know has no problem committing themselves to me. he's playing soooo hard to get, or maybe he's genuinely not interested in that way. he wants to know every sexy detail about me though. i just don't get it. subtly flirting with me, but never going anywhere really. i feel like he's just leading me on, playing with my feelings and emotions at this point. it's a new years. i've wasted a year talking to someone that'll never lead to anything more. huge waste of my time. i need to get back into the dating world (since i put this aside after meeting him okay) and maybe start again. however, the only problem now is that it's hard letting go of this all. i don't fucking know what to do. he can't seem to let go of me either. but, i can't keep playing this game. he drains all of my energy. if i were to find another guy, that would mean my energy goes to him. this is why it's hard for me to let go. even worse, i've fallen deeply in love with this man. i feel like i genuinely understand him. it's unfortunate though, we're just friends, but sometimes it doesn't feel that way. i don't know what to believe. part of me wants to confess already and move on with my effing life. the other part is stuck and doesn't want to make a move otherwise everything gets destroyed. wtf do i do?! tl;dr	0
leaving a butt plug in for too long i'm sure this has probably been posted more than once, but it's far too embarrassing to tell a single person i know, so let me tell thousands of people i don't know instead. like any good couple, my boyfriend and i like to get a little kinky from time to time. nothing too major, but i wouldn't always call our sex life 'vanilla', you know? so, when we got home after walking the dog and he told me to "put my butt plug in," i obliged without a second thought. we've been using it for a couple of weeks now and i haven't had a single problem with it. i put the plug in and we carried on with our night. i had honestly completely forgotten that it was in there until (i guess) a couple of hours later when it started to feel sore. figuring that it was just aching from being in there for so long, i went to go take it out. to my horror (of course) the flared end of the plug had wedged itself inside of me. i could feel the very end of it, so i pushed my fingers inside and tried to hook them around the end of the plug in order to pull it out. this is where i really fucked up. not only are my nails much too long right now, but in my attempt to remove the plug, i somehow managed to push it even deeper inside of me. my fingertips couldn't feel the base anymore and i knew that if i tried to pull it out, i would either make it worse by pushing it in deeper still, or i would end up scratching myself with my nails. which left my with two options. the first option was to rush to the emergency room. it wasn't even so much the embarrassment of having to have the plug extracted from my asshole by a doctor or nurse that scared me as much as it was the questions my parents would ask we asked to use their car to go to the hospital. so that was out of the question. the second option was to run downstairs and ask my boyfriend to remove it. it would save me the embarrassment of having a third party present, but i knew he had would have no idea what to do. he's not a doctor, and there's a chance that he could push it in deeper, too, make it worse somehow. i decided i would take my chances and ran downstairs, into the basement. i tugged him into the bedroom and immediately removed my pants. before he could ask any questions, i choked out, "it's stuck." his face went from confusion to realization in a matter of seconds. he (far too quickly) sprung into action and with something of a miracle on my side and a shit ton of lube, he was able to remove it after a little bit. he later told me that it was horizontally inside of me, prodding at what i assume to be my bowels. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è tl;dr: my boyfriend and i decided to use a butt plug, i left it in for too long. it got lost inside of me and he had to take it out.	0

almost hooking up with my girl best friend. so. i'm 17 and she is 16. sit down guys. you're in for a ride. so this week we've been having testing days at my school. monday was half a day, meaning i wouldn't go to school until 12pm. well anyways, on monday, she(lets name her april) and my friend (ted) and i went out for lunch before class at burger king. we talked and stuff. so we decided not to show up because we heard that teachers weren't taking attendance. we three chilled at my place and by 5pm i had to drop her off at work. so i did. tuesday comes by and i see her. i somewhat felt a connection and i know she did too, but we didn't do much tuesday besides me dropping her off at her house then taking her to work and picking her up. silly me. suddenly i'm a taxi. well, wednesday comes by and another half day. ted couldn't hang out so i asked april if she was down to go for breakfast at 9am. so we did, but my brother was with us this time. we ate and headed back home. dropped my brother off at school and now its just me and her. we were watching south park, and i had to go to the restroom. i come back and she's on my bed. (me and my brother share the room and there's 2 vertical beds). she was laying on mine. i let her know i was gonna lay down next to her to get some sleep and she just faced away from me and dozed off with me. its 12pm by this time. i wake up to turn the tv off and to get a blanket since it was cold. i cover her and me up. i go back to sleep, but i spoon with her. i liked it. its been 2 years since ive had cuddled with someone with no intent on any sexual intercourse. so i doze off again. about an hour went by and i wake up to her turning around and wrapping my legs with hers. she picks up her dress she had on and starts grinding and i mean this is my best friend i'm talking about here. i've never even had the thought of doing this with her. we kiss and she gets on top of me. i loved it!!! but i dont want to screw up and be an asshole who just wants sex. i kissed her. told her to stop. think about it. i asked her "are you sure you want to do this?" she let out a loud breath. i'm bad at taking hints. so i kissed her. and went down on her. about to lower her panties and she pulls me up and kisses me and tells me something, i don't fucking remember what she said. i was on my game right there. but she stopped me just like i stopped her. i had my button up shirt half unbottened. my zipper open and she took off her cardigan. we were set, but our conscience wouldn't allow us to go any farther. i honestly loved her since the first day i saw her in my class, but some asshole friend beat me to her. he hurt her. broke her. made her go through shit she really didn't have to go through. i was too slow. now i'm here. writing to people who will probably not give a shit about what i'm going through here. she has a long distance relationship with a kid that falls asleep on the phone, leaves her unseen, and can't take care of her for shit. i'm over here driving her around town. pouring my heart out for her. but theres still more to this guys!!! after we settled down our hormones, we talked about what would happen. will we be the same? i told her "lets just wait on that.' she stayed quiet. i think she honestly wanted me inside her so bad. i did too! but i love her too much i don't want to use her or hurt her in any way. but i should've because now i'm hurt. we shared stories we've never shared with anyone else. we talked and cried together for 2 hours straight. i connected with her ever since. but today (thursday) in school lunch period, it was like it didn't happen. i told her i love her. i kissed her. i dont know what to do. i text her good morning and good night. gave her a call before work in case she needed a ride after. guys. i need some help. i feel like shit because i've never opened myself up like this before. its like i'm hugging a wall and the wall wont hug back. thanks for reading. have a nice day. tl;dr- i had a perfect time to date my bestfriend but i pussy out and give you unnecessary details. edit- thanks for the advice guys/gals!!! now i'm clear minded on what to do. i don't want to loose her as a friend or as a potential girlfriend. so ill just ride this one and see where it leads. edit- i asked her out for some breakfast tomorrow morning but she is exhausted from work and has family over. asked if saturday and sunday was good. she said if we can before or after she works we can üòç	0
dept. of labor contradiction i was debating a friend of mine about the wage gap¬ÆÔ∏è¬©Ô∏è and went off to do my research. i found a [white paper study from the department of labor] (<url>) written in 2009 that ends with the conclusion > as a result, it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men differently on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women. in addition, at a practical level, the complex combination of factors that collectively determine the wages paid to different individuals makes the formulation of policy that will reliably redress any overt discrimination that does exist a task that is, at least, daunting and, more likely, unachievable. however, in 2012, the dept. of labor posted [a blog post](<url>) effectively recanting the conclusions of the aforementioned paper. what is one supposed to conclude from all of this? is there a more reliable source for information on the wage gap? thanks!	0
rant about shit life yeyüôÇso.. i really want to end my life, everyday i wake up,eat and play videogames. my grades are shit and if my mother find out about them i'm going to get in serious trouble. i can handle the hitting and her taking away my phone but i can't stand being screamed at. i'm so terrified of exams, i literally text other girls in my class to send me the answers to the homework and i barely understand anything. my sister is silently judging me because i keep asking her to give me homework answers. i barely talk to my friends about anything outside of school, most of the days we ignore each other and they have other friends and i always ruin my relationships with other people because of what i define as morals so i know it's my fault things are like that but i just feel so lonely and each time i try talking to someone online i just sound retarded af. i stopped doing the only hobby that i enjoy because i don't get noticed by other people and it's almost like it's forgotten and i eat so much shit that i look like harry from harry and the fucking hendersons and i'm not willing to do anything about it because there's no point. if i get i fail or get anything less than 90% then i'm going to do it. the only actual reason that's keeping me from doing it is because i don't want to end up in hell, but i'm not a good person and i have the morals of a prostitute so either way i'm going to spend eternity with satan. this post was useless and apparently i can't talk about how i feel without sounding like a person with a single digit iq. i pray to god and sincerely hope that the next time i'm falling asleep is my last time.	1

anyone thought of purposefully getting infected by the virus?my life has steadily gone down hill the past few years after experiencing extreme physical and mental trauma from abusive relationships. i've always been opposed to life, not necessarily suicidal just tried to find little things about the future to keep me going. i moved to a new state six months ago with my fiance. almost immediately we lost our jobs and our already unhealthy relationship took a turn for the worst and he abandoned me to go back home to maine. i fought like hell to pick myself back up and for the first time in my life i was truly happy with who i was and being alone. fast forward a few months later i got swept up in a relationship with the most loving caring person i've ever met. i self destructed that relationship tonight because i don't know how to communicate and push people away. i have been both mentally and physically abused in my past relationships before this man and i don't know how to be in a healthy relationship anymore if i ever did. every moment with him was pure bliss and now that i've experienced a relationship like that i'm ready to go. i lost my job because of the virus, i'm alone in a state with no family or friends. my current living situation is hell and honestly what has pushed me over the edge. my roommate is verbally and mentally abusive daily. i can't even get back to my family on the opposite coast if i wanted to and i'd be terrified of infecting them. i've dreamed for years and years now what i would do it if things ever got this bad. now i feel like i have a socially acceptable easy way out. i could be just like rest of the victims dying and my family would think it happened naturally. i just have no reason to live anymore and i don't want to. i've fought for so long and so hard and now all i'm left with is debt, ptsd, no hope for the future of my industry that's collapsing. i just don't want to exist anymore. i'm a high risk patient so i don't think it would be terribly hard to catch if i want to a couple hospitals/dr offices/places where people are blatantly ignoring social distancing. i'm currently sick with strep, have severe asthma, and scar tissue in my lungs from almost getting wiped out as a kid. as i watch the death tolls rise. i'm sleeping outside tonight so as to avoid my roommate and it's already pretty chilly. i only have a thin blanket and foolishly left the house in shorts. i don't believe in god, but fuck i'll pray to him if he lets me go to sleep and never let my eyes open. i'm so terribly ashamed of how i treated a sweet amazing man who didn't deserve it. my plan is to try and get myself infected and and sleep in a tent out in the wilderness for 2 weeks. if i haven't caught it yet i'll try again. just to make sure i'm not asymptomatic and infecting innocent people. damn it feels good to have a plan that will let my family grieve and know this will all be over soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è i know this option isn't for everyone, but i am so terribly ready.	1
always the same words native english and always was a stronger class in school. anytime i have to write the word 'separately' out for work i can't remember how to spell it, it's driving me insane. i say it like a pirate to try and help me remember, kind of like singing b-ana-na-s or repeating the elevator scene for beautifulllll. but this dang word just isn't clicking. who else has to teach themselves spelling every single time they use a word? üò©	0

i'm 15 and ruined my life my only option is to die and i can't do that so in january 2015 i found out i could force days off school then the day after that faked tearing my thigh muscle and managed to get a month off school, then when that month ended i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which made me have even more time off making it even harder to get back afterwards although for the rest of that year at school (7) i managed to keep an ok attendance and everything was working out then in july 2015 i started to drop off with managing my diabetes which then caused me to lose motivation then in september 2015 i had another month off school, that was the first time i felt suicidal although that didn't last long and everything (except my diabetes which got way way worse) started to improve until after christmas, in january i had another month off school which caused me to officially drop out in february which is when everything started to fall apart, i started pushing away my at the time girlfriend became essentially a hermit let my diabetes get worse and basically did everything in my power to make myself worse 2 months later i lost 3 of my 4 best friends (the one i didn't lose being my ex) then just preceded to feel sorry for myself for the next 3 months when i became friends with someone i used to hate who's now my co best friend (co with my ex) after that nothing changed until january 2017 when i decided to try and get back to school that didn't work out at all and i just got worse afterwards after that nothing changed until june when i started being even more of a wanker to my at the time girlfriend by stopping talking to her and carried on doing that until october when i started talking to her again in december we got back together and i got a job although me and her only lasted throughout december, in january i badly injured my foot which got infected gave me sepsis and nearly killed me (typical of my luck that it didn't üôÑ) and i quit my job not long afterwards in march i got back with my ex and i stopped pushing her away but still wasn't anything close to a proper boyfriend but between march and may was the best period of time i've had for years and in may someone kissed her and that was the "final nail in the coffin" between us in that way although we're still best friends but it got to the point where the last thing keeping me going was me and her and now it's gone i've lost all hope because nothings fixable anymore but i'm too fucking pathetic to even kill myself i went out to jump in front of a car which sounds stupid but still and i didn't even have the balls to do it and i don't know what to do because i can't go back and fix things no matter how much i wish i could and i can't and i can't end it but at the same time i can't carry on because i'm basically dead anyway all i do is listen to music and watch movies	1

an invitation. hi. i'm not really sure if i should be doing this but here goes. i'm here to say that if anyone reading this would like to vent about something and get a random stranger on the internet opinions on it, i am here. i am not a therapist, but i am a good listener. i'm not trying to get your money and i'm not trying to trick you. the inspiration for me posting this comes from today. i have been suicidal for years but continue to stick around for my family, and tonight was the first time i ever reached out for help. i contacted 3 online crisis lines, which quite frankly made me feel even worse. one operator could barley even hold a discussion, another essentially hung up on me, and the other told me the service cost $200 a month. i feel like people like us who read these subreddits are not going find use in those services, so perhaps a real discussion with a human could help. in a strange way i find listening to others problems and trying to offer insight helpful to my own health, so if you are interested then let me know. ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

getting to know people for podcast hey guys! so i'm interested in starting a podcast later this year (probably late august, early september) and i want it to be like a group thing! like the mcelroy brothers, for example (not the same content, just the group dynamic/idea). this isn't an audition at all, but i think it would be great to find a group that all fits well together and wants to do something like this in their free time i don't want to seem exclusionary in this at all! like i said, not an audition at all because this will be way unprofessional as far as podcasts go, but i didn't know if anyone else was interested in ever finding a group of 3 - 5 people to host a podcast with and wanted to work with me to find said group i'm sure that this post is starting to sound snobbier as i go on, and that isn't my intention in the slightest, so i'm going to stop now while i'm ahead. this has just been a goal of mine for a while and i figured you guys are all nice and cool and would be fun to talk to! (and location doesn't matter at all! everyone could skype or something and record it and i can teach myself how to put together a decent sounding audio! this would be for fun and experience and friendship, so it's most likely something you would want to do if you're very interested in something like this üòÑ)	0
i just want it all to be overi just wish i could die and all the pain would finally end. as long as i can remember i've always been treated like less than a person, in elementary school i hated waking up in the morning because i knew sooner or later someone and their friends would decide to harass me. as an example i remember once i was playing at recess and a group of four kids started throwing rocks and acorns at me, even dirt which would get into my mouth because they would throw it into my face. then i tried to run away and they followed me wherever i went, so i tried hiding up on a slide "jungle gym" of sorts and they just continued harassing me and even wouldn't let me down. but as soon as i tried to defend myself they ran to a teacher, and would you like to know what i heard from her? "why should i believe your story over these 4 boys?" so basically on a weekly basis my parents would be getting calls for the school about how i "started a fight with other students" then i would be sent to the principles office to be physically assaluted for trying to defend myself (if i beat someone with a stick for trying to stop a rape i would go to prison, but apparently it's ok for adults to beat kids who are only trying to defend themselves from being stalked outside during recess and have dirt thrown in their mouth as a sick joke) that went on from kindergarten until 5th grade, after that it was usually harassment about my weight, my red hair and glasses, or how because i and a friend always hung out together we must be gay. when i would go home from all of this every day i would be told i was a liar if i tried to tell the truth, and i'm firmly convinced my dad just didn't give a crap about what was going on, because all he would ever do is scream at me and hit me. he didn't once listen when i would ask for help. you know, and the funny thing is i thought after i finally got out of school i might be able to be myself and the harassment would end. nope, i've been out of hs for 3 years now, i've had about 13 jobs because no matter where i go there is a member of management who enjoys making every moment there a living hell for everyone, so after a few months of putting up with them constantly complaining about everything i finally snap and quit. my first job i had for 2 years, and it was a daily thing to be asked "why don't you care about your job" when you are only trying to do your best, the manager would never offer any help, or try to tell you an easier way to do something, nothing but negativity, sometimes he would make up things that he "told you to do already" and then tell you you were a bad employee for not doing them! if ive been here for a year and never been told to do this why am i suddenly going to start doing it unless you tell me!!!!!!! i had another manager cuss at me because i had to change my schedule (starting 2 weeks from the day i notified him) etc. aside from that it's like everywhere i go people want to insult and belittle me at every turn, i just want to go to work to make money, this isnt supposed to be a high school!!!!!!! the only job i ever had that i like was at ut arlington library. because i was actually able to go to work and do my job without interference from people who just want to bitch about literally anything they can think of constantly, and it was so quiet there. im sick and tired of this, i just wish i could kill myself. i just want to be treated like a person instead of a piece of garbage.... i just go home every day from the harassment alone and i lay in my bed all night wishing someone was there to hold my hand. the only relationship i've ever had was 2 years filled with emotional abuse in high school. i was made to feel like i wasn't good enough and she used to torment me by refusing to even acknowledge me sometimes, then i would do everything to get back on her good side so that she would treat me with love again the next day, but then it would repeat and repeat and repeat. for the entire two years. i finally cut it off once she started referring to me as her brother to fuck with me emotionally. we couldn't even have a conversation without her going off the deep end about something and then trying to make me feel like shit about it. she would even cry if i didn't want to talk about a certain topic about myself that made me uncomfortable because she believed everything was her buissness. but i miss having someone hold my hand so badly, i miss being touched and kissed, i miss it so much, no matter what i do nobody ever wants me. i just want someone to care, i just want a hug üò¢ my last job was as a dominos pizza delivery driver, and i loved it, the first one i've liked since the library job, and i made 6000 in 3 months of working there so the money was great (i usually made 700 every month if i was lucky at most of my jobs, minimum wage jobs rarely guarantee full time hours, and getting a second job is impossible when the first one expects you to be available at any time and never gives you a set schedule) but then a customer followed me 5 miles back to the store and started verbally harassing me at the store because i (and btw i wasn't riding the tail of his car) apparently was riding his ass while driving. what actually happened was the guy was sitting at a green light like a dumbness and then when he finally moved he was going a full 25mph in a 45mph zone. rather than get stuck behind another red light i followed closely because he's hardly moving, and so after we leave the intersection i'm of course going to go around so it's not a dangerous situation. well, before we even get out of the intersection he slams on his breaks, almost making me hit him (it wasnt that hard to avoid actually, there was about 5 feet between our cars and we were going maybe 25 ) and before he does anything else i just drive to the right and go around. while i'm looking in my mirror and going the speed limit i see the recede behind me but then after a few seconds the guy start to gain on me (so obviously speeding) i didn't really think anything of it until i made a turn off the road and he followed me. so i made a few more. and low and behold, i'm being followed. so i got back to the store and the guy started harassing me in front of management, i stopped the interaction and told the manager i wasn't going to deal with this since my shift had actually been scheduled to end a half hour ago, and if they didn't cash me out i was quitting right there. so there goes another job. im just about read to call in the cards on this life.	1

recently started dating my best friend of 12 years. anyone else in the same boat? tl;dr: so... the title pretty much says it all. who else has done this? i've (33,f) recently started dating my best friend (32,m) of 12 years, we've always had a very obvious attraction to each other but until recently never really acknowledged it past flirting when we get drunk (only ever when we have both been single). a bit if background. we have always got on really well, have an incredibly open relationship and can talk about anything, there is never any sort of judgement or embarrassment. we have had periods of time where we have 'lost contact' i put it like that as it has always stemmed from one of us having a partner that dislikes/feels threatened by our friendship and have decided to 'ban' us from talking to each other. side note: it never actually worked because first and foremost we have an incredibly strong friendship and though it would be far less often we would still always find ways to check in with each other. there have also always been lots of 'convenient' excuses; we're both already with people (or at least one of us is), we don't want to ruin our friendship and mostly we were just scared to actually face up to it. so we have recently (the last month or so) actually faced it and decided to give it a go. it's a really strange thing going from just friends to being openly affectionate with each other, but at the same time seems like the most natural thing ever. mutual friends (and his mum) have all seemed to breathe a collective sigh of relief that we've finally got together. no pressure or anything! üòÇ has anyone else been in this boat? what were the best and more importantly worst bits of it for you?	0
living with poor self esteem and unfulfilled been depressed most my life. suicidal thoughts a lot in and out. i don't want to go through with it nor do i have a plan. made a few attempts (wasn't a full attempt, more like well if it works then it works if it don't it don't). like i said i don't want to and i can't explain what i was feeling. i kept all attempts to myself and only people know one incident. i felt awful, so i was hoping to gain what i felt tortured for not having. left my town, left my job. now i have less support and lost the things which bring me comfort and stabilize me and hardly get work. i can return home i guess but will probably feel defeated. i have low self esteem and confidence because just feel bad. not even a huge reason like others do like loss. sorry to all of you. it's more existential and asking what's the point? i think i will always live poorly never being good enough. i can't accept it because it's lonely and shameful. i have friends and family but it doesn't mean that i am valuable. it just means death will hurt them. here's how i think of it. i am like a dog. people like the dog decent enough, but in the end the dog is still a dog. can't eat at the table, can't jump on the couch, can't sleep in the bed. i usually say, "everybody üëèlove üëètheüëè dog üëèbuüëèt nobodyüëè gonnaüëè sucküëè theüëè dogsüëè dick" again not at code red for threat. i feel i am stressed for not having any sexual value, have been single for 10 years, have moved down the socioeconomic ladder, lost my comforts, have been beaten by negative experiences. blah blah blah. first world problems, but suicide is a first world issue. i am on a 4/7 or whatever the suicidal scale is and i'm still in the green-to-yellow zone financially, am only 30, and nobody knows how depressed i am but i know can get so so so worse. fuck i have no idea what i'm even asking anymore	1

saying goodbye, one last time... i want to say, i'm sorry that i'm the real problem. i'll kill myself and it will be the only way i'll forgive myself and escape the pain. i just don't want to live anymore. i'm not important to anyone. my life is replaceable, anyway... my family is better off without me. my friends are better off without me. the world will be better off without me. you will be better off without me... i will do what the world wants me to do. i'll kill myself tomorrow after school, or the next day after tomorrow...hopefully everyone will be more happy with me gone... the time has come for me to die... so, i just want to say goodbye... goodbye, everyone... üëãüòî	1
at the end, but stuck. i have been having intrusive thoughts for about 20 months. i want to kill myself. the only thing putting me off was the fact i'm breastfeeding my daughter and she couldn't survive without me. now she is nearly 2. she still feeds but she can survive without me, so can my 6 year old. i want to end it. i bring nothing to my family. i don't work right now. i went from school to college to uni, then had my youngest. i've only worked at one place whilst i was in college. i'm nervous to work again even though i have a degree now. my partner brings in money. i contribute nothing financially. i feel so low i can not motivate myself to have the house sparkling clean every day. i am fat. i am ugly. i am worthless. i am a failure, of a partner and a mother. my issue?? whenever i think of commiting suixide i can't decide how... step in front of a vehicle or off a bridge onto the motorway could ruin someone else's life.... tablets will just leave me in pain for days then i'll get better... i have no access to firearms... sleeping tablets aren't strong enough... and the other issue? if i think of something all i think of is my kids growing up without me... like i want to die but i don't want to emotionally or mentally scar them... would it be better to run away then do it so they just think i ran away, not died? sorry for the essay üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠	1

üëãi made this throwaway for totally different purposes but before i log out now, i figure i should use it to get some more personal thoughts out. i just fucking hate the fact that someone can turn your entire life upside down overnight, make you question your own existence and suffer zero consequences for it. talking about my scumbag of a dad, who built his life on the lie that he's straight when he self-admittedly knew he wasn't. and now i'm supposed to just play along with his plan for a happy little step-family, after he's gotten everything he ever wanted = kids from his fake marriage + a new boyfriend, by using people for his own personal gain. but i'm the one that's meant to accept and forgive, deal with the emotional fallout of his lies and the divorce, while he walks away blameless having knowingly and purposefully deceived everyone close to him for decades. because his life is *just so hard*. of course, like no one else's who never turned out a total douchebag. the worst part isn't my dad's betrayal, though. it's having literally no one around me for support. my entire family is acting like we have to walk on eggshells around dad and they seem to be suffering from collective amnesia about his decades long fraud, even mom. ironically the only person who has shown me sympathy is lgbt herself. anyhow. i just had to vent because a lot has been on my mind these past few weeks, and today has been especially shitty. i've been crying uncontrollably for the past hour. i just feel like everything's falling apart. and in the end, everyone thinks i'm just another ungrateful teenage brat and my dad's brave for being authentic. i don't really have a conclusion. i'm going to try and fall asleep now that my chest feels a bit lighter. kinda been wanting to post for awhile actually but i'm too tame to use my main handle for this, so hi i guess?	1
screen recording my snapchat stories so i don't screen record or use snapchat a lot. i started playing around with screen record on my phone to see what it can do. can it record the screen of the camera app? yep, sure can! hmm, can it record snapchats? hmm i don't have any snaps, i'll just look at the stories. so i start watching some stories from people, and i haven't watched any in a while so there's a decent amount. anyway then i close the app and end the recording. sure enough, in the video there's all the snaps. i close the phone and forget about it. until...this chick snapchats me all asking me why did i screenshot all of her snaps... i tried to explain how i didn't mean to, my bad etc. i did toss a lol in there though cause..i found the situation a lil funny.. ...and i may have fucked up more by recording my screen of me going to my camera roll and deleting the video.. she goes "why are you doing it again!?" and in the meantime she's saving all of the chats we're exchanging. so i feel like i fucked up recording in the first place, and fucked up how i handled her texting me too, god damn. fairly sure im likely im going to be subject of another snap story of hers as a total creep job. smh y'all, ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, tifu. tl;dr: i screenshot someone's entire snapchat story and appeared creepy af.	0

(she was the first i dated btw) so, i'm in the military and i stopped seeing my parents about a year ago and we barely get to talk bc i'm so busy and i was facetiming my mom and all through it i couldn't stop thinking about ^^^ that^.. but yeah.. i miss having that connection with someone. tbh i bought there's anyone out there that's as a weird a fuck as i am lmfao üò≠	0

i got blindsided today context (my first post and i'm on mobile) so yesterday i made a deal withy grandpa that we would go to a bookstore and select the book and that day i woke up at 12 pm but decided to wait till like 3pm so i did that so we went to the car the beginning so when we drove to the bookstore (it was in another city like 20 km) l was just sitting in the back seat bored, so i waited and so to pass time me and my grandpa were talking (along with my brothers) and there were lots of accidents on the way (mind you this is saudi arabia in ramadan in the afternoon) we eventually reached there and we took quite a while. so then we were choosing our book (btw i chose harry potter and the philosophers stone,im already on page 71 üòä) and i chose it early while my brothers took quite a while so i decided to go to the gaming section (this bookstore has more than books, it sells electronics and accessories) cuz i'm a 12 y/o and finally we are done (we came at 4 we left 5:30) and we pay. the accident- so we were going normally, and part of this route is to turn in to a apartment neighborhood? idk but there was this little truck (it was like a pick-up truck but with a longer back thing and the storage thing(,can't find photos) and it was parking on the left side of the street and changed its mind to go right and rammed into us and at this moment we are just casual and then we here a bang noise, like a really loud one and the car kind of gets lifted on the side (my lil bro thought we were about to flip) i was freaking shocked and scared so i was like getting my mind together on what happened then i realized what just happened and then my granddad went out to check the damage and the guy from the truck came out looking like he was in the verge of tears and they and my grandpa went out to deal with it, and someone who was behind the accident stopped and helped and after 5 min someone else came and by 20 min there was a croud of 7 people and i asked to see the damage, and boy was it bad, i had a photo but it disappeared üò≠üò≠ and the door had a huge dent mark and the little thing under the door was detached the car that we were in was a toyota rav4 (2018) the conclusion the car rn is getting fixed and yep	0

is he (m27) cheating? i'm a girl that isn't looking for anything serious at the moment. i got out of an 8 year relationship almost 2 years ago and still enjoy being single for the time being. i met a man off tinder over year ago. we agreed to be fuck buddies but never slept together on the first date because i didn't want to drop my pants without knowing the guy a bit. we had a great first date filled with lots of kissing. after that time we never met again (this was december 2017). he ghosted me, i flaked on him a lot and that was the cycle for all of 2018. he'd compliment me a lot and try making plans but i was busy. when i wasn't busy he was busy. but i didn't care much for him other than finding him very attractive and fun. every month he'd message me and reply to my instagram stories to remind me he's still alive üòÇ i'd do that to him every once in a while too haha. i just found this whole silly game funny and never took anything seriously. now the issue, he wanted to meet up with me in december (2018) but the plan was never implemented. i posted a modest nude of myself on new year's eve which he responded to saying " damn i want to see more of you in the new year. happy new year cutie keep up the üî• in 2019 üòç" i said "haha we keep flaking on one another though üòÇ" and he said "just waiting for the right time i guess üòÇ" hours later he posted videos of him and this girl at a formal new year's eve party! i know this girl has been a hook up for him for over a year but he never started posting her till november of last year. clearly this man is a player. i know this but i also don't care. anyways he's been posting many things with this girl in january since they have been clearly spending most days of the week together and he doesn't mind showing her off which is cute. he booty-called me about 3 weeks ago which i was surprised about because i thought this girl was a gf or just someone he was planning on getting serious with. i rejected the booty call by saying "i only sleep with people i know well and vibe with and i don't know you well :( i'm sure you'll be able to find someone tonight! have so much fun" and he said "i did thank you üòâ have fun cutie". a couple weeks later he posted cute valentine's videos with her. it seemed like the got super serious about 2 weeks ago and be booty called me 3 weeks ago? they spend so much time together and she's constantly in his posts. he views all my stories i post religiously still. but never likes any of my new pics anymore like he use to. **tl;dr**: if he's not satisfied with the girl why is he dating her? i think he's just a shit person but maybe he's still single? i know he cares for her as a friend. but he barely knows me and booty called me so idk if he's cheating or just has a fwb he likes to show the world he's dating now. but never showed her face before	0

i am tired. so this is just a vent post i don't need any advice or anything at all but if you read this ily when i was like just learning how to walk i broke my left leg once and also broke my right leg 3 months later which got fixed and i had to get a fracture. i don't even remember this but this proves that i have weak bones since the beginning. now i'm a regular happy and healthy child. it was normal day at school and my pe teacher told all of the kids to race (i was 5 in 1st grade). i was at 2 nd place during the race and another girl who wanted to take my place made me fall by sticking her leg infront of mine. i didn't fall very hard but i hit the ground at such an angle that i broke my femur (longest bone located at thigh). i was sent to the hospital in an ambulance service provided by my school and had to get a rod placed inside my leg and i was on bed rest for 6 months. this forced me to get study material from my friends and i went to give the important exams like mid term and finals with a walker. then it was the time to get the plate removed and i was on bed rest for 6 months again. i was in the early stages of recovery and limped while walking. just three months after the surgery my father was going to buy something from the departmental store and i begged to go with him as i hadn't gone anywhere except my school in the last year. but unfortunately a drunk idiot in a car hit us. after this accident i was on the road crying as i wasn't able to get up. my father somehow managed to get me to hospital. this is where we found out that i had broken the same bone again just a little lower than the last one. i had to go through the same cycle of getting the plate added and removed (1 year). things started to get better but i was permanently scared of falling from now on and my family was emotionally scarred because of the things we had to go through. when i was 11, we shifted to another city to get better medical treatment for me because i limped all the time. we went to a chiropractor, he was helping me do some knee ups and i randomly fainted. i woke up 2 minutes later and we visited the doctor and i found out that i had torn my ligament i had to be on bed rest for 3 months. after three months i started to walk a little bit. after that i was at my aunt's for dinner or something and the floor was wet and i slipped and fell on my knees which again tore my knee ligament. the same fucking bullshit again. finally, it had been three years (age 15) and nothing had happened to me. obviously i gained weight due to so much bed rest and being unable to move. i got diagnosed with pcod. i immediately started going to the gym and followed a strict diet. and guess what i fell again because some kid in my building had left his toys on the stairs. i broke my femur yet again. this time my family decided to go with im nail surgery. this happened last year and i still have the nail in my leg. i keep thinking about this and i just keeps me up a night. i missed my whole childhood. i missed school. i had to give exams from home. i still scored straight a's and my teachers motivated me. i think that i am a burden for my family. i really want to kill myself sometimes. i always injured my left leg so it is extremely weak i limp all the time so people give me weird looks.and if you're still reading this thank you form the bottom of my heart. thank you‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫	0

my (21f) relationship with my boyfriend (22m) is starting to feel, to me, like it's stagnating. i don't know if it's just my depression coloring things or if i need to seriously look at changing our relationship status sorry in advance for the long post. i'll try and make this as objective and coherent as i can. my boyfriend and i have been together for 7 months, and we've been friends for even longer. we've been happy for most of that, and when the relationship started i was over the moon. it was all sneaking away for a quick kiss, weekends together, "i love you" texts multiple times a day, calling each other every night, etc, etc, so on and so forth. at first we kind of had to keep our relationship on the down-low, because we met at work (but we never worked together-we worked completely different shifts at an ambulance company, so it's not like we were seeing each other 8 hours a day five days a week where we couldn't act like a couple). there were some bumps but there are in every relationship. plus this is my first relationship, and his first serious relationship, so my mantra through all this has been "we're figuring it out together", and it has rung true for quite a while. but the honeymoon phase is pretty much over now, and i don't know what i think anymore. i know i love him, but i don't know if our long term goals are going to be compatible. i don't even know if he knows what his long term goals are. our schedules have both changed, i've moved jobs and he's changed shifts, and at most we get less than 24 hours together every week. the calls have died down and the texts and snapchats are a lot less fluffy and gooey, not that i particularly mind that. i'm definitely not great with being open and emotional. i think maybe the spark is gone, but it's very hard to tell. (i know for sure the physical spark isn't gone though üòÇ). there are lots of complicated factors here. the first and biggest one is that i have moderate to severe depression, and i've been in a pretty bad slump lately. i'm working with my doctor to adjust meds and get in touch with a therapist but for right now i'm really struggling to feel happy, or much of anything really. i'm lonely a lot but it's not either of our faults. and i knew from the get-go that my mental health might make things difficult. another thing is that we live an hour away from each other by car. that doesn't sound like much, i know, but i think it's hard to be half-long distance, half not. getting our own apartment together is not a feasible goal right now as i'm headed back to college to prep for nursing school and we both agree it's a step too far for now. i live with my aunt and he lives with his parents, so either way, we rarely have time to ourselves outside of locking ourselves in a bedroom together, and it really honestly puts a damper on our sex life. it doesn't affect me much. my sex drive hasn't ever really been crazy and the antidepressants don't help; i can and do get in the mood but i don't really care that much if we don't have sex, and i don't feel the need to give myself pleasure, so to speak, when he's not there. we've gotten a hotel room in the past to get away for a while and have an upcoming hotel stay booked but that doesn't happen often. my boyfriend has honestly been amazing despite all this. he's patient and loving and has never pressured me into doing something i don't want to do. he takes no for an answer if and when i change my mind about anything. he has never made me feel anything but safe and secure with him around. his mother definitely raised him right, and i'm lucky he chose me. we rarely fight and when we do it's often very quickly resolved. i can't stay mad at him for long, i just love him too much. so honestly, i don't know what i want to do here. i don't want to break up with him, but i don't want either of us to feel like we're settling. i don't know how to bring this change up. i know the strongest relationships are the steady, patient ones and not necessarily the young-love, firework type love, if that makes sense. but there's a difference between steady & strong and just falling out of love. i understand that love is a choice and i'm trying to choose it but i don't know if it's working. and i might be the only one who feels this way. for all i know, to him everything is peachy and still amazing. how do i revive my relationship? how do i make the changes that need to be made in order for us to not just exist, but thrive together? how do i even bring this up? i'm just so lost and confused and i know i tend to be pessimistic at times. sometimes i can see us lasting for years and sometimes i don't know if we'll even make it to a year. any advice or guidance helps. thank you guys so much in advance. üôèüèª tl;dr: i love my boyfriend but there are a lot of obstacles in our relationship i don't know if we'll be able to overcome, but i know i'm not thinking with a clear head right now due to a depression flare up, and i don't know how to communicate that or change it	0

located woolite and received a free hug ü§ó today at my retail job an older lady came in (maybe late 50's early 60's agewise) very sweet lady. i asked her if i could help her find anything and she wondered if we carried woolite. i told her i believed we did and led the way to the aisle it should be in. i did not find it and proceeded to explain that a work at four different retail locations and get confused on which store carries what. she was only slightly disappointed but thanked me and went on to shop some more. about 10 minutes later i went back down that aisle and my eye just landed on it right there in front of me! i grabbed a bottle and found her a few aisles down and she looked absolutely overjoyed and dropped her hand basket to give me a hug. i normally love hugs but i got caught way off guard and tensed up but i was happy i found it for herüòÖ can we have more humans in this world like that sweet lady?	0

the fact that your brain wants you to die, but your body will do anything to survive is bullshitno matter how hard you try, it's all pointless because for some reason your brain is dead set on feeling like the worst shit possible by default. if you start to feel better for even just a little while, it will all come crashing back down again so you feel worse than you did before. why do some people have mental illness and others don't? why are others fine and do i have to be put on meds, not even to be fine, but to not feel anything? what fucking genius created life and decided some people just aren't allowed to have the freedom of a mind that's not constantly telling them that it'd be better if they're just dead? in a world where the majority of people are inconsiderate, judgemental know-it-alls who want to decide for you that what you're feeling isn't a reason to kill yourself. üëç	1

waiting for this day to happen. üíÄüíÄ üî´üî´ imagine. it 9pm outside. i am walking home. i stop at a convenience store to get a drink. i stare at the drinks and pretend like i am having a hard time choosing one even though i know what i am getting. two guys with a ski mask on come into the store and start shouting. one says "get the fuck down bitch" to me. i am inside thinking "this is my lucky day!" i get up try to fuck with them. they shoot me. that simple. no other shit like "omg he killed himself" or "wow he was suicidal." simple. he got killed at the convenience store. done. i dont have friends, girlfriend or any one close. just my family(3). they will have much better time coping with my death. my enemies and competitors will throw their hats to the sky and have a lit party and dance hype all day. my aunts and uncles throw a party and celebrate the day they have been waiting for. maybe i should just take my brother with me. he is gonna go thru the same shit as me. i know it. he will need a help and a guidance. it will be hard for him without me. if we(my bro and i) leave then my parents will be better financially since they always says they do all this hard work for us and stuff. if we are just gone then it will be easier for them. they dont have to try hard to raise us. they will just mind their own business and simple. i mean why the fuck did they have sex and made us if they were going to say this everyday??? "i gave birth to you so i can kill you or do what ever i want to you." or "i am suffering financially to put a roof over your head". just stop it then. like you don't have to. i mean what the fuck is this life? am i born to make money? wtf? i go to school for 12 years just so that i can make money in the future? life is meaningless. its stupid. what the fuck is food. if we did not eat food then we would be fine not working our ass off for $$$. we can literally go ahead and do our favorite shit without worrying about anything. i mean what is the point of living with stress and pressure to chase money in the next 50 years when you can just get rid of all that today or very soon. if i were to live next 50 years, i still will be having stress and problems everyday. it an unfair world. stupid. pointless. money can buy anything. no one gives a fuck about how hard you work. money can buy that shit. ps: i dont own a gun but i really want one so i can gtfo here. oh btw i am a pile of poo and i cant do shit.	1

a pale blue dot üåé this might not resonate with everyone who reads it. but i've recently been involved with astronomy and astrophysics for about a year and there is something which i've realised on the philosophical side of it. 1. we are abandoned in a meaningless universe to find meaning for ourselves. 2. we are just specks of stardust on a big rock 3. there are innumerable numbers of stars, planets, blackholes, galaxies, anomalies out there and still we are so bothered by the frivolous things in life. 4. the mere thought of finding extraterrestrial organisms in space will unify humans. 5. it's both horrifying and satisfying to think that nothing matters in the grand scheme of cosmos. a pale blue dot.	0

i didn't think i would ever be saying this on this community, but i'm going to kill myself.(this whole thing was typed for over 2 hours, it later turned into a rant, and i'm actually in a safe place rn)i joined suicidewatch to help others, and i have been doing so much better compared to previous years with my mental health. i didn't think i'd ever tell you guys i'm going to have my final attempt. i have 5 ways to kill myself- all available right here, right now. the landbridge less than a mile from my house- i can climb the fence easily and jump. i have nail polish remover and all the other products in my bathroom. i have all of my iron pills and this one medication for my stomach. i have my blades and all other sharp objects in my house. i tried to hang myself with my so-called noose and it didn't work, but if i put more time into it i could make it so i wouldn't be here. i'm not going to get into what happened, because it's a lot, and not hearing it from me in person will make you think i'm one of the worst humans ever. i basically told my "best friend" something about my other best friends suicide attempt, she later told her what i said and from the reaction i know she didn't say at all what i told her. a gist of it is that i told(we'll call her r) r is that i was jealous over the support that (i'll call her g) g had from her suicide attempt. before i said the word jealous, i remember specifically telling r that i didn't mean what i was going to say, but that i couldn't think of a different word. i told g over text that i didn't mean jealous at the time, and that i would never be jealous over her attempt- but that i was sad over the support she got. it's 23 days until it's the day that a year ago i had my almost fatal overdose(that hurt my brain to write). i didn't tell my mom until two days after that i took a large amount of tylenol. my friends knew, including r and g. r at the time didn't have her license so she couldn't drive over, and i told them not to tell my mom so they didn't. i mention the license because i told r that no one checked on me, and right after i said that i said i know you couldn't drive but you asked your mom to drive over to g's house. i didn't have anyone waiting for me in the emergency room and no one visited me when i was in the general hospital. anyways i'm going to stop there with that part of the story and wrap it up with: i'm not killing myself, so if anyone even read this(and i know no one did) don't worry!!üòò	1

kicking my girlfriends mum in the face first i would like to state this was not today (my bad) but i thought it was too good not to share with you. secondly she is not my girlfriend anymore (supprisingly) anyways i used to always sleep at my ex girlfriends parents house. we where 17/18 at the time at her mum and dad where quite strict/batshit crazy. so we used to go out at the weekend and get wasted from alcohol and other things (best left off here) and she would sneak me into her house so we could... you know... do stuff üòí as me and her parents didn't get on i would usually leave early before they woke up. this went on for about 6 months and being a total master desguise i managed to get caught a total of 2 maybe 3 times. the last time i got caught of course happened to be the incident in which i am describing to u today. she caught me ravaging her daughter and went totally unreasonably mental! so after kicking off at her daughter (not much was said to me) she stormed downstairs. me having an impeccable judgment decide it was best to leave. but not downstairs (where she was lerking) but out of her sisters bedroom windows. i know what you are thinking... what a brilliant idea... who wouldn't think of that?!?! üòï so i kiss my then girlfriend goodbye and make it heroically out of the windows and down onto the... i'm going to call it a balcony but it's more just like a concrete slab that rested above the front door. i was far too hungover for just jumping down from the, i'm guessing around 9 foot drop. so i decided to grip the edge of the slab with my hands and lower myself down slowly and use my kind of swing myself down onto the grassy area of her front garden. making it an easy landing. so i lower myself down and start to swing my legs backward and forwards so i could jump behind me onto the grass and avoid the steps beneath the door. but as i swung (no wore that 3 times) as i was about to to make my gallant jump. her mother opened the door and step onto the first step. bang!! yup i kicked her in the face with both feet. i basically drop kicked this withered old hag and knocked her strait onto her back. i literally just dropped down, took a moment to pause and ran like hell. i was hoping it all happened so fast that she didn't see me but... suprise!!!! she did! she was fine other than a couple of stitches but regardless i got dumped üòï tl;dr got horny and got caught by girlfriends mum who went crazy. i escaped out of the windows drop kicking my girlfriends mother on the way down... then got dumped üò≠	0
just needed to get my thoughts out, can't take this life anymore i'm done. i don't want to be here anymore, i just can't stand it. i've been dealing with extremely severe physical symptoms of anxiety for years now, and i'm positive it cannot be just anxiety. there must be something wrong with me but no doctors are willing to give me a chance. they all just blame it on stress, sleep, anxiety, etc. i just can't take it anymore! i can't remember the last time i truly felt 100% normal, present, all there. there's always something wrong. my brain feels empty, or my head feels like it's going to explode. my body feels numb, or frigid, or burning hot. it's all wrong üò´ i don't even feel real anymore. i keep hoping one day i'll wake up and somehow i'll feel ok...but sadly i know this is just a fantasy :( every therapist i've ever seen has been totally useless. they all just say to journal, practice mindfulness, yoga...thanks, tell me something i don't know üôÑ i used to look forward to things, handing out with friends, vacations, activities...now i find it so hard to work up the energy to do anything because i just feel like shit all the time physically and mentally. i think about killing myself almost constantly; i really like to take late night walks and these are especially inspiring. seeing all the cars fly by just makes me want to hurl myself in front of one, but i know that this unfortunately isn't a surefire way to go (the speed limit is pretty low, and i feel like the only thing that could make life worse is if i survived an attempt but was confined to a wheelchair or something). i was feeling particularly low today and went to buy razor blades but sadly the store was closed :( but the whole time all i could think about was how much i wanted to die, and what if i didn't waste my time cutting but what if i just threw myself in front of that bus or just laid down in the middle of the road and waited? i guess that's really it. i don't know how much longer i'll last, and there's a lot more to my story but i obviously can't write it all here. thanks :)	1
i shifted focus so, i've been depressed for a long time, a lot of shit happened (and is still happening) plus i have a few diagnosed illnesses and of course the classic: suicidal thoughts i've tried to take my life by pills 3 times, always failed to actually die now i shifted my focus in "life" (can you really call it that?) i realized that with my experience i can help people and i think they noticed. a lot of even old friends hit me up, asking me for advice, wanting to meet up for a hug and a looooong talk, some even confessing to also wanting to commit suicide. as dumb as that may sound: the only thing to give me satisfaction is knowing that i just helped someone, doesn't matter to what degree i've already saved a few people and i'll keep it going, no matter how i get myself, because i'd rather fade away knowing i at least had some impact. try it, talk to the people and try to help them as best as you can, maybe you'll also be able to hold on a bit longer with a purpose like that give the help you want to receive much love to everyone on here ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

update: i [19f] have a crush on one of my regular customers [22-24m] original: <url> hi everyone so i'm back from my last post not really with an update but more a new dilemma. it's been 2 months since i started crushing on customer boy and the feelings are still fkn there but for some reason i just cannot bring myself to ask him out. the last few weeks especially though i've started having actual conversations with him and i'm certain he is flirting back with me now, i know he's interested but i just can't seem to do it however i met this other guy a couple of weeks ago and have been on two dates with him and have been texting him non stop and i reallllly really really like him and get along with him so well and we have so much in common but for some reason i've still got coffee guy at the back of my mind. i found out since my last post what coffee guy does for a job and what his hobbies are and he is literally the polar opposite to me when it comes to interests, to say the least - but every time he comes in i get so giddy and nervous and smiley. what do i do reddit. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i could probably just pursue things with this other guy and it would go really well i think but it's bugging me to think that there might be something amazing there with coffee boy and i don't even know it tl;dr: still head over heels for coffee boy, but have started seeing a new guy who i really like and get along with	0

i gave up on life 5 years ago and don't leave the house because i'm ugly...i'm male, aged 30 (look younger) 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) skinny af lanky with long legs etc, pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin (never touched a girl or even had more than a few words spoken to me by one) so yea in the looks department it's over. i never leave the house and havnt since 2015. between 2012-2015 i had a bar job,i had girls like me and i wasn't ugly to some ppl. i got older and ugly. i met some amazing people but also some horrors. horrible women who'd call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers i worked with. the good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times by a fat ugly overweight bitch. ‚óæheres an example: i serve a table of 6 'ladies' in their 40s food and try being polite and helpfully nice as i can. not one of them says thanks and they practically snatch the cutlery and plates of food from my hands when i pass it to them. when they finished eating a good looking guy i work with went over to get the plates and they stacked the plates up for him we're all saying thanks and we're laughing and joking with him he was there for a few minutes. fucking hags.‚óæ in the end i got fed up and left and havnt left the house since to let ageing hit me like a train. i do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and that's the same, women staring me down because i'm skinny like it's my fault they're fat. other guys i work with staring at me with a 'wtf is that' face and overweight short girls calling me a 'ming' (whatever that means) it's great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and i think 'it's nice when someone looks past what i look like'. it's funny how i succumbed to judging people's niceness to how they judge me on my looks or not. but there isn't many like that about. i eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner i feel better. still hidoeus nevertheless. a comment on here once i asked about my hair one comment said 'he's clearly balding and hidoeus btw' and it got upvoted 17 times. i drink whiskey every night watching cartoons and i'm starting to get chest pains. also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 which is 6 years ago tomorrow. she was gorgeous too. she worked in the bar with me. damn i miss her so bad. take me back to then please i basically live upstairs watching netflix everyday and smoking weed in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or younger/older have looks on their side and a life to go with it. funny how most of them are cocky as hell and very arrogant and the girls love it. i have a friend whos like that he's cocky as hell and thinks every girls he walks past fancies him and you wouldn't believe how the girls love that persona on him too. it's not about getting girls for me, but i could care less about not getting sex tbh etc it's juts the restricted life i have because i'm ugly and seeing good looking dudes treated better even when they're complete cocky arrogant assoles. lookism man	1
i'm ending my life tomorrow. hi. i never thought i'd post on here. i don't even know where to begin. i'm 22. i've suffered from depression for as long as i can remember, and have had suicidal thoughts since i was 10. i believe i have bpd, but it hasn't been diagnosed. i've attempted suicide a handful of times but never succeeded, mostly because i wasn't 100% committed to the idea. i don't have a bad life. i'm not close to my family, but we're not estranged either. my parents love me, but didn't really know how to handle my emotional issues and i never got the help i needed when i was a child, so i've been trying to play catch up on my own since i've had access to resources. medications don't work. therapy doesn't work. meditation doesn't work. healthy diet and exercise doesn't work. i'm at a loss for what to do. i was bullied severely as a child and i thought, once that stopped, i'd be happy. but i wasn't. then i was fighting with my parents all the time, and i thought once i moved out and went to college, i'd be happy. i wasn't. i went to school for 3 years but then dropped out because my depression got in the way. i lost all my friends and my apartment and i recently had to move back home. since the beginning of this year, i've moved back in with my parents, my car has broke down for the third time, i've started a miserable job i'll probably be stuck in the rest of my life, and worst of all, this week i lost my best friend of 7 years. she was the most important person in my life. my soulmate. she's cut off all contact with me and i don't blame her. i was so motivated at the start of this year to be a better person but without her by my side, i don't want to be anything. all the color has drained from the world. i can't eat. i can't sleep. and it's not her fault i feel this way. it's the realization that i'm such a terrible person that the best friend i've ever known, who's been there through thick and thin, who just the night before she stopped talking to me was telling me how everything was going to be okay, could completely cut me off. i hurt her so bad that all the promises of our future together are no more. and i cannot forgive myself for that. i'm going to make an exit bag, but a real shitty one since i have no car to go get supplies. i only have stores i can walk to available to me. i just so happened to find out i have the day off work tomorrow, so my parents will leave me at home alone before they go off to work. i'll then go pick up my supplies and come home and hopefully within the hour i'll be gone. i don't know why i'm writing this out. i guess i want to tell someone. it seems weird to die and just not say goodbye. so. goodbye. if it doesn't work or i change my mind, i'll update by saturday night and let everyone know. if i don't update, you'll know it worked. i just want to urge anyone out there who's thinking of suicide... please, don't do it. i know i sound like a hypocrite but one day everything's going to work out for you, no matter what you're dealing with. the world wouldn't be the same without you in it. i'm sure after i'm gone, there will be people who will wish i hadn't done it. but i'm being selfish. i don't want to suffer anymore. don't make my same mistake. thank you for taking the time to read my post. it's good to know my final thoughts will be read by someone. üñ§	1

i have lost all my important friendships i am sorry if this is long.üòè ever since i was a teenager i have struggled with finding friends. (i am 27, or 28 in a month.) üòï happily, i found a few close friends through my current education (social work), not to mention a distant close friend (300 km away) i have had since i was 16--they are all wonderful people üôÇ but in the middle of my education, severe anxiety problems came to me; not the first time, but now i had more people around my life who weren't used to it. and neither was i used to having real-life friends i can confide in. but apparantly i took this too far üòè i hurt them all in different ways; but ultimately, it was because of my incessant need to reach out when i am anxious. one of them told me to never speak to her again. two others just stopped answering when i write to them. the first mentioned hurts the most; we wrote our bachelor thesis together. we couldn't finish it the first semester (in july), so we had to finish it in the second instead (in january). i feel i am mostly to blame, but i honestly do not know. all i know is that i took all the blame; she thinks i am thoroughly selfish. it is a messy story, and the more i think about it, the less i know the truth of it all. üòè now they are gone from my life; i am all alone. (there is one exception; a distant friend in canada who i chat regularly with; there are also childhood friends who make me feel even more alone; bad acquantainces.) i worry about my education, friendships, my mental health. i recently started taking antidepressants, but i stopped taking them two weeks ago because i feel strange on them. but i am seeing a counselor on monday, so i will tell her this then. but right now? i think i want to die; i am so tired of struggling. all i have wanted are friends; i feel like crying whenever i walk outside and i see groups of people walking together, laughing. why must it be so difficult? a little more than a year ago i thought my social life was finally puzzling itself together, but now i think it is hopeless. my thought right now is that i want to jump from a building, but perhaps the only thing that keeps me from suicide is that the tallest building i can access (and second tallest in my city) is only 8 floors tall. but it hurts so much, and i keep thinking that maybe i am lucky and i will go unconscious immediately.	1

i didn't go through with iti made a post here the other day when i was in a really bad place. i ended up not being able to find my dad's gun lol so i decided to get drunk instead. i think i'm okay now, for the most part. i spoke to my psychiatrist and she got me scheduled for weekly sessions with my therapist. i don't know what i hoped to accomplish with my post. i was very angry and in despair. i didn't think anyone would actually care and reach out to me, but through that post i ended up making a really good friend, so it went much better than i expected. i just thought i'd let y'all know that i'm okay and i appreciate everyone who reached out to me and was concerned. thanks. üòÑ	1

i am developing strong feelings for my brother in laws best friend, what do i do? okay so, i am helpless somewhat recently, i (üö∫) have been developing very serious feelings for my sisters boyfriends best friend. i have known this guy for almost three years now (through european scouts) and i've always found him an amazing person. he's very sweet, smart and i love spending time with him. we have a lot in common so our conversations can be so great. not to mention he's the funniest guy i know i kid you not. but a while ago i guess i realised exactly how much of an amazing person i find him. i can't get him of my mind anymore and its driving me a little crazy. first i assumed it was just a little crush that would burn out soon, but i think its turning into something a lot more then that. now, the main issue, the age-difference. i am 15 and he's 19. i very much realise how this can be a problem. we're both at a very different stage in our lives and there's a big chance it wouldnt work out well etc. i get that, and if it was just a small crush i would have let it go and try to move on because i understand the difficulties the age-difference can bring. but like i said i'm positive it's more serious then that and ive really tried to let go but not one day has passed without him on my mind. i have no idea opbouw he feels about me. i'm afraid he might look at me like a younger sister, or his best friends younger sister. but i don't think it's impossible that he could feel the same way as me. definitely not saying i'm like an expert in body-language or behaviour at all, but i tend to always focus a lot on little things people do and what it means (i'm a major over-analyser and over-thinker) and from what i notice he's definitely not appalled by me when we're hanging out so idk. another little issue: i dont know if this is still the case but he used to have/has feelings for another girl (his age), but that's been going on for while and she made it quite clear that she's not romantically interested in him. tl;dr: i have strong feelings for an older friend (15 and 19) and i know how the age can be an issue but i cant just drop it. what should i do? should i confront the guy and tell him how i feel, or should i wait? should i drop it? (not sure if i just can tho) should i tell my brother in law? (i normally really trust him with stuff like this and he can be a big help but i'm not sure this time, considering its his best friend) i really dont know what to do, but it feels like i should really do at least something because my mind has been occupied by it 24/7 and it has been making me very distracted and sad. thank u in advance to take the time to help	0

i'm (24f) worried that my friend (24f) has schizophrenia and/or is in a horrible situation. she lives far away with two kids and i don't know what to do. my friend and i have been friends since kindergarten. we had our ups and downs but for the most part we have always been extremely close. i knew she had some issues, but as a kid it never really pieced together. it was just some small weird conspiracy theories and paranoia - nothing that i was really alarmed at. i will do my best to summarize here. she met a guy when she was 19 and he was 27. red flag for me right off the bat. at this time i had moved across the country so note that all updates were from her perspective. they would do crack together and i think this fucked a lot with her head. eventually he convinced her to have a child, and they did. things were going okay, but she seemed to be raising the kid more or less on her own and working her ass off. eventually they had a second kid. during their relationship she would bring up how he cheated a couple of times and honestly i just never liked the guy. never really got to talk to him but he never gave me good vibes. he seemed to want to avoid me, but i was her best friend. she said he would keep her from staying over at my place because he thought she'd cheat on him. weird shit like that. anyways, fast forward 5 years. i noticed her and her boyfriend kind of fell off all social media, but she was still connected to facebook messenger so i asked if everything was okay. the response i got still has me in shock. she asked me if anyone asked about her, and mentioned she can't trust anyone. i told her it's fine and she can trust me (in saying that, i feel bad posting about this here, but it's pretty anonymous..). this led her onto a tangent of how she found out that her boyfriend is in a satanic cult. he was performing the "sick ritual" on her (this is the only part i can remotely believe - i guess it is something to do with grooming someone to be so involved in the relationship they don't notice other things like the person being in a satanic cult ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). she said he gave her an evil eye to follow her. that he was fucking his ex so that her kids would be all three of theirs. that he was sucking energy from her and her son to bring back his miscarried child from a past relationship. she randomly throws in "the butterfly drop effect" and "tesla's 3 6 9" theory as if this had anything to do with the conversation (i googled them and they don't seem relevant at all - this is a symptom of schizo afaik). she went to go and get her kids baptized because of this. there is more concerning things, but i will try to keep this short and i think that gives you a good idea. i told her to gather evidence. she said "they do this in a way so it looks normal but i know the true meaning" and "he is denying everything so everyone thinks i'm crazy". i feel so lost and helpless right now. her kids are 1 and 3 years old and are now on their own with her. which means they are either with a mentally unstable parent, or they are being sought after by her mentally unstable now-ex boyfriend. like i said... i'm just lost. i don't know how i can help her. i don't know if i can. i just don't want her or her kids to get hurt. tl:dr; i think my childhood best friend either has schizophrenia or similar, or her ex is crazy and might hurt her and their two children. i'm across the country and feel helpless. how do i handle this?	0

yikes, i am getting a tad reckless on my spending. i have never been much of an impulse buyer because i usually wasn't making much. but i recently (about 6 months ago) got a job that uses my degree, and i still live at home, rent free. it's not like i'm in over my head or anything, but i feel like i really should try to focus on saving up more. but between having an interest in video games and one particular board game, i end up spending a lot of money. wondering if anyone can relate with me on this. any tips on how to save money? on a side note, has anyone heard of zombicide? üòÖ	0

rip subway's $5 footlongs. i'm super sad over this. has anyone else enjoyed these cheap sandwiches as much as me? i went to find a subway near me and looked at the online ordering. wait..black forest isn't $5.,,meatball isn't $5...the damn cold cut combo...subway's cheapest sub ever, is now $6.75..whats going on here?!? so, naturally, i goog'd it. [i found articles like this one](<url>)..:spoiler alert... they're gone! üò≠üò≠üò≠ the ceo says the company will no longer promote the $5 foot long, and leaves the option of pricing them at 5$ to the individual stores. so perhaps your local store has them still. there's one store within a 20 mile radius of me that has 1 sub at $5...meatball marinara (drooolüòç). shocking. my gf and i live very cheaply; mostly because i'm on ssdi. we're surly broke and have a tiny amount of free cash, $11, that would've fed us both the delicious subway offerings. but, "noooo", says the ceo. "you guys go buy a package of bologna and some bread and cheese. no condiments allowed because you can't afford it" says the ceo. "eat that pig brain and processed cheese sammich that's dry af because...no condiments!" "hahahahahaaa!!!" that isn't a direct quote but basically what he's saying. is anyone else upset over this? we eat subway once or twice a month and it's the only "going out food" we get to enjoy. gone now is that tradition...sigh.... üò¢	0

did i 19f ruin it with 24m 3 months ago: 19f met 24m john on dating site. my ex had cheated so i was openly looking for fwb. eventually john asked me to hang out but i told him i was no longer looking for anything. he was disappointed but understanding. we met up anyway as friends and this is complicated but that night his friend did something to me (starts with r, automod won't let me say it). john was very supportive, but a bit wary (it happened after he left). i didn't really talk to john for a month. he continuously asked me to spend time with him. he said he wanted to get to know me, and he said it would help me face what happened. about a month after the r, my friends and i were going to a concert and had one extra ticket so i invited john. one of my friends with into me and showing it too much, even though i had repeatedly enforced my boundaries previously. he kept trying to hold my hand, walk with me to the bathroom, etc. apparently, john kept asking our 3rd friend if me and this guy were dating. later that night john tried to kiss me but i said i'm not ready to be anything but friends. later that week john texted and said he can't stop thinking about me and he has a crush on me which he said he hasn't had in a long time. we hung out a few times the next few weeks but he kept asking to have sex and i wouldn't. i told him i was scared it would become complicated, and he said we'll probably both get feelings so that's good, not complicated. he also said it would be hard for him if we didn't have sex so he'd have to retrain himself to see me as a friend and didn't know if he could go back. he also kept saying he still wants to be friends with me because i'm really chill/smart/etc. he constantly compliments my personality. he also often asked me if me and the friend from the concert are a "thing" and if we are hooking up. he knew at this point that when we met in person, i had just ended a semi-dating/sex thing with a guy after a few months, and that after the r i had been, and still was, sleeping with a friend to get over it, but he knew it was not the friend from the concert eventually we started hanging out more. we got drunk and had sex. he continued acting the same to me. one of his friends got a crush on me, and john went out of his way to stop letting me and his friend hang out. he even tried to avoid us getting a glimpse of each other in the parking lot . then, john said one night, "i'm starting to like you as more than a friend but i'm scared of commitment." the next time we hung out, i said 2 things: i said "we don't have to hang out every day you're not obligated" because we had been hanging out daily and i didn't want him to get bored. the thing is i believe this jolted him into trying to start a career . i'm in school and have a good job and he has a degree and a retail job but has trouble getting a career job. the second thing is i asked him if he wanted to talk about the relationship thing. he said he didn't have much to say, and he said i'm obviously not ready to have a relationship yet (with the r, and recent abusive relationships that i mentioned in passing, and because i had told him before i need to work on myself before i can date). he asked if i would want to be friends even if he eventually dated someone else because he said he does like me but he doesn't know about waiting. i got sad and said that would be hard. anyway ,after that night he only asked me to hang out maybe twice a week, and he went from always answering texts immediately, to taking 30 minutes to answer every text. however he did initiate a long texting conversation with me the next night. now i believe he was acting distant because of my hanging out daily comment, and he didn't want to seem like a loser. but at the time, i got a bit freaked out because i thought i had scared him off with the relationship talk. i texted him a few times to ask and i sent too many messages and acted too nervous. i came off clingy/attached/paranoid. he said it was fine. the next time we hung out i asked him about it and he first said i was "scaring" him by saying that us not hanging out as often made me paranoid about us, but then he said he understood in the context of the conversation/texting/etc. then he said maybe we shouldn't sleep together if i'm going to get attached. i said that then my fears were correct and he said that it's ok, we can keep sleeping together and just take it one day at a time. then we hung out again and he acted normal like always, even though his texting/schedule was still off. he doesn't say my name during sex anymore though like he used to. he saw that my friend from the concert had texted me a bunch, and i didn't want him to be scared off, so when i got home i texted him to say that i had a good time and also explained that "this is irrelevant to you but he and i aren't a thing, just clearing that up" because he had previously asked about it repeatedly. the next morning he woke up and didn't answer my text at all. he sent me a meme that he found that morning like probably an hour after waking up but he never addressed the other text. i brought it up and he really seemed to want to avoid the conversation, i asked him if he saw it and he just said "yea i saw it this morning". i said "i just thought you might want me to clear that up" and he eventually said "yea thank you for clearing it upüôèüèªüôèüèªüòä". now i asked him to hang out again 2 days later but he's on a trip, idk for how long. he vented to me for like 1 text about how the trip was going badly but then had to go. he said he'll hit me up when he gets back is this ruined? what's going on here? did i ruin his feelings for me, and did he have any in the first place? what can i do to get it back to how it was? tldr: guy was super into me even after sex, he brought up feelings, i freaked out and acted clingy/paranoid for a week, he seems distant but not gone, what's going on and is it reversible?	0
i donated blood for the first time today! as the title says i donated blood for the first time today! i was a little nervous but more for it being a new situation as things like needles don't bother me. as experiences go, it was pretty pleasant and all the staff were so lovely. i would highly recommend that's if you are able to donate blood, that you do. you never know when you might need it and you can really help someone out in there time of need. ‚ò∫Ô∏è	0
trusting a gas station grocery bag... fuck! stopped at a gas station on the way home from a long day bc out of milk (and don't really have anything else to drink either except alcohol). decided to also buy a cold bottle of wine and chips and salsa bc i have velveeta in the fridge. got home, husb carried in milk. i had everything else in another bag, but the shitty gas station bag was insufficient. salsa fell thru bag, i tried rearranging to save the wine. not quick enough. wine fell. salsa and wine shattered on sidewalk in front of house. üò©	0

a tragic story tonight is when it happened ... in fact it was only moments ago it all started when i was chilling in my room watching netflix. that's when i saw it. a motherfucking fly snuck into my room. i knew what i had to do, so i a armed myself with the best weapon in my room : the notebook i use for my physics class. i turned off all the fans in my room so no air current would frighten it. i then proceeded to patiently wait in the middle of my room, waiting for it to stop flying around and settle down on one of the surfaces that composes my room. for many minutes i awaited the moment, but thy moment in fact did not came. since i was no amateur i knew what i had to do next. i adjusted my strategy : instead of obliterating it i decided to let it live ... but and only but if it left my room peacefully. i then opened my door wide open, killed the lights, illuminated the restroom and left to get a quick snack. after grabbing a half empty bag of doritos‚Ñ¢Ô∏è i came back to the few squares meters that i use as my own living space. i lifted the tiny lever on the wall and thus there was light! that's when i saw it. the fucking fly. my ultimate, most noble of all, opponent. i guess that the darkness i created gave it a false feeling of security during my departure. i swiftly grabbed my notebook, took my time to aim because i knew it was my only chance, quickly chanted in my mind ''if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip? his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, there's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti. he's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready'' (a mighty ballad to give me courage and strength in this trying time). afraid of missing my shot i then struck with all the force that the gods handed me. it didn't fly away. my target had been eliminated. i lifted the killer pile of paper and that's when i saw it. it fucking exploded. it was absolutely everywhere on the previously clean and white wall. i grabbed a kleenex‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and began the cleaning deed. unfortunately that action only spread the damn bug and created an even bigger area of insect flesh and organs. i cleaned betterly and that was it. now, if ya'll don't mind, we'll move on to the funeral service. first of all, i would like to say some words. i'll begin that thanking you all for coming, i know it would mean a lot to it if it was here today. i didn't get to know it very well, but i definitely met it at its prime. when i first saw it it was fluttering gracefully. i don't know if it was out of joy or out of fear, but it sure as hell was beautiful. in fact, for the majority of the time i knew it it was flying, i only saw it land once and, unfortunately, it died quickly succeeding this moment of peace for it. at least we will know that it was a good death for it. on top of that, let's never forget that bits of it will alway be with us on my physics notebook. once again, thanks for coming, thanks for listening to me and i'd like to finish this ceremony by playing [its favorite song](<url>)	0

19m not much experience with women but i like a 18f (more info in actual post) so starting off for some context, i am possibly one of the most worst people with this kind of stuff, my dumbass literally never had a significant other/partner because i didn't care about that shit till about 16/17 years old. i have a chronic stammer (similar to a stutter but instead of repeating the same word, i just can't say the word and just repeat the syllable till i can actually say it, this will be important later) i am also live on my college campus, so... on with the post! this girl i like i met through my group of friends, she's always been friendly and quiet. seems like a nice person in general. she had this flier for her friends party on her social media page (i also never go to parties, never got drunk, high etc...) i didn't think of it much at first, but i saw her walk by on campus and she said hi to me then asked if i was coming to the party, i told her i'm not sure because i might go home for the weekend (i wasn't too into her at this point but i was still into her if you get what i mean). i thought about it and after a while i was like "fuck it just go", i went to my nearby target and bought a polo for the night. that same night i added a post on my one page dropping my username on my other social media, and she was one of the few people who added me that night. i was like "oh cool", probably doesn't mean shit don't get too hyped about it buddy. we talked a little before the party, just random talk etc... but onto the party. i go to the roommate with my party we get there early and get "drinks", not enough to get smashed but later the girl i like comes to the party and after a little while i ask her if she can get us some drinks, because we hadn't had any in a while. well here's where it gets interesting, i get smashed for the first time and i'm like, "oh shit this is fuckin awesome!" i'm the opposite of myself, i can actually speak without fumbling on my words, my confidence is shooting through the roof, i'm talking to random people (another thing i don't do), i slightly stumble while walking etc... we eventually go back to the dorms we live at not getting caught, relax for like 30 mins, see the girl texts me "wya" or something like that, i say at the dorms and tell her my room number, and surprisingly she comes in like 5-10 minutes or something. we get to our room and we're just talking, nothing stupid. we get to the topic about her and her past bf's, she said she had 2 and she just got out of one recently within a month or so, but she still has her "card" if you know what i'm talking about. and throughout this whole conversation my confident ass is making compliments like, "you looked really good tonight" etc and other stuff like that. just being a stupid drunk dickhead, not sure if she was smashed or whatever, didn't seem like it but she saw i clearly was. she goes on and says she doesn't like guys who get with chicks just to smash and mentioned my roommate does shit like that. then as she's leaving i give her a hug and tell her thanks for tonight and i jokingly say (holy fuck i'm cringing typing this) "can i get a kiss" and she just laughs and brushes it off and politely says no. i texted her later for her number on social media, i went to bed and she gave me her number in the morning and she said, "i take a while to text because i'm busy a lot üò≠" or something along the lines of that (she does work a lot though so that's what's giving me hope). i texted her in the morning saying "i'm so sorry for being a drunk dumbass last night, it was my first time." and she said its ok its a new day today, something like that, we talk and stuff etc... which leads me to where i'm at now, i didn't think of it in the morning but i think she said she takes a while to text back, just to curve me. i'm super shitty with this stuff so of course the good side of me is saying have some hope you dumb fuck while the other side is saying you done fucked it up. opinions? tldr, i got invited to party to one of my female friend's party, got smashed for the first time, went back to my dorm, she also came back to my dorm room and we talked, i said some questionable things and compliments and came off strongly while under the influence, she gave me her number but said her text back game is weak, but still talks to me, part of me thinks she curved me and another part ones to just have hope. i still feel stupid for coming off strong because i literally have no confidence when i'm not drunk and wouldn't say those things if i was drunk.	0

this is a clusterfuck in my head and i just want it to go away. please help :( this is a long one, but the read is much appreciated. scroll down for summary if you need! i've been living with my best friend since july 2018. my fiance moved in with us unofficially in december (unofficially meaning not on the lease). since then, my views of my best friend have started to change. i'm starting to realize the negative impact she's making in my life and in my home and though to some it may seem like little things, little things pile up, especially when the shit piles on every day. our lease is up on april 30th and i had all intentions with renewing with her, however, when my fiance applied for the apartment (since we wanted to do it right and not "illegally"), he got declined because of some previous collections he owed. this is the only apartment complex who's denied him ever, even with his collections. so, we took that as a wake up call...there's a reason he got declined. and i'm definitely not comfortable keeping him here whilst not on the lease because then we risk eviction if they find out he's living here since we're already on the radar now. that all being said, we've decided to move out of this place to be closer to our schools and closer to the mountains. but, we don't want her coming with us. i'm scared shitless to talk to her about it because we have to let the apartment complex know by april 1st if we are vacating and i'm not sure what she's gonna wanna do. i don't want to make her feel lost and left behind, but i know i need to do what's best for me. she's filled with negative energy, always brings shit we don't need into the house, clutters the place up after we've worked hard decluttering it, and gets really snippy and frustrated about the silliest things (and it always feels directed at someone). she was great for my high school growing period, but now that i'm maturing and growing into an adult (and she's okay with staying miserable), i really don't think living with her or being her best friend is good for me anymore. on another note! with me and my fiance moving out, we're getting a place together..just the two of us. and as of lately, i've felt like my love for him is changing. i don't know if it's lessening, or i'm just entering into a new stage of maturity and appreciation for love, but i feel like we're entering partnership love. where we know each other inside and out, we support each other on a daily basis, and we're just used to each other. which is all okay, but is my love fading? or just growing? we've been arguing quite a bit recently, and i think it might be directly correlated with our living situation, but because of my best friend situation, i'm just second guessing everything. doubting myself. questioning everything i've ever held dear in my life. i don't know. i'm just extremely unsure at this stage of the game. *summary*: my fiance and i are moving out of me and my best friend's apartment to pursue a simpler way of living. i'm scared of her reaction. i'm also scared that my love for my fiance is fading, or just growing into a more mature love. can anyone help rearrange my head? üòì	0
curious about garage door i literally don't kno what subreddit to put this in so i'm just putting it here bc idgaf. ok,,, so when the garage door goes up at my house, obviously i then kno someone just came home. the garage door is loud and you can hear it from every room in the house. lately (the past year or 2? idk) sometimes someone will come home and i won't hear the garage door. i'll just hear the door to the house open and them walking in and know they're home. yesterday i was sitting in the kitchen when the garage door opened, and i was right next to door,,, but the sound was so faint i almost didn't notice it at all. my dad was sitting there and he confirmed he could barely hear it either. then my mom walked into the house. so how come all my life my garage door has been loud but lately every once and a while you can't even hear it? thnx 4 reading. ik this is random and stupid üíìüíìüíì	0
i really can't do thisimagine being 20 years old, having no social life, no friends, never having dated or kissed anyone, having hardly experienced anything that normal people do, living with your parents, being unable to drive, having to get rides from your parents to and from your shitty grocery store job, being on the verge of dropping out of college, and spending 99% of your free time sleeping because you can't stand being awake. bonus points if you imagine your family members giving you the silent treatment whenever you show any emotion that isn't ass-kissing super happy manic pixie dream girl without a mind of her own. well...... i don't have to imagine because that's my life üéâ and i can't wait until i muster up the courage to end it because i spend every night sobbing and having panic attacks because i genuinely can't believe this is my life. i wasted all my teenage years doing nothing and i'm never going to get that back. i'll just get older and my circumstances will become more and more pathetic and disturbing. no thanks. i'm hoping with everything in me that i can be gone before the end of january	1

dear dad*dear dad* *i guess me calling you dad would shock you. i always called you by name because mum forced it on me.* *i remember you admitting you'd punched her in the face. i remember you admitting to your criminal record. i remember that honesty was something you valued highly. and even though i don't condone domestic abuse or violence, i know how twisted and cruel mum can be. i understand.* *i don't remember you that well. after what happened i blocked you out. i was obsessed with being strong and cold. i never spoke of you, well i never initiated it to anyone for years.* *but i do remember us going out to the zoo. to the swimming baths. to the cinema. to blackpool. caravans. i remember that i was too damaged and mentally ill to form a relationship with you. i desired the closeness but because of my mothers interference and how she poisoned me against you... i guess i was too young to even understand what i was doing.* *but i miss sharing a bed. i still remember being 5 years old and us arguing about who would sleep on the couch. i felt bad and refused to let you sleep on the couch whilst i got the bed. eventually we were both too stubborn to do anything so we shared the bed. that was our tradition, until the end.* *i'd wake up to see you looking at me. you had the most beautiful blue green eyes. sometimes you'd hold my hand as i slept. it happened quite often. we'd lay awake each night in the dark. holding hands lying on our backs and we'd just talk. near the end you seemed to be getting depressed. sleeping a lot. but i still would sometimes wake up with my hand sweaty from yours and your face inches from mine. even when i would wake up to see your eyes shut, you quite often would wake up a moment later and stare into my eyes. i haven't ever seen so much love in someone's eyes that way before. i never saw anybody look at me the way you did, i doubt anybody would love me anywhere near as much as you did. i will never forget it. it breaks my heart every time i recognise that expression in other fathers of young girls* *i remember at 12yrs old when i got my first bra and period you talked about no longer sharing a bed. i vehemently refused to sleep apart and so we continued our tradition.* *i know bits about you now. how you desired to be loved. how much you fought at court to see me. how much you loved me and wanted me to love you the way other kids love their parents. that's why you got engaged to that cunt who hated me.* *at 18 you met a woman you loved with a young boy. you were a kind thoughtful man. well known for being generous and would do anything for a stranger. i saw numerous times you doing selfless things for strangers. you were incredibly kind. you did a year or so in prison for breaking into a supermarket one night and stealing. you gave the money to a friend hoping he'd give her the money. he didn't. when you came out of prison you continued to support her and your "son". you only broke up i believe because she cheated on you. as a teenager you stayed with a woman, went to prison and helped raise a boy who wasn't yours. i won't pretend you were a saint because you weren't, but you certainly wasn't bad* *anyways* *you had just turned 42 earlier that month, and i was 12. it was 2010 and you were in your long term girlfriends house. it was around 1am and you apparently heard a noise in the back garden. you were brave and loyal and caring. careless and impulsive, you did what many people would do for somebody they loved, or thought they loved. you tried to protect them, you opened the door.* *that was when you were murdered. september 2010. you were hit in the head with some pipe. then stabbed in the heart. that was you... over. gone.* *your fiance went into your flat later that day. if i remember correctly she took your mattress and your washing machine. she also took pictures you wanted me to have, other sentimental things that were of no value. to spite my family.* *i was a mentally ill 12 year old in a special needs school who cut themselves and had attempted suicide 10 months earlier. i came home to see my paternal grandmother with my maternal grandfather. mum was crying. my grandmother explained what happened. i got into my mother's lap and cried after. * *a few were arrested. we pushed for the police to do more. i found out you sold cannabis, though only to people you knew well. after we complained again the police threatened to release the information about your criminal activity to the public.* *when a parent is murdered the child receives money when they get older. if that parent has a criminal record then you aren't entitled to it i wasn't.* *it took weeks for the funeral to take place because of the evidence. i became extremely close to one of your brothers.* *the case was shut soon after. nobody was ever caught. it's still unsolved and will always be unsolved. i'm sorry dad, i wish there was justice for you. but there never will be. i'm so so sorry* *life got harder, dad. my boyfriend sexually assaulted me at 13. i held a man whilst he died of a heart attack. i continued to cut myself. i overdosed again at 13. at 15 my mother threw me out and your brother took me in and raised me. we're so close these days. he is like a father to me. he's not able to show love like you were. but now i can express love. i wish i had been able to do this whilst you were alive. it kills me to think you didn't feel loved by me before you died. the guilt and self hatred and loneliness is so bad that it took years for me to face it* *i admit i started abusing drugs at 15. i'm a drug addict now at 20. i have more than 300 scars over my body. my legs, arm, shoulder and chest.* *i also got piercings. i have 10 currently. if you knew where some of them are you'd cringe üòâ. i don't think you would of liked the woman i've become. but i think you'd understand why i'm such a mess. i miss you so much. i lost the only happy optimistic person ever. my life has a permanent dullness that i need to escape from anyway necessary* *i know if you had been alive you wouldn't of let my mum put me into a care home. you made the right choice asking your brother to take me in. he's treated me so well.* *i'm 20 now. i have a boyfriend of 4 months. i'm unemployed and on benefits, but i know that's not forever. i'm getting my own place soon. i plan to make a little place in my flat dedicated to you.* *i love you with all my heart. i know you loved me too. your murder broke me and changed me completely. i'll forever be devastated.* *but i'm getting better. one day i hope i can be the kind of woman you'd be proud to call your daughter. i'll be bringing my boyfriend around to your grave again around your birthday. nobody should celebrate their 50th alone.* *love from e*	1
let me help you :)i promise this is not just a shameless plug. ive been suffering with suicidal ideation for the last 5 years, been hospitalized 4 times, done php 3 times and almost attempted 2 times. throughout that whole time one of the things that sucked the most was how isolated i felt. weird. out of place. not-normal. people at school always staring and whispering. well i am done. we are not freaks. i have taken one for the team haha and i have created a tik tok account [my tik tok](<url>) where i am openly joking about inpatient and antidepressants and mental health. it helps me in time of deep depression to be creative and i believe it will help you laugh a little bit and probably ease some of the pain :) again, not tryna be famous i just literally actually have 0 friends and mental health communities make me feel less alone ü•∞	1

what do i (32f) say to my dad (67m) who drives for lyft and hurts for money more than i do, when he asks what i want for my birthday? my dad and i live across the country from each other. my mom and him split a decade ago. my dad doesn't have a lot of money, in fact he doesn't know i know this but he could lose his house. he is almost 70 and working just to get by. i wish i could support him but i'm a teacher and trying to start a family of my own. my mom helps, i know, even though they aren't together. anyways, i definitely don't want him spending money on me, i have everything i need really, but he has his pride. not sure now to put it to him. need some help with wording ideas! tl;dr: dad wants to get me a birthday present, don't want him spending money on me, what to say ü§î	0

how i got shit all over myself this morning üôÉ oh, hi. i have a story you're gonna love. it's about how i accidentally smeared shit all over myself this morning. i woke up super early with the urgent need to poop due to eating half a pizza and half a box of oreos last night. i sit on the toilet, and on the ground i see a tiny little bug, so i squish it with a kleenex. oddly enough there is no dead bug on the ground, and no dead bug on the kleenex. whatever! i proceed to have explosive diarrhea. fast forward to wiping time. as i go to wipe my ass, mid-wipe i look down.... there is the bug on my leg it stealth climbed up me and is now running around on me in a panic. in this moment, i instantly forget i am wiping explosive munchies poops off myself, and my hands start flailing to smack the bug off of me. with dirty toilet paper in hand. and that, people of reddit, is how i ended up with shit all over myself this morning. thanks for coming to my ted talk. tl;dr - bug scared me, poo everywhere.	0

almost burning my house down so me and a few mates were outside by the pool having a bit of a drink. it started to get bit chilly so we decided to get a bonfire going... problem was we had fire wood but no fire starters. we thought we pulled it off by lighting a piece of cardboard but the flame was going out and at this point we were freezing our asses off. we were getting frustrated.... so my friends decide that it's a great idea to pour some petrol in. fuck yeah it worked!...for a second then it died again üòí so we poured a little more in. (this is where it all went to shit) out of no where the can was engulfed in flames... at this point everyone's yelling at me to throw it into the pool before it blows up but no that didn't happen? why... because i couldn't bare to clean the pool afterwards (laziness >my life, good prioritising ey) so instead i instinctively slowly place the flaming canister on the ground. surprisingly, i was pretty calm about the impending explosion. i casually walked and got a bucket of water thinking it would easily fix the problem... i was wrong. instead the water somehow managed to spread the fire across the tiled ground, right next to the gas bottle by the bbq... can't get any worse huh . at this point you have my sister looking out the window with a phone in her hand, calling the fire brigade. luckily a mate took the initiative and kicked the can into the pool, he's shoe on fire but he saved the house from burning down? safe to say that's last time i'm using petrol. tldr; i'm an idiot and don't mess with fire	0

i'm giving up trigger warning hi .. before i start talking about everything i want you to know that i'm not an open person at all. everything happens to me, i keep it inside of me, i don't share at all. because i believe that i'm a strong person and i don't need anyone and no one can help me .. and me posting and writing about me right now means i have reached my maximum desperation level. suicide is easier for me than talking about what's on my mind. but here i am talking .. i have attempted suicide on 1st april 2018 i hanged myself with the belt and i passed away for few minutes, the house was empty my brother got home and he managed to save me. before doing this attempt i was thinking all the time in every way that i could have a reason that i'm not seeing to be alive, even after attempting suicide i still think that i should do it again. to be honest my mom gonna travel in april again and the house gonna be empty and i'm preparing myself for committing suicide again and for the last time. the reason is i have nothing, no life no help no reason no job no college i can go to really nothing and if you wanna know why and how, it's simple. it's because i live in iraq. i been living in iraq since the day i was born and that is my curse i been trying to leave since the moment i started walking. iraq passport is before the last worst passport in the world. baghdad the capital is the worst city in the world to live in since 2016, i guess. there's no chance for me here, i tried and believe me when i say it i tried everything to leave to run away to work to find new ways but there's always a close road for me. i can't find another place to live in üòî i have no life here. no father. he left us since i was 9 years old. when i was 9 i was scared and sad because that happened so i started to listen to english music, basically eminem and i fell in love with him even tho i don't know what he was saying so i promised myself to learn the language and understand every song he makes. that's how i speak english now. also it is my curse to be honest because english made me what i am now. open minded guy who thinks and knows many things who knows how stupid and ignorant his community is who knows how everyone around is so dumb and not humans at all because no one here talk about emotions. no one care no one thinks about the other i learned a lot because of my english language and i believed when i was a kid me knowing the language and getting better at it will be my ticket out of here. so i kept focusing on it for years every day, every hour in every song. till the moment came and i found out that it's not even my ticket and i can't leave because i only speak english üíî i can't stand spending another year in this place at all. i can't be myself i can't even do my hobbies and find what i'm really good at because there's no right places for such things here. i'm giving up and i don't know it's the end of the line for me here i thought about sharing because i thought maybe nothing is changing because i keep everything inside of me. so here i am .. lost and don't know how to live like a human and at a least have a home. üíî	1

i'm trying to apply for universities, and i'm honestly so overwhelmed. i love music, with all my heart. it's hard to explain it to virtual strangers, but the amount of love i hold for music is honestly unparalleled in my life. my goal in life was always to work in a music-related field, but my parents kind of gently pressured me into a more 'realistic' field, they didn't outright force me, but i'd feel guilty if i didn't do what they said. i'm currently applying to study law, with the goal of eventually studying criminal law and criminology as a master's (we don't do the bar here, we practice civil law here as opposed to common law). i intend to do music-related work on the side, working in record stores, volunteering at festivals, trying to find places to write for, etc. in hopes someone notices, and using law as my safety net. when i told my friend this he told me that it was really sad that i was pursuing something i'm not awfully keen on (law) just because i don't feel my passion is realistic/supported by my family. i guess i just feel bad, if i took a musical road i'd probably end up broke and wouldn't get far, and i'd disappoint my parents. but if i followed law, i wouldn't be as happy because my heart isn't fully there. i guess i'm just lost. edit: it's really late here (nearing midnight) and as much as i know i gotta reply to comments in the next 3 hours, i really can't afford to stay awake 'till 3, as i get up at 6! if anyone comments though, i promise i'll reply first thing in the morning üíñ hoping the mods are cool with that!	0

any suggestions ? i think we all know how depression works. does anyone know how to fix this; so i have friends, sure-- but barely any i trust, and so very little i actually like to hang out with because i don't see them as being real, and most are self absorbed. and yet by my not being their friends, me eating alone and sticking my nose in a book completely alone and ostracizing my self is almost like a barrier from this world, so i don't have to face the real world. deep down i hate it, and i've fallen low before because of this lonely feeling. i don't want that to happen, not again, is there a certain perspective i could keep in mind? i could make friends, but i don't want to, because i know none of them will count. so many people have left me, you see. i don't want to be alone, so i stick my nose in a book. but i also see the truth in how many people in my age group have trouble creating an actual trust worthy friendship, and i don't need any of that. been there, done that. and yet i feel alone, even though i know i'm making the right choice in separating myself from false hope. hopefully the doubt and unwavering pain from my last break doesn't crumble all my walls, god forbid i don't become how i used to be. ‚ù§Ô∏è	1
introducing the bf to reddit nsfw tifu - i love reddit - i'm a whole 6 yrs reddit old. i loose entire night shifts here. in august i met my current bf. i've been talking about reddit to him since early in our relationship. and he often catches me giggling at something and wants to know what it is. and reddit - to the uninitiated can be hard to describe. today he decided to join (for something to do when he has a smoke at work - lmao). i warned him. but he did it anyway. he is u/gdp74 (welcome baby). happy cake day! it took him a total of 8 seconds to find r/trashy and subsequently porn. he's now cruising cat videos. i've lost him. üòÄ [the said link (video in comments)](<url>)	0

(34f) my husband (37m) left his phone at home and i figured out his passcode..not happy with what i saw, have a question for all the guys out there... before i get bombarded with hate about snooping...i was just curious, it's no big deal and he's done it to me before too. we've never cheated on each other (as far as i know lol) so he has this whatsapp group with a group of like 15 friends he's. wen friends with since he was 11, they're very close and go on regular boys holidays once a year. in this whatsapp group there's just a tonne of dirty videos and pictures of girls, and talk g about sex, i know they go to strip clubs, even when they're in holiday but he's always told me it's only when it's a special occasion like a birthday or stag, but reading the messages i think they go strip clubs a lot more then he makes out they do. i don't know why this bothers me, it just does, they talk about local girls they find hot too, and husband has even taken a picture of one of the mums asses and sent it to the whatsapp group when he's been in the school run üòï obviously i can't confront him about it, and i'm not sure if i want to tbh, but i just want to know from all the guys out there... is this normal behaviour fir most guys? knowing the kind of guy he is, i feel like if it was the other way round he'd be fucking fuming.	0

he is my everything. i've had a crush on him for months, i can't get him out of my head, there's no way he's straight. i won't let anyone else have him. he always makes me laugh and smile when i'm around him, when he hugs me, i feel totally safe and calm. i want to be with him forever. he knows i crush on him, but he's doesn't know how much i obsess. id kill someone if if meant i could be with him forever. i love him so much, he's tall, long blonde hair and is tough on the outside but inside he's a real sweetie. i've cut myself because i wronged him, i've written love letters and fanfics. he is my everything and i need to be with him forever. he is the light in my life. -liam üíñ	0

oh, i am done i am in this weird done numb place. i've been here for awhile tbh. all week i have thought about dying and rn i am drunk and it sounds great. bc who would miss me? my fake friends that text me every once in a while to fill their conscience? or my family that let me get abused? so yeah, i think i'm going to try to kill myself again (not my first attempt) and hopefully it's my last üòä i hope you all get what you're looking for in life.	1

i just need something really bad or something a little good. where do i begin? life's been shit since idk ever since i can remember. from family psychological abuse to sexual abuse at work. to failing a semester to uni to two failed attempt at suicide. idk how much worse it can get. can't go back to uni cause i'm on probation. need a full time job but can't get hours therefore no money to even pay my rent and moving bac to my toxic family. tried applied to a bunch of (50+) full time positions with just simple tasks like receptionist. never get a call back. can't even fucking commit a proper suicide. i just don't know what 2019 is gonna bring. nothing brings me joy. i hate this life. i hate living this life. nothing seems to be going even a bit better than yesterday. just broke up with my super successful and supportive boyfriend b/c seeing him get everything in life make me a bit jealous of him. at the same time i can't burden him with my shits anymore. i hurt him really bad just so he stops messaging me. i don't really know where i'm going with this. i just really hope i get a job soon. or i just really wish i succeed in my next suicide attempt. most people look at my life on instagram and think it's the perfect life. sees a fit girl that has the perfect part time job and goes to one of the best uni in the country. only if they knew i m only "fit" b/c i have a severe eating disorder, that my body is cover in scars from self harm. only if they knew my school is going to shit. the irony is my major is mental health. so many people come to me to talk b/c am a good listener and apparently i give decent advice. how is it that i can help everyone but myself? i hate this. god i just wish i died. i just can't do this anymore. the only thing that remotely stops me is my mom. i love her. she lost a girl before about 20 years ago and she's still messed up from it. if i take my own life i know my mom would prob just die as well. sorry just ranting. if you're reading this thank you for taking the time to read it. ‚ù§Ô∏è	0
how to handle anything at all/help parents understand what depression is? so i've been in bed for about 6 days now, have just kind've completely checked out at this point. when i get like this my parents try flipping between compassion and weird motivational speak, but the condescension and animosity they line their phrases with is kind've mind-blowing to be honest. i made the mistake of buying into that bullshit spiel about reaching out‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and telling someone‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è(because my life is so fucking sacred‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ñ¢Ô∏è) by asking my mom if i could see someone asap i get that she and my father are frustrated, i've been through over a half dozen therapists and tried at least a dozen different medications at this point, and i'm a pretty fucking pathetic kid for someone to produce but her response just really sucked. she said there was no use trying any medication or therapy at this point because up till now it hasn't worked, so here on out it's "up to me" whether i live life or not i dont think they're privy to my constant suicidal ideations, but this was really just about the dumbest thing i've heard yet. at least they used to lace their bullshit motivational phrases with less repugnancy "some therapists/meds just aren't a good fit!!" "gotta keep trying!!!!" the notion that i just cherish not having the motivation to shower or leave my bed is frankly the most backwards thing i've heard from them, and really goes to show how little regard they seem to have for mental illness as a whole i would fucking looooooooove to just plaster on a big fucking smile and actually mean it for once, get up in the morning, every morning, and just manage to do something billions of other people seem to flawlessly manage. i would absolutely love this. they flat out said they "[didn't] think i liked to work which is why i was avoiding school" (???) christ so basically there is no more "reaching out" because they're tired of dealing with me. believe me i get it. i'm just grateful no one can say i didnt try. considering they dont seem to be interested in continuing to pursue psychotherapy, because, y'know, we've totally done literally everything medicine has to offer, and at this point i just gotta get my game face on!!! :))))) i get that they're fucking tuckered out, i sure as hell am. but i feel like this at the very least prevents them from license to grieve. because i really do not know what else to do at this point. i would love to be just dandy, i would. but how the fuck? sorry if you've read this far, i assure you that it was a massive waste of your time	1
i (f15) kind of messed up my friendship with my friend (m15) because of my feelings for him. any advice on anything? well, first off, i'll say i've had feelings for him since about, say august 2017? sometime then. yeah it's been long i guess. anyway, a lot of shit has gone down since then. non of which included us getting together. we become pretty good friends over the years. so i'm a sophomore this year and i have exams pretty fucking soon. all i'm trying to do is just get over him so i can try to focus because, at this age it is pretty obvious that a male species would have my full attention. let me just tell you, i cannot concentrate on my life because of this dumb boy. so i asked a few people for advice and i was finally convinced to tell him. with my stupid ass, i decided to text him. yes, i texted him a long ass paragraph explaining my whole life story to him. i switched off my wifi immediately because i was scared off all the possibilities. i couldn't sleep that night so i got up at about 12 am just to see what he said. keep in mine that i was awake all that time thinking up all sorts of replies he would have made. well there is one option that never crossed my mind. that he would reply. guess what happened üòë. he didn't reply. that was a whole day ago. today being friday and just an athletics day at school, he didn't even bother showing up to school as we wouldn't have any classes. so i'm sitting here at 11 in the night thinking of what he might be thinking too. i'm not ok fr. i don't know what to do. this post might just get hidden and buried under so many but if you've reached up to here and have anything to say, please do. i'm open for any sort of criticism. tl;dr: i admitted to liking this boy and he hasn't replied to me ever since then. help üôèüèæ	0

tell me (38f) why i should not blow him (39) up to his girl like an army grenade i always read this in other posts so i'll also ask you to forgive the cell phone formatting. tldr at the bottom. i was seeing a man for four months who was separated legally but still married. in this time, he treated me great. we went out, we had deep talks, we did kind gestures for each other. then after i made a large gesture, he told me he just wanted to be friends. he couldn't give me the relationship i wanted because he was just not ready. he previously told me he saw a future with me so i asked if that was still the case and he said no. this was january 15. it hurt, but i understood. we didn't see each again until a random run-in in early feb. we chatted briefly, he mentioned how great i looked and how nice it was to see me. that was the last contact until this past saturday. saturday night, i went out and when i returned home via uber, i realized i had lost my keys. i couldn't get in my building so i called him at 1:30 am and asked him to let me in. he did and we went to his apartment where i made calls to track down my keys. he was really sweet and tried to make me feel better about being an irresponsible twat for leaving my keys in the first uber i took that night. i was quite intoxicated and i only remember bits and pieces of the night, but i recall him telling me to come close and lay my head on his shoulder. he held me and caressed me just like he used to. we fell asleep together waiting for the uber driver to call back but he didn't until 9 the next morning. i eventually laid down in his bed and when i woke up a few hours later, he was sleeping on the couch. so nothing happened. all night and morning, he continuously made comments about my body in this really sexy dress i was wearing. told me how great i smelled and that he was drooling over me. i shrugged off the comments but laughed and smiled and felt flattered. he drove me one hour to pick up the keys, we had a great time laughing and joking on the ride down and back. i thanked him dozens of times and offered to treat him to dinner. i kissed him on the cheek and went home. the next day, i thanked him again via text and asked him when he wanted to go to the thank you dinner. he said he didn't need to be rewarded because looking at me in my dress was reward enough. cute. then i asked him if we could be friends. here's where shit got real. he became really short and dry with me, taking an hour sometimes to respond. i took this to mean that he didn't want to be friends and offered to just go back to being cordial when we see each other( we live in the same apartment building). he said "we can be friends the way you have described as long as no feelings are involved." clearly i still love the guy, but the tone was just so dry and callous that frankly, it made me reconsider the friendship idea. but, i jokingly asked, "whose feelings are you concerned about, because after the other night, u can't possibly act like you don't have feelings for me! üòù" he proceeded to tell me that he didn't. never did. that i was just a fuck and that he played me and used me. he said he just wanted attention and sex from a pretty woman and that's all it was. i was "in-house pussy", he said. he sprinkled in a few lols just to be sure i knew how much of a joke i was to him. this was via text this morning. i started my day absolutely gutted. i've been crying all morning and i can't stop. the vindictive part of me wants to send all the adulterous texts to his wife. he told me she is requesting alimony and proof of infidelity might get it for her. they were married in a state in which regardless of legal separation, the parties are still legally married and any sexual contact during the separation is adultery. i can prove the contact and fuck him up financially by sharing this with his wife. he hurt me, and he did so maliciously. i have the power to do the same. should i go there, reddit? i'm so hurt and angry inside that someone could do this to person who only showed kindness and love. hurting him is the only thought that gives me any solace right now. what should i do and why? tldr-- legally separated man used me and tossed me aside with malice. i have the means to get revenge by telling his wife about our relationship, almost ensuring that he will be forced to pay her alimony. should i hurt him back or let it go?	0

my girlfriend cheated on me my life has been going down into hell recently everything getting worse and worse.. recently my girlfriend came out to me that she had sex with her friend let's say his name is "alex" she invited him over to just chill i guess i'll never know the full truth but my girlfriend likes to hangout with people she's social and alex broke up with girlfriend not too long ago. so they were laying down watching netflix and he asked to scratch him and she did it because she didn't think nothing of it that's what she told me, then some how i didn't get the full story he unbuckled his pants and started pulling his down and the entire time she's like i don't know about this. he will get hurt, that's what she said and he's like but i want this and then some how they ended up fucking and he cummed and she said she didn't like it, it didn't feel good. and i love this girl... she's so perfect to me i've never trusted someone as much as her or loved and now it's all just gone. i still have feeling for her this all feels fake. that day she was texting me to come over while he was over but i didn't wanna and she told me she was telling to. come over because of what was happening but i didn't wanna i didn't like alex.. and she didn't tell me the day after or the day if i literally picked her up after he left and everything seemed so normal for a whole week until she told me.. i'm so broken, i wish i could just end everything but i know life has it's up and downs i guess üòû	0

reasons to not join the 27 clubit's my 27th birthday tomorrow and a few people have joked to me about not joining the 27 club. if only they knew that i have contemplated being part of it in my low moments. and so i figured i'd write a list of my reasons not to join it in hopes of helping myself and others who struggle. your pain and trauma is not who you are. even in the most difficult of circumstances things can improve. the love that you have in your heart will be awakened again. your reason to go on should not be dictated by the amount of texts you received today. progress takes time. some of the best and the greatest humans in history accomplished things over the course of decades. whatever mark you want to leave on this world can happen. you are loved and cherished by your friends and family, even the ones that don't have the emotional capacity to tell you. you have the power to make a positive influence on someone or something. your ideas and art should see the light of day. even if your luck seems down or that everything is wrong, focus on your body, your health. if you have food in the fridge, internet, clothes, an education etc you are far better off than most people in the world. try to take that negative energy and focus it towards being grateful, towards your passions and towards your breath. go take a walk, write down a crazy story about you achieving your greatest dream of all time and how you felt. **** side note as i was writing the last line of that there was a knock on my bedroom door. i opened it up to find two of my best friends. they stood there with a box of brownies and came to surprise me. we proceeded by sitting on my balcony with some tea and they brought in my 27th birthday for me. i almost cried. and that my friends is literally the essence of what we live for, to reap every second we have to enjoy the company of other souls and make every second count ‚ù§Ô∏è sending all my love and virtual brownies to whoever needs it	1

how do i get over ex cheating ex? so me and my ex girlfriend first started talking in november of 2017. we meet online and seen each other in real life. so a couple months later she announced she was pregnant and said she was getting back with her baby daddy so we stopped talking. in june 18 2018, i got a phone call from her and she told me that she was upset because her baby daddy left her and her son. so we got back together after talking to each other for a few days and thing was working out and i even help with her son. but afterwards i notice shes been acting really suspicious and strange. she'll tell me things about how her co-worker was trying to flirt with her and was giving her hugs and ride home, i didn't make a big deal out of it. one day she started bringing up stuff about her ex (not her baby daddy) and was saying how there hitting her up and stuff. i told her to tell them that you're in a relationship or block them. she told me shes not going to block them or tell them shes with me and told me not to worry about it. so one day she told me that some guy ask her for heads and i ask her who was it? and where did it happen? she didn't tell me who it was or didn't even say if she gave him heads or not. so recently my auntie passed away and i been helping out with her son first birthday and buying things for them so we was on facetime and she brought up her ex again and sung a love song and said it was dedicated to him. we got into a bad argument, i asked her why is she always bring up stuff about her ex and guys? she just broke up with me and now shes not talking to me and she using the things i brought for her sons birthday without thanking me. she always accusing me of things like talking to other girls and stuff, she lies and fake out on promise, she makes me feel insecure about wearing glasses. i really don't understand whats going on? i really cared about her and her son. idk if its my fault or what? she texted me a couple days with a emoji and said üòï and texted me a minute later and said wrong person. i honestly miss her and don't know how to get over her	0

almost ruining a talent show this fu was both me and my friend. this happened over the summer at band camp. at the band camp there was a talent show. we were kinda messing around cuz if i'm being honest i was bored out of my mind. the acts were mediocre and i didn't know anyone up there except for one person. my friend wanted to record her singing cuz she was really good. my friend opens her camera and was planning to record. all of a sudden demi levato is being blasted out of her phone "this is real, this is me" let's just say we died right there. the mom in front of us was pissed and bitchy. we never figured out why or how it happened but we laughed our asses off. the rest of the talent show was the angry mom glaring at us and making snide remarks. eventually she says to us "really? can't you just be quiet?" we weren't even talking and i was sitting there thinking bitch wtf. at the end she said "thank you ladies" that pissed me off üòÇ tldr:blasted demi levato during a talent show performance.	0
i dream of killing myself. i mean i used to dream about getting married, having a job, experiencing stuff in life, normal shit. now i just spend a lot of time thinking about how no matter what i do or what happens in life it's inevitable that i'm not going to be happy. it's the most hopeless feeling. i've failed in every area of life. every single area. and i have no idea how to move on. or why i should try. i'm a miserable asshole. and to anyone who might say that it'll get better or there's no way i'll always be a miserable failure, forget it. you don't know me. i fucking suck. i'm literally the biggest dumbass i've ever "met". i'm incredibly ugly, dumb, selfish, lazy, unmotivated, pathetic person. i've been in tons of therapy, i've graduated college, i've switched careers a couple times. fuck that shit. it's never getting better. worst part is i'm too much of a pathetic dickbag to even kill myself. i just cut like a stupid attention whore and picture being able to actually just end it. maybe eventually. ü§ûü§ûü§û	1

embarrassing story time about two years ago i tried giving my bf at the time head. yeah so i had never done anything like this in my life and i didn't want to. well we eventually got alone and he decides to try forcing the next move. me, being a little bean, just started shaking uncontrollably. i started having an anxiety and eventually i passed out. my ex had to carry me out of the bathroom and i was out for a good 10 minutes. not funny at the time but now whenever i make jokes around my friends about giving head they start shaking and then act like they passed out. lowkey is pretty funny now. also how shit is it that every time i spawn in minecraft it's always in a freaking forrest. hope you have a good day btw. ciao cutiesü¶à	0

i'm a girl and i just killed a hugeass millipede and i'm pretty proud of myself. uhh you know how there's that stereotype that girls are afraid of insects and scream like crazy when they see them? well, it's real. those are my two sisters. meanwhile, i'm just different. i'm scared of insects too but i hate their unwelcome presence more so i have to kill them. i was lazing around in bed when the hugeass millipede appeared in the living room. since i'm the only one who dares to kill insects, my younger sister knocked on my door frantically, asking me to save them. lol. i sighed, put down my phone, grabbed my meat free monday cookbook (which i had yet to unwrap, ha!) and went out to kill the millipede. my elder sister's screams got super high pitched, fucking annoying and she was crying. ugh overreacting like usual üôÑüôÑüôÑ my younger sister yelled when i threw the book down onto the millipede. rip, millipede! right now, i'm back in the safety and comfort of my own bed. i left my book on the ground because i don't want to dispose the dead millipede. it's really disgusting. it's times like this i wish i had a dedicated boyfriend to clean this up. haha. 2019 will be the year i find a boyfriend üòÇüòÇüòÇ oh and it felt like a great ego boost to be needed and the person who actually did something instead of screaming and crying helplessly. i feel like such a badass. what a great way to end the night (although it would've been so much better without the annoying high pitched screams, thank you very much!). thanks for reading and have a nice day :)	0

i sucked my own penis üòé it has been 4 hours since i successfully sucked my own penis. things are different now. as soon as mouth-to- penis contact was made i felt a shockwave through my body. i have reason to believe i have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact i noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. i fear for my safety, i'm not sure what sort of power i may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. if i don't update this again please send help. update: just escaped from the pentagon, the government is sending all their military forces to pursue me, my life is currently in extreme peril. they attempted to strip my ability to suck my own penis but i created a shockwave to blast away the researchers before they could touch me. this is bad, i have exhausted all my chromosomes and now i have to hide and replenish my energy while the patrol helicopters fly over me.	0
eating honey mustard sauce with my hamburger. this, actually, is just happening. i'm at my girlfriend's house, she's got the flu and has fever and all. i ate a hamburger from a place close to home and might have added too much honey mustard. anyway, as a result i have the most horribly painful diarrhea i have had in the last 6 months. i cannot explain with enough words how my anus feels right now. so i took a gloriously smelly and painful dump before going out with her parents to go see the apartment they'll move to next week. they're actually very happy about it and i am too, it's a beautiful and big apartment and the rent is very nice. anyway, coming back from the apartment my girlfriend wanted to buy food and then decided against it because i had such a huge urge to give birth to a bottle of shit-filled anal water. and then she said "i have fever" to her mother and... well, we went to the drugstore to get her something. and it was such an embarrasing experience because my face was just changing shapes while waiting for her to pay for the meds... and here i am, shitting on her toilet. what a gloriously painful shit. will update. update1: she's literally reading tifu from my account on the computer now and there's no soap. update2: my anus feels like it's being barbecued with a flamethrower. update3: apparently what i washed my hands with was female intimate shower gel. update4: the smell is still there üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠this is so embarrasing.	0
weightlifting; why do people do it? not sure if this belongs here, sorry if it doesn't. tried it on r/fitness but it was removed. why do people take on the hobby of weight lifting? i started weightlifting a few days ago and i just realized how (i'm gonna get hate but here it goes üòê) unhealthily in a way it is. every weightlifting supplement out there is full of artificial sweeteners, there's bulking up which people often get carbs from everywhere possible (fast food) then "cutting " etc i've always wanted to have this hobby but now i'm not even sure anymore if it means not being healthy.. back when i was in 7-8th i was really obese then i started losing it by sophomore and started doing track/cross country and i started doing all of this because my family has a strong diabetes history which i wanted to avoid which is why i completely took all sugar out of my diet and all the unhealthy food out along with it.. weightlifters of r/fitness why do you have this hobby?	0
my best friend hanged herself 2 years ago and i only came to know about it yesterday üò≠ü•∫üíúüò≠i had just moved from australia to india because i was very mentally unstable. the minute i moved to india, i was admitted to the psych ward because i could never be left alone for even one second because i was so bent upon harming and killing myself. i hated myself and i was so depressed, i had crazy hallucinations and delusions that everyone was plotting a murder to murder me in a gruesome way so, i just wanted to kill myself before anyone else could. when i was admitted in the ward, there i met her. she was draped in purple from head to toe. she came with her mother who always seemed to be smiling. we introduced ourselves very quickly because we were of the same age. very soon, we developed a very very close bond. we were there with each continously day and night until the nurse had to physically drag her out of my room. we connected so well from the start because we suffered from very similar issues. both of us had depression and ocd. i could freely talk to her about suicide in a way that i could with no one else and she would know exactly what to say because she had been through the pain. both of used to obsess about the idea of death and we had very similar thought processes which always made us question about why we hadn't met each other earlier. however we were both very happy to have met atleast then and honestly i felt like i had known her for years. she was so talented. she was a very active blogger. she used to write dark stories about death and would drop a new blog every week. she had so much potential and she was original. she was obsessed with the color purple. she wouldn't dare to wear any other color which wasnt atleast a shade of purple. she was a very outgoing gal and even though she understood suicide deeply, she was still very optimistic and would love making friends in the ward. however she wasnt diagnosed, and i had never realized this but she would copy or do or say some of the same things that i or the other patients would do and tbh i didnt rly think much of it. the doctors knowing this, asked her if she was faking it because she was friends with me. they were asking her why she was doing and saying the same things as me. i remember her being very upset by this and tbh i dont think she was copying or saying the same things as me but whatever. so after 5 months of torture obviously but a lot less torture because of her, she honestly made my life heaven. idk what i would have done there without her. so they discharged me. when they discharged me, we were both rly sad coz she was gonna be there and i was going home. she showered me with gifts such a necklaces, books, purple tea etc... it was a sad goodbye however i was happy that i was getting out. after 2 days of reality, i couldn't do it anymore. i became suicidal as usual. and little did ik that in my room there was an open window. i lived in the 5th floor of an apartment and i remember climbing out of the window and sitting there. i was so ready to jump because i knew i was never gonna get another perfect chance like this. i tried not to over think too much because i really wanted to kill myself and i wanted nothing to interrupt me,not even a thought. the height was also huge so i knew i would die in a painful way. while jumping, i tried aiming for my head. however when i jumped i landed on my foot. i felt a shock so painful travel through my body. it was chaos. everyone was freaking out. i slowly felt myself passing out. everyone was terrorized. anyway i was put in an ambulance. i dont wanna talk too much about this but i broke every single bone in my body but my foot, spinal cord, one of my ribs, tail bone broke in a very very serious way. so i obviously went through days and days of complicated surgery and pain. they were sure that i wouldn't walk. so after a while i was moved to the psych ward again. i again met her and i was in so much pain i couldn't even cry or smile. and she was just a little mad that i would do this but she was so happy to see me. again she helped me through all of it. she was there like my mom. she was even there to help me move my fucking body when i was in so much pain just to take a shit in the bed pan everytime. she used to read books to me. she made playlists for me to listen to. she always always always made sure that i was occupied and made sure to distract me from the physical pain. i remember as i was recovering, she was the one who would push my wheel chair to take a walk and we would gossip, talk about boys, celebs , talk about dumb meaningless shit etc... and to everyone's surprise after 6 months i was able to walk 2 steps with a walker though painful i was atleast able to stand so everyone was happy about the progress. after a while, i was able to walk a little with the walker and they discharged me so i could go home. in this mean time, my friend and her mom left the hospital as they felt like she hadn't made any progress and she was angry with the doctors questioning about her faking it. so they decided to move to another state and we promised to keep contact. we kept in touch for a while and had a lot of fun as per usual. her mom also kept updating my mom. after a while everything suddenly stopped. i stopped recieving anything from her and at this time i was going through other personal and painful shit so i had relapsed badly again and i had forgotten about everything. after a year i tried reaching out to her in every way possible. i kept texting her like a fool till last week. i thought she had just abandoned social media or i thought that started to dislike me. i wasnt sure what to think of it and my mom kept pressuring me to forget about her so for a while i just let it slide even tho i was upset and confused. anyway yesterday midnight i got a message from some random guy who knew both of us, saying that she hanged herself. this guy refused to tell me his name. and he told me that she died a long back but nobody told u coz u were already suicidal and we didnt want it affect u. so just to make sure, i reached out to one of her neighbors as well as a close friend to make sure if she actually killed herself. turns out she hanged herself 2 years ago. i was in a state of shock and i still am. i'm not angry that she chose to take her life. i'm happy that she is in a much better place coz this world is not meant for everyone. i was upset and i'm still upset because i didnt know sooner. i'm upset that i have only come to know now because i had been trying to reach out to her like every 2 days like an idiot for a like 2 years. i'm upset that i couldn't help her in the same way she helped me. i wish i could have told her how much she meant to me and how much she changed my life before she left this awful place. she had so much potential. i wish i died instead of her. i don't have any purpose on this planet and neither do i have any talent. i just waste oxygen and take up fuckimg space. she could have offered so much and she already had so much to offer to this world. i'm jealous of how lucky she was to die in her first attempt. it's hard to die when ur killing yourself but i'm also happy for her at the same time. i just wish i could meet her soon some day and tell her how much she helped me and how much she meant to me. i didnt expect this. i am heart broken not because she left but because i didnt die and meet her there soon enough. i feel numb. i dont know what to do or say. i'm upset that i came to know about it so late. i just wish that u are happy wherever u are and i love u so fucking much. rest in peace b.	1

my (18f) boyfriend (19m) is pretending to not get certain texts so he doesn't have to reply to them hey all. i asked my boyfriend if he wanted to hang out tomorrow and he's pretending to not get the two total texts i sent asking about it, yet he gets the other ones. here's the convo we had- me: bubbbb him: yes beautiful? me: do you wanna do something tomorrow? him: babe? me: did you get my text? him: no i just got (old text) and "bubbb" me: i said do you wanna do something tomorrow? him: hun? me: you're lying (i thought it was a joke at this point) him: no i haven't gotten anything me: nevermind it's all good him: üòüok i know he got my texts. why would he not get two texts that were about spending time together but he got my other texts? also, if i ever say nevermind he usually begs me to tell him what i was going to say. nothing happened today, we've been absolutely fine and this is coming from no where. i don't know if i should leave him alone (he doesn't seem to be upset or angry with anything) or if i should call him out. if he doesn't wanna hang out i get it. i wouldn't be hurt. advice?? tl;dr - boyfriend is pretending to not see texts about hanging out yet he can reply to other texts.	0

i need help for a friend who's boyfriend killed himself i don't know where the best place to post this is. however, a month ago and 2 days ago, my friends boyfriend killed himself. they were living in mexico at the time. she is pregnant and had to come back to the united states for the doctors. as she was in the united states, she got the call from her boyfriend's mother. she said that her boyfriend was always so happy to see her and be with her. she wants to blame herself about it. i know it's nothing wrong that she did. i'm not sure what going through his mind. i'm just wanting to know how to help. she will say things like "üò≠üò≠üò≠ i hate my life. what did i do to deserve this kind of fate in life. i just wanna give up so bad. i just want my happiness back. i don't even know what to do or think anymore." i message her and just ask her how things are going. i'm trying to be a good friend and help her in ways that i can. she is trying to get a job and keep distracted from the fact. she is still keeping the baby and hoping that the baby will help her. the baby is due in may. she doesn't have much money to see a therapist and would rather see a support group. what can i look for and send to her that might help? any inspirational posts/websites or blogs that i could send to her to help?	1

my best friend died today.she died instantly in a freak accident with an eighteen wheeler and slippery roads. they say it was painless for her, but for everyone else it's painful. it's the first time i'm dealing with the death of someone so close to me. she was the person you could talk to for hours about anything, and tell her anything without her judging. she was only 17. she was such a beautiful person, and i'm relapsing into depression and suicidal thoughts. i'm trying my hardest not to commit, but i'm starting to make plans and cut deeper and deeper. i loved her so much, and she was ripped out of everyone's lives too soon. i'll always love you savannah ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

is he (m27) still interested in me (f23)? *super lengthy post so click off if you don't want to read it rather than complaining about how long it is in the comments, but i really need advice and opinions badly! please read the whole thing* i met a man several months ago on a dating app. he was kind, and sweet. we spoke for a month before we met up (i was really busy with exams and work). i wasn't expecting him to wait that long but he did. we texted and snapchatted a ton but didn't speak on the phone cuz he didn't like phone calls...which was fine. both of us were looking for something casual and a no strings attached situation after coming out of serious relationships. i told him i didn't want to drop my pants for someone the first time i meet them so i won't be having sex the first time, he was completely fine with that. when we finally met up we had such a great time! we got along great and made out tons. he didn't want the date to end so i did go back to his place but we just rolled around in bed basically dry humping and making out. he's a guy that's slept with a lot of women. i could tell he knows how to please a woman too. again, we both wanted a very casual nsa thing. before we met but spoke a lot he told me he was falling for me (ummm...), that he'd be my date to a fam wedding of mine, that i should go to his cottage over the summer with him and his friends etc. also during the date when i went to his house i met his friends and he gave me a tour of his whole house he was proud of building. he was talking about his godson and how one day i'll meet him too. after the date we still spoke but not to the extent we use to. we'd still talk every day though (he'd mostly initiate it). i was busy again whenever he wanted to meet up and this time he wanted to meet for sex and hanging out which was understandable (i know i was being shitty here by being too busy but i did have a lot going on and it was a very tough time in my life...). plus i felt fuck buddies didn't need to meet all the time. about 2 weeks after our first date... i asked if he was down for drink that following friday or thursday night. he said he was busy with school (i knew that was a lie cuz he only has school mon-wed) but he'd let me know. he replied to my text to hang out 4 days after i sent it and he was active on social media during that time. i replied saying if you're not interested anymore that's totally fine and to let me know rather than leave me hanging... i also wished him well with school. i didn't want to end in a negative way cuz i hate that. anyways he never replied to that text so i was like okay on to the next then! he did keep watching my snapchat stories though. a month later he contacted me by sending me a shirtless mirror selfie üòÇ i couldn't help but laugh and was caught off guard. i was seeing someone else at the time casually but immaturely and rudely wanted to keep him on the hook like he basically kept me on the hook. he's very attractive and i can tell he'd be a good lay. for a good 10ish days we were back to snapping every day but i was a lot colder. i kept saying i was busy and that i'd let him know when i'm free and then he said okay let me know. i said will do and he stopped contacting again. he also stopped watching my snap stories which was unusual behaviour from him. 3-4 months later i created an instagram. somehow he was one on the first 30 people to follow me (i guess i came up in is suggested contacts or something). he likes almost all my pictures and watches my instagram stories. i know he's seeing women and doing this with them too since it's clearly evident. wtf is up with this dude? i posted a picture to my instagram story of a baked item i made and he replied to my story with the fire emoticon. i said "wow long time! thank u" and he replied "i know. been busy:(". i said same and he never replied. then a couple days later i posted a lot of pictures and videos on my story from a drunk girls night out. the last picture was my best friend and i asking "if anyone wants to go on a road trip with us let us know... we cute and we don't bite... too much ;) serious inquires only!". he replied and said let's do it! we talked for a little bit and he suggested a place to go... but the conversation quickly fizzled. lastly, he asked a while back when he can see me again and called me babe. i said not right now cuz i'm in a sticky situation but soon (i'm down for a fuck tbh).... he said no worries and he hopes everything is ok... then said let me know when you want to go on an adventure with me. i said "what kind of adventure?" and he said "outdoors! beach, cottage, camping etc." he is talking a lot more dry then he usually does and takes at least 10 hours to respond to a text.... but this is an interesting fuck bud....he said his friend has a cottage if i'm down to go! anyways that convo fizzled out too. he posted a cute picture of his dog to his story to which i replied "omg he's adorable üòç". he said "feel free to come visit he doesn't bite" and i said "will do when i have time! we have to go on that adventure later in july btw".... he never replied to that. a day later he asked me if i wanted to go to the beach that weekend with him. i said i was working till late but i'm going to my friends cottage later that weekend and will see if he can come too if it's a huge party. he was down... but my friend declined extra people so i told him he wasn't allowed and i was sorry. also to tease a bit but i was full on serious as well i was like "aaahhh damn! i was hoping this could work out cuz one of my friends and i are both bi and we all would have had a lit time! another time for sure!" he said "no worries! have fun. we will have fun in the sun when you come back. you can bring your friend too if you want". to which i said "she's more gay than straight but i'll see if she's down ;) lmao sorry for assuming things! i'm assuming you contacted me again for something casual?? if not that's totally fine too just trying to figure out where your mind is at!" now this is what i don't understand... his reply to that... help me figure it out please. *"it's cool not sure what i'm looking for. kinda want to see what happens. have a great weekend cutie"* **whatever that is suppose to mean** anyways later on he'd casually respond to some of my snapchat stories with saying "sexy" "üëå" "üî•" and even asked "whose house is that" when i was at a friends 7.8 million dollar lake house. about a week later.... i asked "so are we ever going on that adventure or...?" to which he responded "sorry been busy. i'm going to _______ the last weekend of august if you're interested" i said "sure i'm down if work permits it! i don't want to intrude on your plans :$ i'll probably bring a friend or two, how many of you are going? but i really want to do something next weekend work is consuming my life" he said "lol that's fine. not sure my friend is planning it. if your free let's hit a trail or grab a drink. i'm free. join the club all i do is work" then... i was like "i'm down! free sometime next week for drinks? what does your work schedule look like?" he didn't open the message for two days (it's on instagram).... but hes been active and then he opened it but never replied. a week after he ghosted he wasn't watching my stories either. then the weekend we were suppose to chill he started watching everything religiously again from that point on. about a month later he replied to my story asking me where i worked, saying "damn üî•" to attractive selfies but not progressing more for a couple months. he also realized i was having a party and asked when it was. i told him the date but he did nothing else to further inquire. i posted many stories suggesting i'm seeing others and he has watched all of those. now a month after my party and him religiously watching all my stories he saw a video of me rock climbing. he challenged me to rock climb with him at my schools gym?! he said "when you're ready i'll take you on ;)" and i said "maybe sometime soon! don't think you'll be ready though" he said "woah challenge accepted" a couple weeks later i posted a pretty modest nude to my instagram story and he said "damn! i wanna see more of you in the new year" i said "lmaaoo! we've been flaking on each other for over a year i think üòÇ haha!!! but yeah let's set dates i'm game üòâ happy new years eve! x!" then he responded **"i know just waiting for the right time i guess üòÇ happy new year cutie. keep up the üî•in 2019üòç". later he posted a video of him and this girl at a new year's eve party to his story. this girl isn't his gf but someone he is seeing and has been on his story before briefly. he has another girl he sees often too. these two main girls are good friends of his and they also know his friends (he knows theirs as well). but none are girlfriends. **why is he still interested?!** what does he think i think of him?! lol is he even interested?! **tl;dr:** sorry for the wall of text but it's hard to summarize that^ so if you have time and are bored please read! what the does this guy mean? has this happened to you? and men that do similar things, why do you behave this way? no judgement just curious!	0

using a glory hole for balance. (reposting, as my prior one apparently wasn't considered me fucking up so they removed it ü§®) few weekends ago my boyfriend and i decide to go to a local bathhouse to fool around and maybe fool around with someone else. was our first time, we were fairly nervous. after touring the inside, we would occasionally stop and fool around with one another, before continuing to explore the building. at some point, we wind up in a stall which is roughly the size of a bathroom stall, sans bathroom. on either side of the walls are long rectangular holes, around mid thigh high. boyfriend and i are entwined with one another, going at it, and for balance, i absentmindedly stick my foot into one of the holes, propping myself up. yeah, my mistake. at some point, someone starts sucking on my toes from the other side. i know it was that, due to them occasionally softly nibbling them as well. at first, it was a little off-putting, but i was getting closer to orgasm with my boyfriend, so i went with it. suddenly, the mouth stops, a moment of nothing, and then warmth. i feel some slight hair, and then the top half of my foot is engulfed. several thrusts go by before i finally realize that my the literal top of half of my foot is in someones ass. i literally had my foot inside another persons ass. the entire top half of my foot. *within seconds* i promptly withdrew my foot, struggling to see if my assaulted foot now resembled a fudge brownie, and burst into emotional breakdown hysterical laughter of disbelief. then rushed to the showers. tl;dr. went to a bathhouse and my foot ended up in someone's ass.	0

so, what would you count as an attempt?i'm not going to go into details in this post because even though i want to kill myself i don't want anyone else to so i'm not giving ideas but what would you count as an attempt? like, did i try to ü•∏ half an hour ago or did that count as self harm. there are no physical marks on my body. i was mostly just experimenting. i mean my "experiment" is still in this same room but now i'm in bed so i don't see myself getting up again. that's past the point. what counts? like i feel like if i shared what i did with a doctor they would send me off. like they probably definitely would. whatever. geez my head hurts from my brain battling me. full on conversations with myself. i'm surprised no one overheard.	1
tifu by trying to tip the mickey d's drive thru workers... literally happened within the last hour. for the first time in my life i had no where to be on thanksgiving. i thought i could order a pizza or something, turns out every pizza place was closed (right on, glad they get to spend time with their families. ) at this point i just figure i'll hit mcdonalds and grab something. it's thanksgiving, so i feel bad, i'm gonna throw each of the drive thru workers a little $10 dollar tip. my order comes to $9.xx, so i ask if can pay with a $100 bill so i have some change to give them their tips. no problem she says. i get handed back 4 bills and the change. i didn't even pay attention. i hand this girl a $10 piece, get to the next window and hand homie a $10 piece. i get home and pull the change out of my pocket and all i have is two $20 bills left. (10+10+20+20=60üòû) not only did i tip the girl $10, she gave me a $20 bill back instead of a $50, so i'm out the other $30. i know i'm an idiot for not checking this, but i just figured this is something i shouldn't have to worry about... to top this all off, they forget my fucking mcchicken. unforgivable. i don't think she did it maliciously, but it's still annoying none the less, not to mention adding insult to injury with the missing mcchicken. my lpt folks is always check your change and your bag of food! oh, and don't eat mcdonald's on thanksgiving of course. tldr: tried being generous and tipping mcdonald's employees for having to work on thanksgiving, got short changed $30 and a chicken sandwich went m.i.a.	0

original gift ideas for long-lost sister needed so, my sister (21) and i (27) have never met and we're going to be meeting in london next month for the first time and i want to buy her a thoughtful gift. i thought a photo album filled with photos of me growing up would be a good idea, but i don't actually have that many photos of me as a child, therefore i would prefer to think of something else. i want to get her something thoughtful that she can keep forever, does anyone have any ideas? üòò	0
overcame my anxiety about driving today positive moment üòÅ i turned 24 recently, and up until a year ago, i hadn't had a license. never wanted one due to worries about being on the road. even after getting a license, and buying a car, i just couldn't bring myself to ride around, so my mother continued taking me to work. but my mother is in the hospital and i was so close to calling in sick today. my sister reminded me about all the insecurities within me about people looking down on a 24-year-old who can't drive (which is why i got my license). so in a way, one anxiety helped me overcome another anxiety. but my gosh, i haven't felt this alive, this useless, this human in all of my life. while the anxiety i have about driving is still there, it's nice to know that i can actually do it.	0
smelling my friends gf's vagina so like most, this happened a couple weeks back. i had a few friends over to swim, and beforehand, a couple of the girls used my bathroom to change/etc. a few hours later, everyone is getting ready to leave. i hop in the shower real quick to wash off, and since i'm already in there, i decide to shave my face. now, i have to note that i use those women's schick hydro razors. while they are technically a women's razor, they are usually cheaper than mens razors, and you can get a shitload of them at costco for pretty cheap. so i shave, hop out, dry off and notice i missed a few hairs on my upper lip. i grab the razor i have on the counter, and as soon as i touch it to my face, i notice a horrible smell. it smelt sort of like bad fish, almost how i would imagine the dumpster at a joe's crab shack would smell. being the only person that regularly uses this bathroom, i assume the smell is linked to stale water left on the razor or something, and i ignore it. shortly after, my friend's girlfriend comes in the bathroom, and says "i hope you didn't just shave with that razor, your mom gave it to me so i could shave my bikini area!" it took me a few seconds to process what she said, and for some reason, i denied using it. as soon as she left the bathroom though, i scrubbed the shit out of my face for a good five minutes with the hottest water possible. i still haven't told my friend about it. i don't know what is worse: that i know what my friend's girlfriend's vag smells like, or that i'm aware of her poor womanly hygiene. tl;dr: the new schick hydro¬ÆÔ∏è 5, now with bacterial vaginosis!	0
being racist towards black cats obligatory this didn't happen today, just got around to writing it. okay so some context: me and my parents found a starving black cat on the 19th while out for a walk. we've found many cats before, none have come close to the pitiful shape this one is in. i'm talking concentration camp skinny. when i reached down to touch her i burst into tears because it was so painful. so... it's been a very intensely stressful couple of days, worrying about this sweet kitty and having to keep her contained since we have 6 other cats and we can't risk her spreading disease if she has one. she starts throwing up what she's eaten, and i panic. she's already so weak she's only walked a few feet at this point and it's been two days. so i'm shaking and freaking out and we go to the emergency vets (we found her when every place is closed aside from there and it's very expensive so we tried to hold off talking her.) we get there and my head's a buzz, i'm socially awkward enough but i'm already attached to this cat and trying not to burst into tears so people are talking to me and i'm just.. delayed and not really thinking about what i say or do. the vet can tell i'm visibly upset so she tries to make small talk and distract me. we're talking about our other pets and how we already have two other black cats. i mention she looks just like one of them and was found on the same street so she might be related. but instead of ending there, i kept talking. "now i'm not one of those people who say all black cats look alike because they don't but-" and i realized what i said to the african american vet. and i die inside. i feel like a crushed soda can internally. she knew, i knew. cringe. long story short, my dad made sure to roast me endlessly for that slip up and the kitty is okay right now. she's currently eating and purring on my lap happy as can be. i'm not sure i'll make as a speedy a recovery as her though.üôÑ tl;dr found a starving cat, took her to the vet and had a tobias funke-esque slip up where i ranted about how i think all black cats don't usually look alike to a black vet without realizing what i was saying.	0

accidentally nutting on my own face throwaway because a few of my friends and family know my actual username, and this was mortifying. i don't need anyone i know in real life ever knowing about this. i'm still in shock about it 2 days later and i'm just trying to laugh it off at this point but this fuck up takes place 2 days ago (saturday night). it had been a while since i last had sex, went through quite a lengthy dry period (roughly 8 months) so obviously i was pretty excited. overall the sex was great, brought her back home after a night out, we smoked a little weed and then started going at it. i notice i'm more sensitive than i have ever felt before, i associate this with the fact that i had not had sex in a long time, and possibly the weed, i can't say for sure though because before this i had never had sex whilst stoned before. this was a bit annoying, but nothing a little pacing and edging can't solve (this plays a role later on in the story). after about 10 minutes in bed, we decide to move to the bathroom (yes very classy, i know) just in case, because i had a few friends sleeping outside and i didn't want to risk them walking in on us, and locking the room door was just sketchy. without going over the details, we're in the bathroom for 15 minutes, and i feel myself about to ejaculate but despite my best efforts at pacing and edging, i hit the point of no return. i was sitting on a basket when this happened, and i pulled out quite literally 0.5 seconds before i came, and i managed to give myself a facial. i was so shocked that for about 3 seconds i did nothing. i was so shocked and needed a sec to briefly reflect on how i just managed to finish on my own face. she burst into laughter as i began to collect my thoughts and wiped my face off. in the end, it actually didn't change her feelings towards me, moreso solidified this image of me being a meme to her in her mind. i came out of it with mass feelings of disgust (as a guy the last thing you want on your face is semen), embarrassment, shame, and any other synonyms that are relevant ü§ï tldr: had sex for the first time in a while, finished on my own face by accident, she laughed it off, i'm here trying to console myself on reddit by typing it up	0

what does it mean if the girl who i [m/16] like [f/16-17] said this? so for some backstory, long story short, i use to like and talk with this girl a lot throughout middle school but then once we reached high school, we stopped talking (mostly because of me since i stopped talking to her). lately, i've been talking to her again after 2 years and begin developing feelings for her again. anyway, yesterday, she asked me about if prom was still a thing going on for our school (long story for a different conversation) and when i asked her why she asked, she said that a couple of months ago,!a guy asked her out but she said that it's too early for prom but if he can't find someone to go to prom with, then she'll go with him. this was how it basically went: me: "ohh üòèüòèüòè" her: "lmao don't..." her: "it ain't like that" what does this mean? i mean i'm not gonna lie, i was kinda jealous but i don't really care. i like her and everything, but life's life and it is what it is. i'll still like support her and everything and hey, if she likes someone else, then i hope she gets whoever she likes :) she's also said sent me [this](<url>) last week though (yes, she wrote that 2 years ago but only recently showed me since she thought that she'd never show it to me again until recently). some people say that it's basically friendzone material while others say that she likes me. she's also been pretty active in texting me and stuff. also, i confessed to her recently and she didn't seem to take it negatively. in fact, she was a bit more active in texting me. so, what does this all mean? am i overthinking this? what's going on? tl;dr: girl who i like gives off odd signals. help. sos.	0

suicidal thoughtsso, my mom caught me trying to sneak a large amount of alcohol up to my room last night; which is definitely not allowed and against the safety plan. i had planned on drinking until i blacked out so i wouldn't have to think or feel. i just want the suicidal thoughts to stop and that was the only way i could think of to achieve that. i dk. i guess at this point i'll try to make it through the weekend without acting on any of my suicidal impulses. but i'm just tired of trying to fight it. it would be easier to just give up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	1
overdosedi od'd about two weeks ago and my sister found me in my room. i was resuscitated unfortunately. you would think the trauma i put on my sister and family would be enough to make me rethink suicide but it's not. i need to finish the job this time it's pointless. life is fucking pointless. i've been raped, sexually assaulted, bullied, dropped out of college. i tried to find joy in the small things, tried to enjoy just waking up everyday. but it's a chore. my mind is working fucking overtime bombarding me with all these thoughts and anxiety. it's never ending and i need it to be quiet please let my world be quiet. please let my attempt work. i just need for this to be over. i'm sorry for ranting, i just had to tell someone so why not some internet strangers. good bye and thanks for listening ‚ù§Ô∏è	1

yeah i think i'm gonna attempt tonight. this will be my worst (hopefully) attempt yet.i'm gonna try to od, did some research and certain... pills... take surprisingly less to kill yourself with, accidentally or on purpose, than i thought they would. i guess this is the one time i'm happy i'm small and skinny, less weight the more i can get fucked up with an od. i've written so many suicide notes idk if i have brain capacity or shits to give to sit through another one anymore. wish i had a way to let my friends know about my death, _after_ i'm dead but i dunno how to achieve that. perhaps i'll brainstorm and leave a little note that my last wish is for someone to notify and thank all of my friends. peace out (probably). ‚úåÔ∏è	1

suicide. fucking hair loss. i cant fucking get my head round it. im 15. and i got extreme fucking hair loss. like, so many strands fall out on a daily basis(usually by itself). i don't pull, overstyle or touch it yet so mucj falls out. i see so many girls with amazing thick hair, and it just makes me wanna fucking die. i almost get angry at them for having hair. washing my hair gives me extreme anxiety because i can feel loose strands on my back or see it floating around in the water. i used to have such thick, long hair and it ever fell out i never noticed because i had so much hair. but now i barely have a handful on each side and a bit at the back. so much scalp is on show and i have to fill it in with makeup or some shit. i hate looking at myself in the mirror because of how sad it makes me. its literally making me suicidal. i went to the hairdressers and even she said my hair is a lot thinner than before. she told me to stop stressing and eat more protein(which admittedly i havent), but on the days where im chill and do eat a lot of it my hair still kinda falls. i have battled anorexia recently and am eating more, but my stress is bad. is this the cause? i had my thyroidsloods checked and they said i was fine, but a couple of days back my bloods have apparently changed and my organs are slowly shutting down. well, this fucking scared me so i have been eating more, but my hair is falling out constantly still. please help. my mum says i cant get an appointment with the doctor till next week. and at the fucking rate im going, i wont have any fucking hair. i am trying to target stress, but then i think how my hair will never grow back and it'll keep happening, and that just makes me feel like absolute shit. and it aint like i have high selfesteem in the first place anyways. i know im probably overreating but this has been going on for so long. and i know this is going to sound crazy to some people and it aint going to sound like a big deal, but this really affects me. its driving me insane. and it isn't like i don't have other shit going on in my life(read my other threads). my hair was one of the most liked parts of me, people always used to compliment it and comment on how full it was. but now its slowly goingüòî.	1

spay paint is fun, but i feel like i gave myself cancer after using it. i only used like a few ounces of spray paint to mark my suitcase so it can be identified as mine when i go on vacation. the way i did it looked terrible, but damn i felt like i was in the nwo after using it. the fumes were so strong though that i got a minor headache, im not sure if it was because i was worried about the fumes or it was actually the fumes. now after reading about how harmful they can be even when minorly inhaled i feel terrible to my stomach. i thought it was okay to use for 10 minutes and now i feel like i gave myself cancer. someone please help me ü§Æ	0
i could smell the hypocritical stench oozing out of his pores. some guy came into the store i work at today and saw that we sell knives that were made in india/pakistan. he started running his mouth about how they were cheap and people should just buy american. i explained to him that it's difficult for us as a small business to make a living on selling strictly american made items like knives because the cost of buying the items wholesale and then retailing them creates a very large price point for the customer, who in most cases isn't interested in investing a ton of money into something like a pocket knife unless they're serious collectors (which most aren't). i told this gentleman that while our store does carry a large majority of items handcrafted right here in the state, we do also carry imports in order to give the customer a more affordable souvenir to take home. i told him that i always make an effort to distinguish the imports from the domestics, and how they would need to be willing to spend the extra cash for the real deal but ironically most people balk at the prices of stuff made locally and go for the cheap imported shit he rambled on about how my opinion is wrong and that i wouldn't think the way i do if my work was being outsourced, which was hilarious to me because right after he went on his rant he took a call from a friend on his iphone‚Ñ¢Ô∏è that was safely enclosed in its otterbox‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. i laughed at him and said "nice iphone" to which he responded "yeah, made in china... ...smartass"	0

long distance relationship(36f(38m)platonic friend (66m) went to visit stayed with him for a week. meet girl on app for language. she is asian, been talking for 3 months. things are very good. both happy and very easy to talk to. plan to meet. bought tickets mid january. meeting early march. she says she is going to europe to stay with a girlfriend she met on a mediterranean cruise last summer. she has been to europe in october too to stay with person. gut feeling to me was lie, gets back and i ask her about it. says yes it was with a guy but not a boyfriend. i say ok you just stayed in europe with a guy in his house for week and nothing happens. she replied with. " i had sex, but not a boyfriend. " thinks i hate her and trip canceled. she said that she thought that is what i wanted to hear from her that she had sex. the next day she says she spoke to mother and she said that she should not lie she tells me she did not want to worry me by saying she is going to meet a man. she says he is 65 (same age as her mom) and that he is just a friend that met on cruise ( also visited in october last year) she said there is nothing between them and that he is like a father. they went to museums and concert. she says she lied because she thought i would not believe her if she said that she is going to meet a guy without sex. but why would she even admit to having sex and say not her boyfriend? ü§î she says that she couldn't care less at that time and thought the relationship was over and that she couldn't visit me and thought i hated her. said there was no plans to do bad things or have sex. if there was why would she say she was going to europe? she could of just never told me? ü§î just weird to me that a person would say she had sex if they didn't? just because i thought they did.? but women are not logical.. she says that she thought i would not believe anything she said so she says she had sex because she thought i hated her because she did ignore txt for 5 days until she got to airport ü§îü§îü§£hmmm. i was asking her what her friends name was and where are the pix of them at? so obviously she ignored them because she didn't want to argue on vacation. but why,,, would anyone lie and admit that they had sex when they didn't? then say it is not her boyfriend. weird... we had already planned to meet 3 weeks before she bought tickets to europe. she had a commitment to come see me and honestly i don't want a woman that would put seeing me in jeopardy just for a week in europe. she is very conservative asian type or at least that's how she wants me to see her. talking with her after she seems like she is love with me. that is why this yes very confusing. gut feeling says they had sex, i know women will lie to avoid hurting your feelings but this is weird complicated story that breaks my trust. my gut thinks that yes she was there having sex with an old man ü§Æ is it possible to met an old man on cruise then became friends and travel to his country and stay at his house without anything happening? ü§î my gut says no. **tl;dr;** says it is just platonic friends with old man stayed at home for week and lied to me. i think they are having sex.	0

a year ago i survived. may fifth 2017 i sat in a crowd with my graduating class. we "celebrated" that the four short years we spent together would be ending soon. i listened to fellow class mates give speeches about their families and friends. looking at my classmates who packed the event with loved ones and sold out tables, i compared my own situation. i felt completely and entirely alone. i was about to graduate high school, i should have felt happy or relieved. i felt terrified and bleak about my future. i felt as if i had already thrown my life in the toilet. i felt like i was just a shell of a person, just hanging around. i had struggled with suicidal thoughts from as young as i remember. and that night, the years of "wussing out" and "failing" were enough. and this time i was going to do it. my mom found me in my room the next day and left me alone in the hospital. the hours that followed were the most painful and terrifying of my life. i felt myself dying. and instead of the peace i anticipated, i felt intense fear. the weeks that followed were some of the worst weeks of my life. the main reason why i felt inspired to write, is that i watched a buzzfeed video of someone who attempted suicide and survived. he talked about how thankful he was every single day that he lived. i'm sure that's the case for some people, but that was not the case for me. i felt even worse, i thought that surviving this attempt and almost dying would have given me a new perspective on life. it didn't, i had to find this perspective myself. there are still some days that i feel suicidal, but i remember how scared and how horrible it was. tl; dr: it has been over a year since i survived a suicide attempt. it is so hard. i just want everyone reading to know, whether you survived an attempt, or are considering suicide, life gets better. i know it seems bleak now, believe me. it. gets. better. i too, believed that i would feel horrible forever, i felt the same as you. please, reach out to someone you can trust. you deserve to stick around and be happy. i love you have a good night. please please be careful üíï	1

just thinking....ü§îü§îü§î boy is it long~sorry as another hour clicks by i've been really starting wonder when the suicide entered my life. the first time when i was old enough to understand was when my sister went to college and she was very depressed. she came home on winter break. she made a tape recording of herself, which i found in her car. i thought it was a music tape but it was her voice saying how she felt. how she wished she had the nerve to jump off of the roof that she found access to. how much of a failer she felt and how she said my mom and dad were making her feel like she wasn't trying hard enough. i was 7 when i heard those words. it broke my heart. she still today doesn't know i found that tape. from that moment on i worried terribly about her. do i go to mom and dad? what do i do? well at that age i did what every kid would do, not say anything to mom and dad but be with her every second i could. i made it my "mission" to be with her constantly. she made it through those difficult years. she is very happy now with 2 kids and a loving husband. but, here i am going through some pretty heavy shit now. my first suicide attempt was when i was 23. second one was about....7 years ago. and now here i am thinking, you know, it's just not worth it anymore. it's too much effort to even breath now. i ended a very abusive relationship, and it sucks having to go around living in this much pain day in and fucking day out. whats wrong with me? what in my head is broken. i'm not looking to blame anyone. but trying to grab the brass ring of hope, do i get suicidal because i was exposed to that world at such a young age? why does it hurt so bad? i remember asking for help when i was starting to become unstable and my mom said that i wasn't going to go to talk with someone cause it would look bad on her, what would the family think? and that i was silly for thinking the way i do. now she has past, and now i feel ashamed of myself, i have deep trust issues, and i don't know who to reach out to??? i have a psychiatrist, but i have such deep trust problems he probably wouldn't want to hear it anyway. well thanks all. anyone's insight will be greatly considered.	1

okay so he isn't my so and our relationship isn't romantic whatsoever, but i feel like this frienship is toxic, do i end it? okay so i have a friend (met through my ex) who i think lies to me all the time and i'm not sure if i'm being too harsh as i don't think i want to be friends with him anymore. at times i know things are definite lies for example, one tuesday he messaged saying he was trying to get his cat into a bag, and then the next day he messaged me saying his mum abuses his cat amd she's ran away and has been missimg for 3 days, so obviously he was lying about one of those things, he doesnt get along with his mum and always tries to paint her in a bad light because apparently she's a bitch, but i feel like he migjt lie about that too for attention, and even if she is a bitch, he doesnt help himself with the situation and makes himself vulnerable to her time after time by doing nice thimgs for her amd then complains when she doesnt appreciate it, which she never has done so i dunno why he keeps doing it, so i can't really sympathise with him about that. i feel like he lies for attention and sympathy, and when he comes to me with 'real' problems, i can never tell if he's telling the truth as i've noticed lots of his stories don't coincide so i can't bring myself to sympathise as a lot of the time i feel like it's a lie and i'd just be wasting my time, esp as when i try amd help him he changes the topic and complains about something else or says he doesnt wanna talk about it or he just ignores my response and basically repeats himself agaim showing that he doesnt want to be helped. another lie i think he's told is when i told him i had pcos a few months ago, and he told me the girl he's constantly on and off with has it too and misses a lot of periods too, but then not long ago he told me that that girl could possibly be pregnant with another guy's kid as she's missed a period, so i was like 'well tell her not to worry as missed periods are really common with people who have pcos and a lot of the time it's hard to get oregnant if you have it' and he just said 'what?' or something like that so i said 'you told me she had pcos a few months ago?' and he was like 'no i didnt, i domt know what that it is' or something like that üòë so there's a perfect example of him lying again and brushing stuff off when i sort of question him about stuff, it's so infuriating. he's also very passive aggressive with me when i don't pay him enough attention and when i don't open his messages he'll message on numerous platforms or spams me with messages until i reply, and if i've told him i don't to hang he'll say somethinf like 'can i pinch some baccy as ive ran out and i'm close by' and then he ends up staying for 3/4 hours. i feel like this is a really unhealthy relationship and unconventional way to act with a friend but i'm not sure if that's just me being cold hearted? another alarmimg thing is that he's lost so many friendships (alarming number) over time, and i know people lose friends with age but surely if it's that many, maybe he was the problem? he loves to complain about people using him etc and how people hurt him constantly, but he just sticks himself in those situations so again, i can't sympathise with him as i've also been there but i've learnt my lesson. one other thing that's really bothered me is that he's told me about his health and stuff and how he's constantly in and out of hospital and seeing doctors etc, but he won't tell me why and of course i worry as i'm human and he knows how to tug at my heart strings as he knows i'm very sympathetic and have a big heart (not bragging, i hate it, it's gotten me into shit situations), and because of the lack of info he gives me, i feel like he lies about it for attention, cause why bring it up if you don't want to talk about it? but then i guess sometimes you just don't wanna talk about things and it's understandable, but what made me think that he was lying about this was the fact that he seems to be able to see the doctor/get a hospital appointment straight away whenever he wants needs one, and not saying he's unimportant, but surely unless they are in critical condition, surely you wouldn't be able to get an appointment at the click of your fingers? but maybe that's just me being paranoid because he's lied about other stuff he also complains about how all the girls he dates (at the same time) are 'crazy bitches' and won't accept that he's probably been a dick to them and their actions are most probably justified as if he acts the way he does with me, with them, i'd be the exact same lol, but i dunno how to tell him this without being mean. i've never had to 'break up' with a friend as i've never come across someone who's acted like this with me before and i'm not sure whether i should give him a chance because he is nice to me most the time and is supportive at times, but that's stopped now as i've needed some time to myself and can't reply to him 24/7 and i just feel like i'm mentally drained after seeing/talking to him or do i just tell him i don't wanna be friends with him cause of x, y and z and see what his response is and go from there, or do i just act like nothing is wrong and let it fizzle out, and if i should break it off, how do i it? also, i'm not the only person who's noticed he's a bit odd and lies a lot, a few friends he's met through me have mentioned something to me without me saying anything first, which shows that i'm not just being paranoid tl;dr basically i've caught a friend out for lying before which makes me believe he lies about other stuff, and i dunno whether to end our friendship or do i just give him the benefit of the doubt	0
my [25m] first relationship that has lasted from my teens to well into my early adulthood just ended, where do i start? what app or way would be the best to meet new people? ideally i am looking for people who don't have much experience with different people either. we are out only ones ever (from first kiss and beyond) and we were together for so long. i am in my mid 20's and have a job, a car... i am also very nervous and a bit socially awkward and i think i already have a crush on someone based on their profile üòÖ (not saying it is wrong to have experience, it's just not my ideal) also, how do you people see relationships with exes? there is no ill will between us, she [23f] just decided to dumb me since it was not something she found "right" anymore. not feeling good about it, since we had a really really good relationship, but apparently it did not just work for her. we are still friends. tl;dr how do i begin dating after my first ever relationship, that has lasted my whole adult life?	0

how do i (17f) talk more with a boy? i started talking occasionally with a boy in my class about a month and a half before school ended and basically ended up with a big crush on him oof. the thing is, i'm going into my senior year but he's a year ahead and just graduated. i don't even know if he'd want a relationship the summer before college (his is like 4 hours away), but he's so fun to talk to that i'd be happy to even make friends with him. (skip this paragraph if you don't want rambling lmao) my ap chemistry teacher paired us together for a day and we started talking and making each other laugh. we've kind of known each other for a few years but just started talking then, but we got along really well and share interests like band and the same video games. we briefly talked about minecraft and zelda a few times after that, and during his final chem presentation he kept making eye contact with me even though i sit on the side of the room. after my presentation he stood up and air fived me from the other side of the room :') now that i've overanalyzed everything: i have a few mutual friends who have mentioned him in conversation a lot, and we once all hung out with my crush in a bigger group. should i try to hang out with them and play smash or nintendo land or something and ask them to invite him? would it be weird to add him on snapchat and start a conversation?? he's amazing and i just want to be huge video game nerds with him and uhhhh maybe hold hands please help fellow teenagers üò§	0

2 months left, what should i do? im pretty confident with my plan, the only thing i need is to wait a bit longer.there is still snow outside and i can't get to the train tracks bc of that. so, what should i do in the meantime? i thought about planting flowers and hanging out with friends. also will try to make a comics. btw don't suggest getting help, i already go to the therapist and take ad, i just can't handle my life anymore. school has been very hard for me, i constantly feel tired, my marks got worse, i lost all motivation to keep going. there are more reason but i don't feel like sharing. who knows, maybe in a couple of months i will feel better? thanks in advance!! üíñ	1

so i just had to call the police because someone nearly got knifed outside. anyone got any fun stories? this one: i'm just about to get into bed and i can hear voices outside. i see some bald dude with his shirt off walking around the street randomly just shouting to himself. i watch him for a bit and then get bored, but then hear more shouting. i look again and there's another shirtless dude chasing the first one with a knife. this is the point i call the police at. they run off out of sight, then come back. knife dude throws the knife at the other guy, they start having a fist fight, police come and 2 minutes later they're hugging. bizarre. anyway they took the knife dude away in a different police car. oh well, maybe next time don't run around throwing knives at people at 00:00 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è	0

this is either a fucked up love letter or a potential suicide note tldr; first half is mostly impulse rambling, but it's less suicidal by the end parts. unrequited love sucks. you know who you are. this thing in my head keeps growing, and i can't get rid of it. if i have to wait too much longer i know it'll kill me i can't wait it out i don't know how i swear i can't breathe please help you don't care. i wanna die i want to end me but i don't wanna die i need you here to tell me it's okay you've kept me breathing before it's why i feel so safe with you you don't care. i can't fix it you won't let me you're the only person alive that means something; my whole world you said it once. your world. you loved me once, and i want that again you were afraid we'd grow apart and then you just stopped i wanted to try i'm still desperately trying i want you to try it hurts it won't stop it won't stop and i just wanna love you with everything i have. you don't care. please don't throw me away. i want it to stop. but i understand how this feels now to want to die thinking of ways to do it shutting people out the apathy. drowning. i get it. and i want to keep trying to be better to be your whole world all over again i keep the ring, but i don't wear it. to think it means nothing at all after the promise you made. before you had to leave. you said it would be worth it. i believed that and i waited for you. i know it was hell but you made it out. 2 months later i was damn happy to hug you again, and cry into you like you were the only man standing. it was hell to let you go a second time. i still waited. and then you came back for good finally. then you started to push me away. i know you were struggling with other things. i remember the first time you came over to break things off. i didn't react well. i thought that was it. but you were brave to approach me directly. i was almost okay with letting you go, because you gave it to me straight. you needed time. so i stayed silent, even though i couldn't sleep. but you came back the next night to say that you fucked up and that you still loved me and i was so relieved that maybe i could help you through things, because i wanna support you however i can. but i'm shit at talking i don't know i wasn't enough so you cut me off anyways. you quit talking altogether. i panicked. i'm prone to that, and the only way i knew how to cope was to solve the problem. false hope tends to keep me above water, but only for so long. it just gets worse now, because the thought of you with anyone but me makes my stomach drop and my heart shatter into pieces and there's no way out i can't breathe anymore you don't care. do you love her already? it's easier to be jealous, i think. anger replacing emptiness. but this burning sensation in my head always comes back and wraps me up suffocating me in it. i'm obsessive dramatic crazy whatever i'm just crazy shit-bonkers for you in particular so i thought it would last, but i never wanted to put this much pressure on you. like shit i need more friends i just hate people and don't connect easily #introvertproblems so yeah, i still have a lot of growing up to do. you've shown me that at least, and that maybe i can be an adult for once. but still i'm not gonna be just that //crazy ex girlfriend// that never got over you. it's bullshit. as if at one point you didn't want to spend the rest of your life with me. you brought it up first and i was all onboard even if it wouldn't be for a while. and the night you brought up the big l word with me is still my favorite memory. right up there with you proposing. i know when i'd miss you the most i'd replay it in my head. i don't know how much it means for you but it means a lot to me. with that said, i'm aware i can't just change your feelings, but this way i can at least explain mine to the fullest extent that i can, without bombarding your phone with my bullshit and expecting an answer on the spot. not one of my brighter methods of communication, honestly... but that's what i got for now. --üëª	1

my final goodbyeit's come to my realization recently there is an almost zero chance that i will ever have the life that i've been trying to manifest for the last decade and i'm simply not okay with that. i'm no closer to success today than i was 20 years ago and i'm not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. it's become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. i am so tired of struggling. always having nothing. i've been in debt literally my entire adult life. even with two bankruptcies i can't seem to get my shit together. every time i try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. i will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what i do to try - i'm so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - it's been literally my entire fucking life. i don't remember a time that i wasn't in debt and i don't remember a time that i haven't been stressed about finances. it seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that i am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much i want it or how hard i try for it. about a year ago i had what i would call a spiritual awakening. a realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. i believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before we're born. the bonds we create on earth are actually created long before we're ever even conceived. we all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. i've had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which i have completely fucked up beyond what i can ever recover from. i've done stupid things, said stupid things and i've hurt people that i was supposed to walk this life with. it's unfortunate because i know i could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. i just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. time for a reset. please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me could've done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of "i should've or could've or would've" done something had i only known how bad he was. i'm so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews. i promise that no matter what i will always look out for all of you from the other side. i love you r ‚úåÔ∏è ps please do not have a funeral for me. i don't want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life. also, i wouldn't bother dealing with the cra or the bankruptcy. you'll only find insurmountably crushing debt that's pretty much un-erasable anyway... believe me i've tried. i'm so sorry if my passing has caused any financial strain to anybody. i have nothing to offer financially but maybe you can sell some of my belongings to cover any expenses that come up from this. again, i'm so sorry. i just can't live like this anymore.	1

using fix-a-flat well, this just happened.woke up this morning and noticed that the drivers side rear tire was flat on the mini-van. as i was on my way to work, i didn't have time to deal with it at the moment so hopped in the car and went into the office.busy day at the office, i called the wife and let her know i'd be home at lunch to get things taken care of. on my way home for lunch, i stopped at the local wal-mart to grab a can of fix-a-flat. for those that don't know, it's an aerosol can you can hook up to your tire, and inflate. it also contains a foam like compound that will temp seal/path any holes up to a 1/4" diameter according to the can. this cost about $9 after tax. i chose to go this route vs. using the spare to try and save time, as well as the van being parked on an incline. i didn't want to move it on the rim and risk further damage to the tire or the rim itself, so i figured "hey, let's give this a try and see how it works". so i get home, grab a bite to eat while going over the directions again to ensure i understand the procedure. once comfortable with the steps, i go outside, hook the can up to the tire and press the button. voila - tire is inflated enough to move and we're ready to take it to the shop for complete repair after finding the cause of the flat -- a large nail in the tread. i follow the wife to the tire shop about 2 miles away. talk to the guy at the front desk and let him know i needed a flat repair. he quoted the cost at about $20-30, which was expected. as he's typing my info into the computer, he asks if we had any other questions -- that's when i casually mention that i threw in a can of fix-a-flat to limp us to the shop.you could instantly see that there was a problem by the look on his face right before he says "ohhhh....unfortunately we can't repair it after that's been used. the goo inside is extremely hard to clean out and causes issues with plugs/patches." pretty much already knowing the answer i ask what options i have, and of course the answer is "replace the tire". he then follows that up with "they should really be putting a label on the can that let's people know this" -- and my response was "yeah, no shit". i call around to 4-5 other shops and get the same answer. turns out, no one is willing to touch a tire after this stuff has been used, so now my vehicle is sitting down at a tire shop waiting to get the whole thing replaced. in the end, i'm looking at $170 or so because of a nail, and my lack of research ahead of time. looking at the fix-a-flat faq on their website i see the following: frequently asked questions ## after using fix-a-flat¬ÆÔ∏è can my tire be repaired? yes, there is nothing in the formulation that would prevent a tire from being repaired. advise the tire repair professional that you have used fix-a-flat¬ÆÔ∏è brand tire inflator in your tire, so they may properly clean the tire for repair. fix-a-flat cleans up easily with soapy water and a shop rag. warranties vary by tire manufacturer. contact your tire manufacturer for specific details. so yeah, that is completely false. really wish i would have known this before making this costly mistake -- had i done some more google searching i probably would have found other people mentioning this, but i just didn't have time and needed to get the car back on the road..... so anyway, my mistake is your gain! don't use fix-a-flat unless it's an emergency and you have no other option!!!! tl;dr used a $9 can of fix-a-flat to temporarily repair a flat tire. learned that tire repair shops won't repair tires that have fix-a-flat in them, which resulted in replacing the whole tire, costing me $170\+ instead of the just $20-30 for a standard patch/repair.	0
jennifer egan's _goon squad_ and thuggin' on nostalgia i've recently read several reviews of this book which all criticized it for it's unusual form. complaints ranged from the trite ("don't call it a novel if it's really an anthology") to the prescriptive ("i wish we had followed a certain character longer"). personally, i didn't have a problem with the fact that this was all vignettes. i read it as performing the phenomenon of experience mediated by the passage of time. the way we think about our own lives is very rarely sequential, and i think egan's semi-arbitrary starting and stopping points were meant to reflect that. many of the stories don't even take place primarily in the present tense, instead foregrounding large tracts of text where the characters use whatever is immediately present in their lives as a sort of springboard for meandering examinations of the critical path that has brought them to that point (or, in one case of peculiar third-person omniscience, where their path will take them in the future). what struck me as much more of a cheat was the wistful, misty-eyed, nostalgia-tinted sentimentality of many of the chapters. not only is using nostalgia as an end run to make a piece of writing more heartfelt than it would otherwise be a bit *de rigeur*, it hides a sort of nefarious implication that life's meaning is to be found by looking backwards over our shoulders at what's already transpired even as we collectively and blindly stumble forward. but... is that really so? surely there's a sort of aura of heroism which surrounds people who can un-self-consciously embrace the present, or (god forbid) see the uncertain potentiality of the future as being fat and lush with possibility. but that's just me. if you ever catch me staring into space, all glassy-eyed, i'm probably day dreaming about my plans for the future. üòù what about you? which was your favourite squaddie to read about?	0
i got laid off today but am feeling super pumped about it i was working on commission and recently not making that much money so my boss was really doing me a favor. life's been happening, i've been living more spiritually, and my creative passion projects have been winning my focus and attention. i felt shocked and sad hearing the news but i also felt happy and liberated and immediately went to a center to help young entrepreneurs start their own business. i'd ultimately be doing the same thing except working for someone whom i actually respect üòâ. it's a move i'd thought about making for months now, the news this morning just shoved me, hard, in that direction .. i'm scared for a lot of new challenges but am very hopeful and confident in my abilities. i guess the *high* i'm on feels very odd and i want to be cautious as financially i only have a couple months to figure things out.. spiritually i'm happy but my analytical brain is biting it's nails clean off.... tldr: this is my first time getting laid off. is there a common process that happens of highs and lows? thanks for reading üòù	0

i've been lying to myself my entire life. and i've only just realized it. over the past year, a tumultuous relationship has been the dominating center of my existence. at the core of it, i know that i am madly in love with this amazing woman who has tirelessly shown me the deepest love i've ever known. that core is wrapped in infidelity, dishonesty, anger, and resentment. for a long time, i blamed her. much of our troubles could be easily chalked up,at a shallow level, to her jealousy and impassioned backlash. something i did express to more than one person when i was frustrated with our situation. i cheated on her. i kept other women on the sideline, constantly in contact, seeking attention, distraction, and cheap entertainment when i wanted it. she caught me. i told her it would never happen again. it happened again. no matter what i promised, there was always another line that i would cross, another inappropriate message i'd send, another advance i wouldn't completely brush aside. at first, i couldn't explain it - other than simple lust, i couldn't provide a satisfactory reason for my actions. i broke up with her. a few times. we fought. a hundred times. somehow, we always came back together. sometimes the connection was bordering on bizarre - we often commented, if either of us believed in universal interference, or supreme beings, that something kept pushing us back together. over the last year, she's worked to peel back the cover, tried to help me. she just wanted to know why; wanted to know it wouldn't happen again. over the last week, she stripped the final layer. i feel naked, weak, and vulnerable. i haven't slept much this weekend. maybe a few hours, with the help of a lot of weed. but i also feel an understanding. i have been, for most of my life, some toxic demonstration of "fake it til you make it". i was so ashamed of, uncomfortable with, myself, that i didn't feel i could show anyone who i was. nobody liked him. when i was 17, i found alcohol, and i felt closer. started smoking weed shortly after, and boy was i cool. at 18, someone showed me oxycontin. too expensive for the average party goer, this was an elite buzz. and i had a great hook-up. perfect for an ego chasing an image. by 20, most of my friends were in jail, rehab, or buried. i thankfully escaped any long-lasting consequence, and quit pills cold turkey. moved across the country to attend a tech school and start over. felt really good for a minute. i'm 10 years into a career in show production. i'm really good at my job. but i often feel inadequate, and am always conscious of those more advanced or more experienced than i. while that can be a good thing, i allowed it be a motivator of self-contempt. i began to play up my role sometimes, when telling stories of things i've done in my career. i've done enough actually crazy, unique, and interesting things that i can really sell you whatever inflated story i want. i'm a good liar. someone told me about tinder. i wish that fucking app had never been created. if that app had a high score board, i can almost guarantee i'd be on it. the ability to present myself, however i wanted, from the comfort of my own home? i rarely needed to buy more than 3 drinks at the bar before closing the deal. at that point, the purpose is served, and i rarely contacted any of these women a second time. i met the love of my life september of 2017. we'd met before, but in passing, and interactions were enjoyable but brief. this time it was charged, electric, exciting. our first date, a day of hiking and exploring small towns in the area, was one of the best days i've ever had. over the last year, i've hurt her more times than i can count. to feed my ego, to conceal my own insecurity, to fuel my own misplaced vanity... i sacrificed the wellbeing of the one person who tried to make me truly happy. i'm shocked at myself - realizing and finally seeing myself in real light for the first time in a long time... maybe ever. i've been a fucking monster. i'm so grateful to her. she stuck by my side through all of it. she helped me see. i don't know what's going to happen, but i'm not letting it go to waste. no matter if i have to charge into my future alone... i will not allow myself to repeat this cycle any further. i have a chance to show her that her efforts were not in vain, that i can be better. that it was a part, a characteristic, of me... but it will not be any more. i don't deserve her. god i'd do anything for her, though. üêôüñ§	0
