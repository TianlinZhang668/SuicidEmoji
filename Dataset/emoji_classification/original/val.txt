fuck life. fuck everything. you don't know what it's like to feel anxiety during every waking moment. there has never been a happy moment i have had that was not accompanied by that sinking, throbbing, fear just below the surface. i tried to go out and run today to get in shape. i ran through the park, hoping that maybe, i would start to feel "normal" here. i smiled and waved at people as i ran. "was this how it worked? am i doing it right?" i said to myself in my head. apparently not, because that creeping fear hit me every. single. time. even if they smiled and waved back, i was screaming inside my head. their voices caused my blood pressure to rise and fall. they had complete control over everything. i got back into my car, and i drove home. i felt desperate to not waste my day off, so i got my book of writing prompts and tried to write something down. nah. i played videogames instead. again. after 4 hours, i felt....bad. really bad. i kinda remembered how fucking awful my life was. and oh yeah, no friends either, so there was that. live with it. deal with it. haha, oh boy. 😂 there's really nothing left, guys. there hasn't been anything for a long time now. words are just words, and none of this matters. been nice, i guess. met some good people, watched some good movies. holy shit, wish i could've enjoyed them more. not really an option given how my mind is. i was born like this. guys, i really think that tonight is the night. i'm feeling absolutely dead right now. not in a peaceful way though. in this horrid, headache, furious, mad, thriving throbbing get it the fuck over with already kind of way. yikes	1
some reasons to stay alive 😀1. we would miss you. 2. it's not worth the regret. either by yourself, if you failed or just simply left scars or the regret everyone else feels by not doing enough to help you. 3. it does get better. believe it or not, it will eventually get better. sometimes you have to go through the storm to get to the rainbow. 4. there's so much you would miss out on doing. 5. there is always a reason to live. it might not be clear right now, but it is always there. 6. so many people care, and it would hurt them if you hurt yourself. 7. you are worth it. don't let anyone, especially yourself, tell you otherwise. 8. you are amazing. 9. a time will come, once you've battled the toughest times of your life and are in ease once again, where you will be so glad that you decided to keep on living. you will emerge stronger from this all, and won't regret your choice to carry on with life. because things always get better. 10. what about all the things you've always wanted to do? what about the things you've planned, but never got around to doing? you can't do them when you're dead. 11. i love you. even if only one person loves you, that's still a reason to stay alive. 12. you won't be able to listen to music if you die. 13. killing yourself is never worth it. you'll hurt both yourself and all the people you care about. 14. there are so many people that would miss you, including me. 15. you're preventing a future generation, your kids, from even being born. 16. how do you think your family would feel? would it improve their lives if you died? 17. you're gorgeous, amazing, and to someone you are perfect. 18. think about your favorite music artist, you'll never hear their voice again... 19. you'll never have the feeling of walking into a warm building on a cold day 20. listening to incredibly loud music 21. being alive is just really good. 22. not being alive is really bad. 23. finding your soulmate. 24. red pandas 25. going to diners at three in the morning. 26. really soft pillows. 27. eating pizza in new york city. 28. proving people wrong with your success. 29. watching the jerks that doubted you fail at life. 30. seeing someone trip over a garbage can. 31. being able to help other people. 32. bonfires. 33. sitting on rooftops. 34. seeing every single country in the world. 35. going on road trips. 36. you might win the lottery someday. 37. listening to music on a record player. 38. going to the top of the eiffel tower. 39. taking really cool pictures. 40. literally meeting thousands of new people. 41. hearing crazy stories. 42. telling crazy stories. 43. eating ice cream on a hot day. 44. more harry potter books could come out, you never know. 45. traveling to another planet someday. 46. having an underwater house. 47. randomly running into your hero on the street. 48. having your own room at a fancy hotel. 49. trampolines. 50. think about your favorite movie, you'll never watch it again. 51. think about the feeling of laughing out loud in a public place because your best friend has just sent you an inside joke, 52. your survival will make the world better, even if it's for just one person or 20 or 100 or more. 53. people do care. 54. treehouses 55. hanging out with your soul mate in a treehouse 56. snorting when you laugh and not caring who sees 57. i don't even know you and i love you. 58. i don't even know you and i care about you. 59. nobody is going to be like you ever, so embrace your uniqueness! 60. you won't be here to experience the first cat world emperor. 61. what about food?! you'll miss chocolate 62. starbucks. 63. hugs. 64. stargazing. 65. you have a purpose, and it's up to you to find out what it is. 66. you've changed somebody's life. 67. you could change the world. 68. you will meet the person that's perfect for you. 69. no matter how much or how little, you have your life ahead of you. 70. ( deg ? deg) 71. if you end your life, you're stopping yourself from achieving great things. 72. making snow angels. 73. making snowmen. 74. snowball fights. 75. life is what you make of it. 76. everybody has talent. 77. laughing until you cry. 78. having the ability to be sad means you have the ability to be happy. 79. the world would not be the same if you didn't exist. 80. it's possible to turn frowns, upside down 81. be yourself, don't take anyone's shit, and never let them take you alive. 82. heroes are ordinary people who make themselves extraordinary. be your own hero. 83. being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect. it means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections. 84. one day your smile will be real. 85. having a really hot, relaxing bath after a stressful day. 86. lying on the grass and laughing at the clouds. 87. getting completely smashed with your best friends. 88. eating crazy food. 89. staying up all night watching your favorite films with a loved one. 90. sleeping in all day. 91. creating something you're proud of. 92. you can look back on yourself 70 years later and be proud you didn't commit suicide. 93. being able to meet your internet friends. 94. tea / coffee / hot chocolate 95. the new season of sherlock 96. cuddling under the stars. 97. being stupid in public because you just can. 98. if you are reading this then you are alive! is there any more reason to smile? 99. being able to hug that one person you haven't seen in years 100. people care enough about you and your future to come up with 100 reasons for you not to do this. 101. but, the final and most important one is, just, being able to experience life. because even if your life doesn't seem so great right now, anything could happen.	1
how do i (23f) get over the pain of a friendship? it feels like the pain of a heartbreak if not worse i (23f) recently graduated college, and i'm learning how to deal with friendships ending. i have two friendships in particular that are hard for me. the most important one is my friend, let's call him joey (24m). joey has been one of my good friends since freshman year of college and recently moved to colorado this summer. i got a job out there too, and just moved here last week. i visited in the summer, and things were great. then all of a sudden he started being distant and aloof. now i'm actually living 20 minutes from him and he hasn't asked me any questions about my move or done anything any decent human would do when someone moves to a new city. i've invited him to dinner twice (once last week, and once this week) and both times i get a very noncommittal answer. i know this friendship is probably ending (probably because of his girlfriend that just moved in w him), and i need to learn how to accept it. it would make me feel really good to just tell him off and tell him he's being a dick, but i'm also thinking what if he has something else going on?? anyway, kind of ranting but what are people supposed to do in these kinds of situations? i have no family out here, and i'm just starting to make friends, but it's been pretty lonely. it makes it even worse knowing i have a good friend here that doesn't even want to see me. 😢 advice!? what do you do when you can feel yourself losing a friend?? tl;dr: moved to a new city, and longtime friend has been avoiding me.	0
why would someone ask: why do you like me? hello! i have this friend, we met some weeks ago and i wanted to be honest so i told him i liked him. he then asked me why, so i told him the truth and the things i liked about him. of course i know this is not a "it's something mutual" answer. i'm just curious about why would someone ask a question like this. 😳	0

😬 someone is trying really hard to ruin my night and it's making me uncomfortable not exactly the biggest deal in the world. but, earlier today 6pm someone hacked my spam instagram page. they changed the name, bio, profile picture, deleted pictures, posted pictures, dmed people, and followed a bunch of porn accounts. now a few of my friends and maybe some old people that i fell off with, but don't have problems with, have my password. now, i'm in high school and you know how it is, so most likely it just ended up getting to someone who thinks they're very funny and wanted to change my name to "fucking.nigs". i used to get bullied *pretty hard* so it could honestly be anyone. i changed my password and all and kinda laughed it off because only about 35 people follow that account because it's very personal and honestly i didn't really give a shit because nothing couldn't be undone. about 10 minutes later i get a popup of a new comment on a 52 day old reddit post i made in this sub. basically harassing me about my personal problems. pretty weird. so i check the account and it says it was made 4 minutes ago, had 1 karma and it was literally just the comment they made on my post. what a fucking creep. they can't fuck with my spam anymore so they decide to literally take the time to make an entire reddit account to make a mean, negative, personal comment on a 52 day old post about how the people on reddit make me feel better. 😬 not many people know i have a reddit let alone knowing my username so basically this person is kinda a weirdo and either obsessed with trying to get a reaction out of me, hates me, or just thinks they're hilarious. i also don't really want to know how or why they got my reddit but it was very obviously the same person from my spam. got to thinking it could be a secretly hateful friend but ruled that out so quick because i don't have many friends in the first place. thought it could be my ex since the reddit comment sounds just like him even with a very tiny slightly similar username, he knows i use reddit, and he did have my instagram password all this time but he would never ever be so childish especially not use the n word over and over. plus i don't think he wants any type of association with me or my life. that's really not something i want to think about. probably not very likely, just some dumbass high school kid who wants a reaction. didn't ruin my night but some people, man. i don't know.	0
i'm [14f] just done. i don't know anymore. i'm not okay. everyone thinks i am. i'm alone. sure, i may have a lot of friends that care, but no one would want to talk to me right now, not when i'm on the verge of finding something to cut myself with for the first time. my mom yells at me for panic attacks. she knows i'm at a disadvantage when it comes to mental illnesses (my dad is bipolar, so i have some genetic stuff, which has caused my brother to have anxiety). i'm pretty sure i have depression or anxiety (i typed suicide instead at first, whoops!) or something. and i don't know what to do anymore. i'm gonna start up therapy with a different therapist, who i can hopefully open up with more. but not for another few weeks. and i know i'm not in a good place mentally right now. i don't know what i need. just, i'm done. i'm sorry. you don't need to be reading this. i'm just being a whiny bitch. millions of couples with children divorce, thousands (probably) of grandmas are transplant lists. millions upon millions have insane amount of stress. i'm normal. sorry for wasting your time... 😥	0
done okay... so i'm 16 and autistic and my life fucking sucks today. i've liked a girl online for a few weeks since we crossed paths and she's the most beautiful thing i've ever crossed paths with, if i'm honest. she cared for me in tough times, complimented me and all that stuff. anyway, i plucked up the courage to mention it to her and when i did her reaction was quite subtle, she didn't say anything either way. i was just like 'i'll go, it's fine' and she was like 'no no no i like you too' and we basically spoke and decided we'd give stuff a go because she was worried she'd have her heart broken. not gonna lie, we got soppy af with compliments and the i love you shit and paragraphs, typical 16yo stuff. her ex was on to her, let's call him j. 😂 she said she had told that they just needed to be friends and he kept getting cushy with her so i messaged him. > **me**: i don't mind you two being close but just back off a bit > **him**: fuck off basically, i woke up this morning to go stroll out and get my hair cut. she'd messaged me and said she loved me but this wasn't going to work out. obviously i asked why and she told me her ex had asked her out. i was wandering around asda (the uks walmart) by that time and i started getting teary and just looking at the floor. she told me she'd said yes. i just wanted to die. as soon as i got out of the shop, i got into my dad's car with my family and burst into tears. no one heard anything until 10 minutes later when my brother noticed and my dad and step-mum weren't that bothered. i just said i was fine and we went on. anyway, i slept for most of today alongside crying. i've never ever cried this much since my grandad died. i want to go and i want the pain to go too. 😔	1

is he (m27) cheating? i'm a girl that isn't looking for anything serious at the moment. i got out of an 8 year relationship almost 2 years ago and still enjoy being single for the time being. i met a man off tinder over year ago. we agreed to be fuck buddies but never slept together on the first date because i didn't want to drop my pants without knowing the guy a bit. we had a great first date filled with lots of kissing. after that time we never met again (this was december 2017). he ghosted me, i flaked on him a lot and that was the cycle for all of 2018. he'd compliment me a lot and try making plans but i was busy. when i wasn't busy he was busy. but i didn't care much for him other than finding him very attractive and fun. every month he'd message me and reply to my instagram stories to remind me he's still alive 😂 i'd do that to him every once in a while too haha. i just found this whole silly game funny and never took anything seriously. now the issue, he wanted to meet up with me in december (2018) but the plan was never implemented. i posted a modest nude of myself on new year's eve which he responded to saying " damn i want to see more of you in the new year. happy new year cutie keep up the 🔥 in 2019 😍" i said "haha we keep flaking on one another though 😂" and he said "just waiting for the right time i guess 😂" hours later he posted videos of him and this girl at a formal new year's eve party! i know this girl has been a hook up for him for over a year but he never started posting her till november of last year. clearly this man is a player. i know this but i also don't care. anyways he's been posting many things with this girl in january since they have been clearly spending most days of the week together and he doesn't mind showing her off which is cute. he booty-called me about 3 weeks ago which i was surprised about because i thought this girl was a gf or just someone he was planning on getting serious with. i rejected the booty call by saying "i only sleep with people i know well and vibe with and i don't know you well :( i'm sure you'll be able to find someone tonight! have so much fun" and he said "i did thank you 😉 have fun cutie". a couple weeks later he posted cute valentine's videos with her. it seemed like the got super serious about 2 weeks ago and be booty called me 3 weeks ago? they spend so much time together and she's constantly in his posts. he views all my stories i post religiously still. but never likes any of my new pics anymore like he use to. i am seeing other men. but i hate people that cheat since i've been cheated on before. so i'm just trying to figure out if he is? cuz then i should block him. idc if he's single and plays these silly games cuz they don't phase me then **tl;dr**: if he's not satisfied with the girl why is he dating her? i think he's just a shit person but maybe he's still single? i know he cares for her as a friend. but he barely knows me and booty called me so idk if he's cheating or just has a fwb he likes to show the world he's dating now. but never showed her face before	0

how do you motivate yourself to get back up after some type of disappointment i (18), had this test at school and i had spent days studying for it. and i was really hoping to do well in it. well, it turns out that everything that went wrong, went wrong. i made countless errors and coming out of the test and hearing the answers my friends got in the test, i feel like such a complete dumbass. i feel like i have been kicked in the balls and it really hurts. it really put me in a really bad and unmotivated mood for the whole day. i this legit fear of being looked at as stupid when i know i am not. i work hard, i am committed and i invest a lot of my time and energy into my academics. it just really sucks that this type of thing can happen from time to time. and when it does, i begin to feel like i am less than or something. i have been told in the past by my sister that i should just calm down and stop overreacting. but setbacks like this sometimes leave so dejected that i just don't see the pont of putting in the grind anymore. i have goals and i know i can achieve them. but i just sucks when you look so dumb sometimes. i was just wondering if anyone has had this feeling or is it just me needing attention. thank you for reading 🙏🏾	0

thinking of getting acrylic nails ^_^ i've made an effort two weeks ago to stop biting my nails once and for all. it worked some how i have nails now! buuut however this week was not such a good week for me because i had super high anxiety and i bit my nails ;-; omg i was so mad at myself but my anxiety couldn't help it. so anyway it's 6am and i'm thinking " hm i should get acrylic nails so that my natural nails could grow underneath without me biting them. " i'm scared though because i don't know where to get them done well. i say well because some nail technicians aren't experienced with doing acrylic nails and they do it wrong resulting in damaging your natural nail. ( i used to watch a lot of nailcareereducation so 👍) yeah i had no one to talk to about this that's why i'm on reddit hah	0

daughter [25 f] trying to provide emotional support to depressed father w/ anger issues and possible early neurodegeneration [68 m]; abusive history tl;dr: my dad is ashamed of ruining our family's financial situation and feels useless - you could say that he feels "emasculated". he alternately beats himself up and takes his anger out on us. he refuses to see the doctor about his chronic health problems and seems to be waiting to die. we are worried that he is going to hurt himself and maybe hurt someone else. how can i be more supportive when i actually am angry about what he did/didn't do for the family and angry with him for being abusive in the past? i'm sorry that this is so disjointed. there is a lot to say here. **the backdrop** *the emotional volatility & abuse* my father has had long-standing emotional issues. he bounces back and forth from volatile and explosive to passive-aggressive and manipulative. he was physically abusive to my older brother [37 m]. for example, after a particularly cruel turn with the belt in 5th grade, my brother was bedridden and had to stay home from school for 2 days. before he mellowed out in old age, he was verbally abusive to all of us. when i was 5, he tried the belt with me, but my brother (17 at the time) threatened to put him in the hospital and effectively put a stop to that behavior with me. after saying things like "i hate you" and "kill yourself", he tries to earn back your love with favors and by buying you stuff. he seems to feel sorry for saying what he does, but you may be lucky to get one terse apology. he hates admitting when he has done wrong. he doesn't show many other signs of borderline personality disorder because he's more avoidant than anything else, but the catchphrase "i hate you, don't leave me" to describe bpd behavior really sounds a lot like how he acts sometimes. *my parent's shitty, obligatory marriage* he and my mother's marriage is (unsurprisingly) weak. they have slept in separate rooms my entire life and only married because my mom got pregnant with my older brother. i suspect that she wanted to divorce him when she got pregnant with me a decade later but stayed out of duty and obligation (they are religious and conservative) as well as economic necessity (until recently, he made 2-3x what she earned). nowadays, they hardly talk except when i'm in the room. he keeps his earbuds in all day listening to alex jones and other conspiracy theory podcasts and youtube channels. the earbuds drive my mom crazy. he hates the fact that she is the breadwinner now, but my mom has told me that this is a not a new pattern with him. when i was a baby, they had to declare bankruptcy and my mom had to work two jobs like she does now. apparently, he used to pick at her and they would fight. he was ashamed at himself for not being the provider ™️, but also mad at her for taking the title away from him. i told her that she has my approval if she wants to leave him, but she says that she feels obligated to stay. she is probably right that he would not be able to take care of himself. (more on that later) *financial failure* 7 years ago when i was in high school, my dad lost his job, and things took a turn for the worse. he controls the finances completely and was scammed out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in get rich quick schemes. all of his savings are gone, and they have almost lost the house several times. ashamed of what he has done, he only admits what is going on when he runs completely out of money and can't keep his creditors at bay. my mom has pilfered her own measly retail worker savings to pay when these situations arise. for the next few years after he lost his job, he had a chance to find others though at a significant paycut. this is when he got involved in the get rich quick schemes. he had been scammed years before by other schemes when he was still holding a job, but he put every cent into the latest ones. *health problems and self-punishment* now, it would be really difficult for him to work due to his deteriorating health. i suspect that he is too proud to take retail jobs that might overlook his handicaps. he is going blind due to macular degeneration and shows signs of dementia or alzheimer's. in addition to the more normal signs of senility like forgetting grocery store items and forgetting conversations, he even occasionally forgets what basic objects are. my mom and i joke between ourselves about a conversation he had with me where he forgot what lasagna was. he's eaten it before, and he's cooked it before, but when i told him to put frozen lasagna on the grocery list, he said "lasagna? i don't know what that is. never heard of it". he also has high blood pressure and heart problems. he quit his medication cold turkey despite having to have had heart surgery twice in the past. he won't go to the doctor no matter how much we beg and even though he has medicare and va benefits that will pay for it. he makes excuses about not trusting "big pharma", but i also think it's because he honestly does not care about his health and subconsciously hopes to die. this suspicion was partly confirmed when he made an offhand comment the other day about getting a free funeral for him at a veteran's cemetery. when i told him that he would be getting a proper burial and funeral and that we wouldn't be taking the cheap option, he changed topics. *approval-seeking meets ocd* he has compulsions regarding dishes, laundry, and the cleanliness of the front yard. this is in stark contrast to how he treats his room - which is filled to be the brim with stuff he has hoarded. he has rituals he has to follow in the designated clean ocd areas and gets upset when you trip them up. the passive-aggressive questions about dirty dishes and leaves left on the cars is enough to aggravate my mom, but he also rolls them into trying to get attaboys from my mom. whenever he sweeps the leaves, he repeatedly asks if she noticed. since she doesn't really care about the leaves in the front yard, he never gets the recognition he wants. he also goes to the store and buys sweets for us that we didn't ask for and sometimes don't even like all that much. when we aren't ecstatic about the oreos or reese's he bought, he sulks. **the most recent episode** last night, i got into a fight with my dad over politics that quickly became personal. my mom and i were talking about racism against black people (we are white), and the conversation also turned to sexism. my dad, who is a conservative southerner, took offense and started launching alt-right talking points about how western civilization is over and that we could "take (racism and sexism) up with our new chinese overlords". he turned purple and started screaming at us different versions of "all white men are evil, and we should all be killed!". i told him repeatedly that this is not what we were saying and that non-white men and women just want a seat at the table, but the whole conversation was unsalvageable at that point. i think it got so personal so fast because he got ripped off on getting an oil change that same day and we yelled at him. he allowed some guy to talk him into getting some premo, deluxe package that cost $120 for one car. (as you might have gathered, my dad is an easy mark for sleazy salesmen). my mom and i got mad at him about it because it meant we couldn't afford to get oil changes for other cars. this was just another, emasculating failure ™️ for him, which is why he had the meltdown over killing all white males. after the fight, my mom and i hopped in the car and drove away for a few minutes, worrying about leaving the dogs beyond. we were both worried that he could hurt them or hurt himself. both of us have feared him in previous fights. i wish i was being hyperbolic when i say that i have feared that he would kill me before. from my mom's silence last night when i told her this, i gathered that she has felt the same way before. i don't know how to talk him about all of this, as we never talked about our issues before. he would just blow up and then bribe and guilt trip me into forgiving him. as much as i talk badly about him here, we actually have a lot in common - most of it negative. i too have struggled with self-hatred, self-harm, and suicidal ideation, so i can understand where he's coming from, but i feel unable to come up with the words he seems to want to hear.	0

so i need some anonymous people to listen to my rantsooooo thank you for sorting new first of all, i'm someone who's far in the hole. i've stopped caring about how people will care when i'm dead, sure they'll be sad, theyll mourn, they'll cry, they'll probably even end up with a internal dialog worse then mine, but they'll get better. they've been through worse, and they'll continue going through worse and worse things. why'd i be different? i mean sure, i'm friends with people, i'm the first son, i'm the guy people can turn to and just let shit out and i'm the guy who'll do everything in his power to try to fix it. but i can't keep going feeling like i'm doing everything wrong, i can't keep going thinking i'm letting my gf down, i can't keep going counting the days before she starts doing shit with other people - thinking about ending it with me, i can't deal with the heartbreak i'd feel knowing this is the happiest i'll feel with someone and have them step on me. do i deserve it? sure. but do i want it? hell no. would i be surprised? not even alittle. recently i've been wanting to drink, i want that kick of something strong and not remember the night beforehand. i don't want to remember half the shit that i do. is it selfish? hell yeah. most of what my moms told me is the reason i'm turning to a bunch of people reading through reddit at 2300 when they have a exam in the morning. (go tf to sleep, god knows i want to.) i'm only here because i keep going back and forth on whether i want to take people with me or just goto sleep. i wish someone could hold me and make it better, but i know that's not how that works way to well. eating's getting scarce, no appetite anymore. schools suffering, (teacher deadass told me to give up xd) my motivation is gone, i don't enjoy anything i do anymore, and i feel like i'm far too gone. been feeling that way sense 6th grade. uhhhhhh other then that, i just want to do enough shit that i can't feel anything anymore. thank you for reading, i'll update as needed. those of you feeling the same way, don't follow my example, you have people who love you. i love you. gimme a smooch 😘 thank you for reading through this. the pins in my head are digging deeper and deeper, so i'm gonna bawl my eyes out. ttyl	1
i have cavities! what the heck?! that's so embarrassing! cavities are something kids get, right?! 😭 i haven't had any work (aside from regular cleanings) done on my teeth since i got my wisdom teeth out at 16. now i'm 25, and my dentist tells me today i've developed two little cavities. apparently he's been watching the spots for a couple years and they're finally big enough for him to work on. so i got 2 surprise fillings today... i was never really scared of the dentist before but for some reason today i totally bitched out. i was shaking the whole time, i even cried a little bit. it didn't even hurt! i have no idea why i got so upset! ugh. anyway, any other adults out there with cavities? i guess i'll be flossing and using mouthwash tonight.	0

unintentionally playing drunk hide and seek at a christmas day party event. my girlfriend and i are visiting her family in germany over the christmas period and as a present, her uncle and aunt bought us tickets to a popular christmas day disco/party. before going, we went to one of their friends houses to pre drink and at that point the night was going well. my first mistake of the evening, however, was combining schnapps with strong german beer after not having drunk for a good 5 months or so. needless to say this got me completely wasted. when we got to the event, things were apparently going well (i had to rely on other people's memories to know this). my second mistake for the evening was going off to find a bathroom. after somehow managing to locate one in my inebriated, sleep-walking state i found myself lost. so after walking around for a few minutes, i returned to the bathroom to compose myself. the problem was that the toilet was much more comfortable than what i remembered initially and i found myself drifting off. after some much needed r&r, i was awoken about 4 hours later by a security guard throwing toilet paper at me from over the toilet stall telling me what i assume translated to: "get the fuck off the toilet and come with me." i followed the lovely gentleman to the first aid area, and then out to the front of the building where i found my girlfriend balling her eyes out and her entire extended german family, who were present at the event, wrapping up their search for me. it was here that i learnt the security, police and just about every person we knew had been looking for me for the past 4 hours. apparently my girlfriend's uncle had almost gotten into a fight after banging on just about every bathroom stall (male and female) in their fruitless search for me. i was then placed in the car, taken home and nestled my way to sleep with my comfortable pillow-bucket™️. as a punishment for my actions the night before, the gods saw fit to bestow upon me the hangover of the century and i have now spent the day curled up in a ball of shame and self-pity. needless to say, that wasn't how i planned to spend the festive season. tl;dr: passed out on a toilet and became the christmas 2015 hide and seek champion.	0

i (20sf) am questioning my fiance's (30sm) honesty and commitment to our relationship - he may have cheated... please help my fiance and i have a pretty solid relationship, or at least i thought we did. we've been together almost a year now but we've known each other for a long time. maybe we jumped into things too fast, i don't know. the first 6 months of our relationship were amazing and basically perfect, we rarely fought or disagreed and when we did disagree we were always able to talk/work through things in a respectful way that made me feel that we both truly valued our relationship. he's absolutely my best friend. in july of this year we moved in together and a week or so after we moved in together i found out that the girl he had been telling me was his best and oldest friend was also his fwb for months leading up to our relationship. i was pretty devastated. not because he had a past before me, that's fine, but because i thought we had an amazing, open, honest relationship and finding out that he'd been dishonest about his past with her made me feel kind of lied to. this shook us a lot, but we talked through it and we moved forward. he told me that he hadn't slept with her since we got together and hadn't seen her either and he told me that because of the nature of their relationship he was going to cut contact with her so i wouldn't feel uncomfortable. this was all in july/august. we got engaged earlier this month and i was absolutely thrilled to be marrying my best friend until this past weekend. he got a new phone and in the process of trying to help him back up his old phone and sync it with his new phone, i saw texts between the two of them. i shouldn't have looked as thoroughly as i did, i totally acknowledge and admit that. i discovered that even though he told me he was going to cut contact, he continued to text her in the days after that. he eventually did stop talking to her but wasn't totally honest about how quickly. i guess that's ok, they were friends for a long time and i get it. he made me out to be a total ass though, and allowed her to tell him what an "immature, insecure, jealous piece of shit" i was and he said nothing to defend me. i don't care what he's done, i would never let someone talk about him like that. he also did see and spend time with her in the time that we were dating, he was even hitting her up for sex in the first month of our relationship (before we were exclusive). when i tried to talk to him about this he acknowledges that he wasn't honest about his contact with her but insists that he "doesn't recall" ever seeing her all of the times that the texts say that they met up. i mean they explicitly say "hey, i'm stopping at (grocery store) need anything?" "no, i'm good thanks." "hey, i'm here :p" but he insists he doesn't remember hanging out with her. this is a man who literally remembers everything down to the exact date it happened. he can tell you the dates of every major and insignificant thing he's ever done in his life, but he doesn't remember if he saw her? i just can't believe it, and i can't help but think that if he's lying about seeing her, he probably slept with her again. reddit, i feel like i'm being a total ass, but right now i can't look at him the same way anymore. he is the sweetest person i know but would text her things like "i miss you❤️" and "going over to angryblumpkin's place tonight, probs just gonna do dinner and fuck ;)" and make me out to be just a hookup when we were in a serious, committed (so i thought) relationship. i don't know who this person is but i can't help but think that if this is his oldest friend, his interactions with her are probably a better reflection of the kind of person he is. am i being totally crazy? i've been in some really terrible emotionally/physically abusive relationships in the past, i have trust issues and my sketchy gauge is all messed up. i'm struggling to figure out whether i'm being totally unreasonable or he is really being sketchy. it's worth mentioning that it doesn't look like he's had any contact with her since september of this year. tldr; boyfriend, now fiance, sent inappropriate/flirty texts to an old friend he used to sleep with while we were dating, potentially met up with her even though he told me they hadn't hung out since we started dating, and says he "doesn't recall" whether they ever met up. i feel like he's not the man i agreed to marry now, am i being crazy?	0

i deleted my social media! i've been putting off deleting my social media for a while now. now that i've done it, i don't feel particular different or "liberated".. but the good thing is that i don't miss it and don't feel like i'm missing out like i used to think before. good riddance. but the thing is, i'm compensating by spending more time on reddit lol. but for me there's not much comparison between reddit and other social media platform. in reddit i spend a lot of time, but in the end i'm learning something new all the time, or at least i'm talking with cool people and get all kinds of different perspectives. while other social media is nothing but a mindless and aimless scrolling. long live reddit 💕	0

found my grandpa's tribute video i never really knew my grandpa. he was in hospital and bed ridden for most of my early years so i rarely saw him, maybe visited twice a year. i was 6 when he passed away. i moved away from my home country when i was 3, nearly 4, so wasn't in the country when he had passed. i heard a great many things about him growing up. my mother always uses weird nicknames to refer to people and she would say they were nicknames she picked up from him. he was a well humoured but humble man who was very soft spoken and a great father. as the years have progressed, i have always shot myself down for not spending enough time with him and for not appreciating him enough when i still could. but i was young and knew no better. recently, i was digging through drawers in pursuit of a usb stick. and i found one. i plugged it into my laptop and waited for it to load up. when i click on the folder, to my surprise, i'm greeted with a picture of him and a powerpoint. i click on the powerpoint and soon realise its his little funeral tribute. i watch it and start crying because i never attended the funeral and didn't really understand the concept of death at 6. rest in peace oupa ❤️	0

the wild (suicide note)the wild in the wild, there is a system, a hierarchy. in the wild there are politics, there are economics, there are social groups, there are families, and there is a food chain. in the wild we can see that everything is divided in groups, there are states, counties and borders that should not be crossed. every animal group has their own system or way of doing things, elephants for example have a matriarch system, there is a chief elephant that leads their herd, there are family groups composed of moms, dads, sons, daughters and even uncles. they have social groups within the herd. when a link between the elephants is broken or one of the elephant dies, the other elephants mourn their lost or their break-up. we can also see systems in other animals like lions. not that the disney®️ movie "the lion king" is entirely true, but there is some true to some of the behaviors seen in the movie. like the alpha male being the king and the leader, this behavior is really seen in the wild. the females hunt and the male sits all day guarding the "house". these animals are intelligent enough to create hierarchies and to assign roles. there are multiple examples of systems in the wild, but what about humans, what about our systems, our politics, our economy, our social groups. how do we reflect the close to perfect systems that the "lower" species develop. there is a factor that limits our development process of successful systems. betrayal... in the wild, it is very rare to see same species animals betray their own kin. but among humans this is a really dominant factor, in politics, in economy and other "effective systems" that we've created. we see betrayal when a politician promises change, but delivers misery and poverty to his people. we see betrayal in economy when a person that makes (apparently) not enough money to survive this terrible life, steals from the poor to satisfy his own greedy and vicious needs. we see betrayal in our social development and social groups. before we are born we could easily be betrayed by our mother who chose to abort because her life is a miserable piece of crap and a baby wont make it any better. but if you do get the chance to be born, you get betrayed on every single step of your life, no matter how much you learn about life and its evil ways, you'll get betrayed by the one you call brother, the one you call friend and sometimes even the one you don't call anything because you don't even know them. that's how fucked up this world is. you get betrayed when you fall in love, you get betrayed when you think out load, when you speak, when you dream, in fact when you do anything, you are sure to get betrayed. you may ask yourself, " why is this happening to me?" and trust me, eventually you'll realize that nothing in this god damned world is worth it. nothing is worth it, not knowledge, not being popular or famous, not being rich, not being the pretties or cutest person in the world, nothing and i repeat nothing is worth it. because as all the other animals in the wild all humans really need, other than food, sleep, and a well given bath, is love. every animal no matter what the species is needs love. we all need a special someone. but just imagine how screwed up the world is that we prefer to betray our friends, family, and sometimes even ourselves to make someone else's life a living hell, and you know you've gone your way at some point in your life to make someone miserable. this is something we don't see in the wild because animals understand the commitment and the responsibility that comes with living in this world and enjoying your stay in this shit hole while it lasts. we also don't see this shitty behavior in the wild because animals don't have the mental capacity to hate, they don't have the mental capacity to betray or to backstab their friends. if there is one thing i've learned from life experiences is to not befriend anyone, just smile and wave, or just learn their names and call them by that because humans are so vain that they love listening to their own name (narcissistic son's of bitches that we are huh). so thats one of the things i've learned, but like i said this means nothing, absolutely nothing is worth anything in this nickel back piece of crap world. i know i may seem rude or just seem like an ass, but thats what you get when you go into the wild. you learn to survive and eat every single being that crosses your path. a few days ago i came up with the phrase "let's do it!", what i really meant to say was lets not do anything and lets just sit here and do nothing until death proclaims our miserable bodies, because i feel like this life is less shitty when you just do nothing. why because you can't hurt or get hurt, and people say that pain makes us grow... well guess what that is the biggest pile of bull shit i've ever heard. human beings did not evolve for 8 million years to live in pain. we evolved because there were some basic necessities that we needed to take care of and that caused changes in the human body to adapt our physical nature to nature itself. what i really hate is when people say that love is not a relevant thing... okay... okay... let's see how you handle everyone rejecting you and not being able to love. you'll go fucking nuts in less than a few hours, specially in this society where our emotions and our souls are driven by facebook and twitter. to be a little more practical, start a facebook profile, get tons of likes and then close your account... you'll come back to the computer screen like a love searching moth in the dark. we are love whores, we need love, we need it so much that when your family abandons you, your friends become the filthiest assholes in the universe, and your dog doesn't want you to pet him, we turn to god for a loving hand... could you be a bit less stupid please, god loves you and he loves everyone but the kind of love that humans need is not the love of an invisible being that created the world and humans themselves. humans need the word, and no im not talking about the bible. im talking about the literal word "love". why do i say this... well growing up with a mom that worked all day and a step dad that had a love-hate relationship with me, sometimes all i needed was a word, a word used in the context of the famous phrase "i love you", and don't tell me that you don't like hearing those words together. i just wish i would have been given the opportunity to choose between a wealthy life and the love of a mother. i didn't really ever feel that so i don't know what love is. ive been in multiple relationships, all of which failed miserably because i don't know how to love and my attitude is shit. a lot of people suffer from shitty attitude syndrome, which is basically being an asshole, and only enough some male's and female's across the globe fall for this kind of behavior because they think its attractive, well its not and all the people who like these bad attitudes are stupid and should be put in a mental institution to get some serious treatments. but this attraction is not always our fault, because the fault is definitely in our stars, the fault is in out way of thinking about other people. for example, i used to think my stage manager for the traveling theatre group in college was cute, and i was filled with joy every time i saw her face or talked to her, but then came the betrayal, she liked my friend, and even though i wasn't completely satisfied with this i decided to pursue the dream of one day being given the chance to join her in a relationship. even though she did not know and will probably never find out, this was something that bothered me and killed me inside. ive always been the type of person that likes to listen so whenever i got the chance to talk to her i would listen to all the lovee dovee things that she had to say, in my mind i couldn't give three shits about what she thought about him, cause i a guy and im straight, but in my face i would reply with the typical "mhhm" which is not very intelligent if you're trying to get a girl to like you, but at some point along the way of liking her i started to see her interest in him getting very strong, to the point where friends would go out to eat and they wouldn't invite me. which in case you don't know is a fucking big deal okay! but what was i to do...? nothing, nothing at all. i didn't have to do anything because i decided to quit the thought of ever existing and i decided to kill myself. this is not a suicide letter, it's a cry for love. i really need someone to roam the savannah with me, to show me the beautiful skies of kenya. i need someone to help me fight for my life in the wild.	1
taking a nap i was supposed to meet my boyfriend at my house around 11pm to pick up his sister at the airport at midnight. i offered to drive with him for company and to take my car, since his isn't in the most amazing shape. i was ready and everything and decided to take a nap to make up for being out so late a night before work. i set two alarms, and my phone was right next to me so i could wake up immediately. the phone was right next to me so i think i just turned them off without even realizing or fully waking up. i wake up at 3 am and see all the missed calls and texts from my boyfriend. i slept through both alarms and his call. he doesn't know the key code to my house so he couldn't just come in and wake me up. he waited for like 30-40 minutes before leaving. he told me yesterday it wasn't a problem if i couldn't go and didn't use my car, but i feel terrible. i feel like i let him down and it's a relatively new relationship 😞😞. him waiting for me outside my house just makes me feel like such a knob tl:dr - i set an alarm, slept through it, and didn't wake up to take my boyfriend to the airport to meet somebody. i doubt he's seriously mad, i just feel terrible and super anxious now because it's about 4 am and i can't talk to him to apologize for another half day probably	0

i caused a fight in the class groupchat so i posted this before but didnt explain what happened. some alt girl in my old class posted on instagram how she hates superstraight people, i commented on that that i were "✨superstraight✨" and proud as a joke and that it would be hypocritical if she would hate on it. eventually there was a fight with her and all the guys and she called everyone transphobic because we prefer a girl that has always been a girl, it went on for hours and eventually i dissapeared. *no i dont hate lgtbq *yes i would only date a girl that has always been a girl since birth *cant cancel me if i dont care	0

every day. every f-ing day.it's like i'm used to being suicidal. every damn day i think about it. about ending it all. it's so damn torturous because i'm too goddamn pussy to do anything. i'm stuck in this trap and i don't have the guts to do anything. every day i keep telling myself that it'll get better. but it doesn't. i'm sick of lying to myself. i can't just ignore my feelings. but if i go near them i just wanna die. no one can empathise with me. i just drag everybody down. i'm not good with girls. never have been never will be. and it's so disgusting. i'm fine with the idea of dying. suicidal ideation is as normal to me as my name. it's becoming a sick fantasy of mine. everywhere i go, i go with a smile, because it's the only way to get anyone to interact with me. but no one knows the help i need. which is ironic-since most of the time i don't want it. i want death, but life clings to me like a disease. i wish i could take the place of some poor soul who wants to live but will die soon so that they could live. 😔	1

ex sending mixed signals **me [17m] and my ex [18f] broke up about three weeks ago.** lately she has been really nice and almost flirty in person. like laughing at stuff i da that is not really funny and then reeealy laughing at stuff i say that is. and also like doodling on my paper during class and writing "you suck". (we sit next to each other), pointing out how veiny my arms are 😏. stuff like that. but then not in person she is really cold seeming. like leaving me on read and two or three word answers. not responding to my streaks on snapchat that day "how is everyone doing". it's like she's two different people. **can anyone explain this behavior?** tldr: ex girlfriend is acting different in person vs over text/snap.	0

how i nailed two birds with one stone so a few months ago i saw a video on instagram of andy samberg making some guys sing "i want it that way" and i thought it'd be fun to watch the show. i was confident i knew what show it was so i went straight on down to netflix and searched "the office". i started watching it and my first thought was "this camera recording is so much worse than that instagram video". after i was 5 minutes in, i discovered it was the wrong show. a few days later, i found the actual show, brooklyn nine-nine and it was actually so funny and so good. one of those shows with obviously bad acting that's funny regardless. i watch all seasons in a week and then i had nothing else to watch on netflix. one day though, i was drawing and i needed background noise so i put on the office... wasn't background noise anymore. i got really into it... dangerously into it and i would watch it non-stop and it was non-stop laughter. (tl;dr i searched for the wrong show and it turned out to be right for me all along 😏)	0

building my own computer so yesteday i got all the parts for a 1200$ computer. i used pretty much all day building it following a guide on youtube, and i was feeling quite confident i was doing the right things. however, the computer wouldn't turn on after all the parts were connected. i suspected the power supply wasn't strong enough, so i tried booting the computer without connecting the graphics card to the power supply. i don't know if it was a good thing that the fans started, because i thought that meant my power supply wasn't strong enough for the graphics card, but at least it started. i have literally 0 experience with computers prior to this, and the only thing that got me that far was the guide. while the computer was running, i connected the graphics card to the power supply, and the whole thing stopped. i have since tried turning it on, but to no success. after consulting with a friend, i found out that there's a high possibility of either my graphics card, power supply or even motherboard being broken. my mother advised me to go or a prebuilt computer, but i wanted to build my own, so she was pretty negative about this whole thing from before and said that i was going to break something. i repeatedly told her that nothing would happen, but it seems she proved me wrong. i don't know how to face her with this. we used so much money, and the broken parts are pretty expensive. edit: parts: kingston ssdnow v300 120gb 2.5" oem hyperx fury ddr3 1600mhz 8gb gainward geforce gtx 960 2gb (relevant) corsair carbide 300r midi tower asus z97-a, socket-1150 (relevant) corsair cx 600m, 600w psu (relevant) seagate barracuda®️ 1tb	0
genders and sexual deviations this should be a reddit question...i'll forward it. someone asked me how many genders there are? i've lost count. seems like there are more everyday. but in the last section that i added i believe these to be psycho-sexual devations as opposed to genders. anyone care to jump in?? heterosexual homosexual bisexual asexual pansexual demi-sexual (no sexual attraction unless there is an emotional attachment) transexual there are a few others i can't remember. there's also being born as a hermaphrodite, both genders. now being called intersexual. often the parents will be encouraged to chose the gender at birth and corrective surgery is performed. sometimes the child will feel like he/she is being raised as the wrong gender. so that's #8 then you have males and females born with duplicate genitals. #9 also born genderless (extremely rare) #10 ___________________________________________________ beastiality (those that prefer animals) prefer inanimate objects (cars for example) pedophilia (children 😢) necrophilia (sex with the dead) but are these considered genders or psychological sexual deviations?? i believe them to be psycho-sexual devations from the norm and not gender related but since they are considered sexual behaviors i went ahead and included them in the discussion.	0
congratulations to graduates (my older brother included) of 2018!!! y'all did it!!! 🤘🏼i'm dedicating this post to my brother! hey graduates of 2018! i'd like to congratulate y'all and my brother on your achievement! doesn't matter if you cared about your graduation or not, i do. it matters enough to me and i wanna make it known. my brother's gonna walk in a hour or so. he's done his best to graduate. i don't know if he's walking for himself or my parents, but i'm very proud of him for his effort and the fact that he cares enough about my parents to do everything he can to graduate. my parents left their home, parents, siblings, relatives, and nearby neighbors to start anew for my and my siblings' future. not a penny to their name and knowing only a few words in english, they headed to america with my uncle, who sponsored my family, 13 years ago. the whole process and paperwork took 13 years, so 26 years total since my uncle submitted the paperwork to sponsor us. sadly, he passed away right before i graduated. we came from a country that values education and teachers. my parents' wish has always been for us to have a better life than theirs, and obtaining a bachelor's degree is the traditional and only way they approve. they don't have a bachelor's degree but have been believing the only way to have a better future is to obtain a bachelor's degree; so i can see why they want us to have it. dad stopped after 6th grade (or sooner) to support his parents and 6 siblings financially; mom completed senior year of high school and started working since then. i'm fortunate enough to be the first to graduate from college and got a job since graduation to support my family. though the job has been temporary, i am blessed to be employed everyday. :) please don't criticize my parents for only supporting the traditional path to success, i.e. obtaining a bachelor's degree. they truly believe the path to success is through education, and the first step is to graduate from a four-year college. that's how much they value education. it's been the only way they know even though there are many stories of successful and famous people who are college dropouts. you have guessed it right. we're asians. ^___^ i'm also fortunate to move to the states at the age where my brain could still pick up the language relatively quickly. my brother, on the other hand, moved here, together with my whole family, when he was almost 18. therefore, he's been struggling with the language since. that's why completing his bs degree in computer science has taken so long. his shyness and being introverted also didn't help him in learning the language either. but after 11 years at different colleges, he's finally walking!!!!!!!!! woooo!!!!! i am so proud of him!!!!! i'm raised in a family that isn't familiar with expressing love verbally or physically, like hugging. however, we know we can count on one another, and that's all i need. i can't muster the words to tell him how proud of him i am, but i want the world to know that; hence the post. anyway, i'll be here to chat for another 2 hours. your comments will keep me entertained while i am melting in the heat watching my brother walk. i hope you have a great weekend! once again, congratulations to all graduates!!!! 🤘🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 tl;dr: just my congratulations to all graduates and expressing how proud i am of my brother for completing his bs degree.	0

how do i(28f) address these things that could be red flags before i get in too deep with him (34m)? been seeing this guy for about 2 months (usually just 1x/week). overall, there are *so* many things i like about him, and i'm definitely having feels. but...i've noticed some things that might be red flags that i want to address. i don't want to keep sinking time into this if these things will end up being deal breakers. **#1) i haven't noticed him say thank you.**..at all. not when i bought us froyo, not when the waitress refills our drinks, not when he forgot to get butter and i picked some up, not when i did all the dishes at his house after he made us food. generally, he is a fairly quiet and soft-spoken person, and he *seems* appreciative, but that seems like no excuse? i'm heading to his house wednesday after work to cook us both dinner. if i don't get a thank you for that, should i bring it up? what would i say? i just spent 4 years with someone who didn't appreciate me, so this is a major warning sign. **#2) it feels like there is just this barrier up with him.** i've never heard him be anything but content. i told him about some shitty things that happened to me and his responses were nice but a bit robotic? i'm not sure if this is a bad thing, i could totally see the benefit of someone who is just generally stable...i'm just worried this could be an issue in the future. i'm not sure how to get him to open up, or if this is him being open? this is the smallest of the red flags. **#3) we have been intimate 3 times now. each time, i am the one to initiate almost everything.** from kissing, to touching, to taking clothes off, etc. i have spent a good amount of time during foreplay paying attention to him (touching, oral, etc), but not once has he done the same for me. he just kisses me back, and just generally holds my body, but no touching, no oral. last time he did start the making out, i literally waited forever to see if he would. i even stuck his hand to my crotch when i was still partially clothed (sorry if tmi), and he only stayed there for like 10 secs? i texted him this the next day: " alright my dude. i was going to talk to you about this yesterday but my head had other plans. \[i had a migraine\]. you need to tell me what kind of stuff you like during intimacy. because i want to make you feel good and i'm kind of just guessing over here. not everyone is used to just laying that stuff out, but it just makes everything feel better ☺️. on my end, kissing you is like...the best thing ever. it's been ages since i've found someone i like to french kiss. you're also like 1000% my type looks wise, so that's definitely awesome too. but, once the fun newness of this wears off a bit, those things alone is totally not going to be enough to get me going. " he responded with: "well i've very much been having a good time so far, but i'll try to speak up more :) i can say the neck kissing thing you did last night felt especially good. i'll also add that in general i find you super sexy, and agree that communication is important in that aspect of a relationship as well :) " i have no idea how to address this if we are intimate again and nothing changes. i don't know if he is just inexperienced? or if he just prefers to be super submissive? or if he is just sexually selfish? **if anyone has suggestions for how to approach these items, please let me know!** if all 3 things don't change or show hope that this is not a trend, i will 100% break this off, and would like to tell him why. **tl;dr** 3 possible red flags after seeing each other 8 times. how can i communicate in a healthy way about what's bothering me?	0

what does it mean to be worthless? there's a quote in this book called " notes to myself" written by hugh prather, i'll paraphrase it but it's along the lines of, "i am holding this cat in my arms so it can sleep, what more is there." as in, what more *in this moment* is there? i've always loved that. it's my favorite book, i think it always will be. i'm here today because i am clinging to the need to not hurt anyone. i am told i shouldn't work...but i want to. i met and fell in love with my best friend at work. fast forward three years, he's still technically "married" and we're living with his dad. i believe this is my fault. my so told me he didn't think i should work. severe ptsd, major depression, bpd, panic disorder, i hallucinate, and i'm agoraphobic. we cannot afford to live on our own. he says he wants to be with me but spends all night after work on video games, and every weekend it's the same. i love him so much but i feel like a burden and his dad basically told me i was. today. i. do. not. want. to. live. not like this. i have been all over r/suicidebereavement to read how badly my actions could hurt people. in this haze, it matters less. i know you know what i mean. i am in therapy. i take the medications as prescribed. i'm 32f. i laugh a lot, i like to make other people laugh. i also happen to wish i'd never been born. i have a job interview on friday. wish me luck. maybe advice on anything? what keeps you going day to day? thanks for reading ❤️	1

how much money do you have saved / how old are you? i know this question is a little invasive but i just want to know if i'm falling behind or if i'm doing okay for my age. i'm 23 and i did have near $20,000 aud saved (approx $14,350 usd according to google) but i have a business which is not yet profiting and i usually only spend money that has come through the business but i recently invested a few thousand of my life savings into it. i also spent another few thousand recently for a big holiday in december so now my savings is only around $7,000 aud. i'm stressing because i feel like i'm putting a lot of time and money into my business that i could have put into a deposit on an apartment. where i live, for a one bedroom older apartment is around $650-700k and if my business doesn't start making me some money soon i will have literally nothing... 😟	0

so i went to the dentist today. i literally never wash my teeth (yes ew i know) and when me and my sister got there she was talkin mad shit about what the the dentist was gonna say, so we go in there and she gets checked up, no problems, and when the dentist starts looking at mine, he looks straight at my sister that washes her teeth religiously "well they're not any dirtier than yours so you're both fine" and the whole drive home she didn't even look at me 😂. pretty dumb story i know but i had to share it.	0

ptsd and everyone's "harsh truths" make me want to die after just turning 29 and being female.tldr: i explored all the radical ideologies online (like red pill, black pill, etc.) and i'm a 29 year female who thought she had her whole life ahead of her despite surviving complex trauma...and now i want to die because of...really misogynistic/youth-obsessed/nihilistic people and their enablers on the internet. and welcome to my truth i have accomplished typical milestones in my life and have people that love and care about me. i look fine--some people even say i'm beautiful/gorgeous (like it matters that much? 🙄) but i am also curious and i have been through complex trauma (including repeated sexual abuse/rape, car accidents, tragically losing my mother, public degradation and medical malpractice)...i know i'm resilient but i am so damn tired of surviving and trying to thrive and achieve my goals amongst abusive people in my everyday life and the vibrant community of abusers and their ignorant-enablers online (and yes. i dare say this on reddit) i am also aware that people my age are up against impossible odds in america (which everyone conveniently blames my generation for--before we were even old enough to hold positions of authority). if you don't know what i mean...read this: <url> meanwhile, so many men in my age group and younger are being "red pilled" and blaming all women for their problems (they say "feminism" but they punish average women for the mainstream culture) and the women are becoming desperate "pick-me's" who believe their value ends when they turn 23 years old. i know its not everyone, but its happened to men and women i care about as well as myself a little bit. and i want to die. i can already feel/predict the responses i will get to this post. i feel like i'm drowning in a sea of people who are so downtrodden, pessimistic and brainwashed that they think they're just being a "realist" when they're actually being excessively-insensitive and have the worst interpretation of reality (which makes them believe they are telling us all "harsh truths"). and don't get me started on the logicky-skeptic-y--science-is-absolute-truth-stuff. science gathers support and evidence--stop following it like its religious dogma. and i'm sorry but as a female, the time of 18-24 years old were the absolute worst years of my life, other than my academic life/graduating college. other than school, i was put down, raped and degraded repeatedly. it was hell. i lost mind. i lost my mother. if some red-pill neckbeard says that's "my prime", then please fucking kill me. my life has gotten better since then and i feel healthier than ever--i think i look better too, but fucking internet society and its self-deprecating-youth-obsession is leaking into the real world more and more and more i can't escape it. i want to die, but i don't want to attempt again (i survived suicide when i was 18). i keep asking for someone to kill me gently...but i really just want everyone to wake up to something better and stop being so obsessed with nihilism/procreation/youth/etc. but again, i can imagine the reddit comments now. i hope i'm wrong about that--but yes, please...kill me.	1

what to dohi, hope y'all are having a good weekend. i wanted to post to ask when it's okay to cut off a parent. i'm in my 20s and live with my mom. sometimes she is very rude and has anger issues. as a child i was abused mentally, physically and tortured in ways. i was asking my mom if she wanted anything from amazon as i found a hat knowing she wanted something nice. she was saying they have the exact same thing at dollarama etc or home hardware. i explained the quality is different and i even showed her. she tends to say "sure" and be rude. i explained i've been taught to question stuff like that unless i see evidence. i've brought this thing up many times because she tends to make up false claims and give false info about many things and i like to check if it's true. i was explaining it may be similar but they don't have that one and the ones online are higher quality. when she's proven wrong she was being rude and said get a job etc. also made up some b.s. i was a part time student and had to leave my job because the hours were getting in the way of classes at uni. i've worked contract jobs etc. since she was being rude i decided the tv i got recently that i let her use in the living room i would take back and put it in my room. i later heard her telling and then she threw my nice belt buckles, few of my clothes and my property and damaged some of my things. she can be extremely childish. she threatens to break my stuff sometimes and throws or damages my property, yells in the apartment to clearly get attention and i still have nightmares from things that have been done to me as a kid. i was wondering when it's okay to cut off family? if i should perhaps sleep outside in the winter. if something happens to me my sleeping outside and i pass away i've kind of accepted it. as a kid i used to try to sleep outside in the winter when i ran away, just to be able to get some sleep. i'm just wondering if it's okay to speak to her less or if i should just start sleeping outside and find storage for some of my things etc. i've already donated a bunch of clothes and other things last november in case i do move out i less things. any tips on what to do? perhaps i wasn't meant to be born lol. some days that i'm having a good day, either at uni or just in general it seems like she purposely says mean or rude things. sometimes she tries to start talking to me again and stuff. there are only some days which are good and i just wanted to be happy. i'm wondering now if there's even a point to living. perhaps if i'm not alive anymore it may be better. have a great weekend ✌️ positive vibes.	1

it's time for some friday night q's!!! 1. what do you have planned for the weekend? 2. what are you looking forward to? 3. what's is/are your personality flaw(s)? 4. house, townhouse or high-rise condo? 5. what did you have for dinner tonight? **op** 1. not a whole lot, not getting paid until the end of the month so lying low, relaxing and unpacking. 2. getting paid currently 😂 3. anxiety, temper, little patience 4. i'm torn between the high-rise and the townhouse tbh. love the views and the centralized location a high-rise offer, but man they aren't cheap. townhouse would also be nice, but need to have 2 car garage. i've seen too many times people in townhouses turn their garage in to a storage unit. 5. leftover chicken, pb&j, and some cheese-its	0

update from last post, lot has changed. having severe depression and suicidal thoughts, i decided i would change myself for the better. i decided to suppress and hide my feelings until they got better, i go out more often now, interact as much as possible with any stranger i can, i restored my humour i'm a class clown again my anxiety has gone down soo much that it's unbelievable at times. i only deal with negative emotions, thoughts and feelings in the night time when i'm all alone, i just sleep it off now, it's much easier. i don't feel stressed out as much anymore. don't know how i achieved this but i did. for anyone who believes that time wouldn't solve anything, time makes things easier as it goes on. maybe, me being too much of a pussy to end my life, was for my better. thank you to anyone who supported me previously 💜	1
posting a promise for $10,000 on reddit if an impossible thing happened and it was read nationally on the air. here is [the post](<url>) that made it on espn's dan lebatard show today. years ago, sioux falls had a big deal where we would try to get stugotz up here by giving him a key to the city, halftime show to him, a limo ride, golf outing, name the town stu falls for a day, etc. it's always been a running gag that he's a snake/slimeball that would never go through with it, and it faded off into the distance for awhile. so as a gag, i made the post (with intent to back it up) saying that i'm putting up $10,000 but subtracting $100 per day from the total until he comes here. while i quickly realized that the initial $10 per day would take 3 years to complete and changed it to $100 per day quickly, the one they read on the show was the $10 per day! you know how these (i'll do *x* until *y* posts go.... they take awhile to build momentum) i didn't expect the first day it would be found and read on the show live! now i'm hoping to be in communication to see what's to come next and how seriously i should start raising the remainder of the $10k should he head up here in the very near future. my gut said it was a stupid safe bet that the sub could enjoy, but now it could become a thing. which i would love and find a way to raise the money. tl;dr thought i was doing a funny gag post that would take awhile to be seen by a radio show, turns out they immediately saw it and it could cost me $9,000+ 😂	0

what's the meaning behind this? so, i (27) was for 4 months talking with a young lady (29) every free minute, straight up genuine conservations till in the night till one of us fell asleep. we had such a great time together even met each other to spend the weekend together hooked up etc. even agreed to meet again at this upcoming weekend because the weekend was so great. but then all of the sudden she tells me , she doesn't wanna have to do something with me anymore and stopped communication with me. literally from one moment to another, there was no build up or anything. i once asked her if we would be dating or is this considered something like that. i tried to communicate her like it was back in the day, but nothing she would occasionally just respond with an "i am sorry, i've got an headache". while she is online texting other people 😐. i don't understand woman at all. tl;dr: i don't understand woman and need your advice	0

i'm a 23/f dating a 25/m unable to deal with insecurities and stop overthinking so, we have been dating for 2 years now and this is the third year running, we're quite committed to each other. everything was well and good, until 6 months into the relationship i find out that he was flirting with another girl who had no idea that i existed. to shine more light on this, we are now in a long distance relationship as he finished college and had to go back. we do meet once in 2-3 months though. so yeah, when i found out, i was broken. i never had insecurties upto that point. we talked it out, and he told me i matter to him and he would change. also stressed on the fact that he didn't always flirt with her, it was about 2 or 3 times apparently 🤷‍♀️. i gave it another chance and i really saw him change. there were many, many tiny things like hiding his instagram story from me etc that i eventually found out later, and he made excuses for those and againnn i was like, ok. those small things just built up and idk if i'm wrong to still feel insecure. i just can't get the fact out of my head, that if he did it once then he can do it again. i'm trying my best. today, we had an argument about something and he just straight off told me that he regrets ruining his friendship with a particular friend for a 2 year relationship. in all honesty, the way they spoke, was never just friendly to me. i asked him to keep distance then, and he did. and today, i get to hear this. he told me, for him friends and relationships are equally important. he doesn't want to lose his friends, neither does he want to lose me. am i wrong to still feel insecure? am i the one overthinking for no reason?	0

i(22f) drunk called my bf(23m) of 2 years yesterday and i feel so embarassed i am a lightweight. so normally i just go for 1-2 beers. but yesterday was just so fun and i got really drunk. today i woke up and saw my phone and i found out i called him 2 times yesterday. we talked almost for like 20 mins. the only thing i remember is me saying i love you a lot... like in every language i know and saying i just wanna marry you, you are so perfect blah blah.... he didnt freak out cuz we talk about marriage a lot and we r going to move in soon... but im just so embarrased. i have never done something like this and he didnt bring it up today but later when we call i think i gotta ask him about how i was. has anyone had something like this? 😂 tl;dr: i drunk called my bf and be a little too much affectionate. and i feel so embarassed now. am i overthinking this? or should i stop drinking alcohol	0

guys i did a big oopsie we were playing truth or dare at my friend's house and i got asked out of the people here who would you kiss. i didn't want to say so i used my one opt out on that question and the game went on. later, after the game ended, my crush brought me to the corner of the pool away from everyone. she asked me the same question from before. i didn't want to seem desperate or obsessed with her so i said someone else who was at the party. she just said "oh cause if it was me i would've done something" and that's when i knew i did a big oopsie. 🤡	0

single this valentines? me too, here is how you can make someone's day better (for free). hey! i am going to be single this valentines (like most people on this sub 💀) but just because you're single this valentine's, you can still make someone's day **for free** shoot someone a dm with a nice compliment, ask someone if they want to play a game or even drop a like (and a share) on someone's youtube video. anything can make someone, even yourself happy. millions are doing the same as what i am saying (likely right now!). so why don't you? doesn't cost a dime.	0

embalm or, not to i made an appt last wed for a free counseling session, at a trauma and grief based place for this am. last night, i had a meltdown and finally bought the formaldehyde that's been sitting in my cart... i wasn't going to go to the appt. i had planned to box things and leave notes etc till my package arrived in 8-10 biz days. but my cat actually woke me- by standing on top of my aquarium peering in thru the plexi glass window top, and then looking at me. i kid you not, if you knew how old she was and her demeaner you'd know how out of sorts it really was. it was like she was saying, who's going so take care of us? (not look ma i want a snack-she's a sweetie). of course i didn't look at it like this at the time, she knocked something over and i was in mid lucid dream when she woke me😑. i really love my pets though and they are all i really have. and they don't deserve to be abandoned. i myself know that feeling too well. so i do feel really guilty every time i want to give up. either way, i made it to my appt bc i thought why the hell not. i'm awake and my pets rn are kinda irritating me. 🤷🏼‍♀️ no expectations of being helped even the slightest. after 4 long years of begging for guidance from anyone who will listen to me. to the point that i'm now honestly so much worse bc i've been so isolated and in so much pain. but today i finally got covered by a grant for therapy at this place. i showed up. and it was really hard to. but i'm really glad i did. bc someone finally saw my worth today and i have to say, i'm feeling a little better.	1
my mother told me she will not comfort me. she will not hold me, she will not stand close to me, she will not say warm words. she told me tonight. she is all i have. i have no one else and all i need--i *need*, i need! fuck!--is comfort. some goddamn fucking comfort. i have no one else. i have no one. i looked at myself straight-on in the mirror tonight. what looked back was determination. fucking determination. i am fucking determined to end this. i will no longer fight for a life i will never live. when i have said, "i am done, i am through," in the past, it has been a cry for help, a red flag. this time, i don't give a fuck if you or anyone else believes me because i am flying high and hyper-focused. this shit ends. i am going to go to bed now so i can spend tomorrow planning. this is like setting up a wedding 🎉--that much excitement and strategic planning with half of the emotions to deal with, a hundredth of the time, but two hundred times cheaper! and my certificate will be written in stone (much classier). fuck everyone. fuck every single person that has ever existed and that will ever exist. i don't give a damn. drown in the rising tides. good. fucking. riddance.	1

did i ruin my sisters internship? so i [21 f] emailed someone who works at the place that my older step sister [26 f] will be interning at asking if it was possible for her to get a week off because my parents are surprising her with a trip but wasn't sure when to book it and we didn't want to get in the way of the internship and the lady responded and asked for my sisters name. i told my sister about it and she freaked out on me. saying that they're gonna drop her from the internship. but this is what i said "to whom it may concern, my step sister recently got news of an internship with (insert company) and my family wanted to surprise her with a trip and we were wondering if she could possibly take a week off? any information helps!" the lady responded asking for her name and i gave it to them and also said "i would also like to clarify if taking time off during an internship is not possible we will plan the trip for another time. she's super excited to work with you and we wanted to celebrate her success!" now i'm crying freaking out that i just ruined her whole year 😞😞 tl;dr: i contacted someone my sister is going to intern for asking if she gets time off for a surprise trip we're planning and my sister yelled at me saying i ruined her internship	0

how do i (m22) text a girl (f20) so i just finished up hanging out with a group of friends, in that group is said girl. i texted her after we got home and left an appropriate amount of time between us all parting ways (around an hour) before texting her. she just started film college so i sent "i hope your taking a signature writing class because i need your before your famous 🤣🤣" to which she replied "your too kind sir" with no emoji... we get along well in person good banter and whatnot but i just am horrible at interpreting text responses is this good? bad? neutral? how do i gauge things from her responses in the future? tldr; texted a girl, and i have no idea how texting girls works	0
i turn 27 in a few minutes. i'm in my room drinking alone on a saturday and i'm having suicidal thoughts again for the first time in nearly 10 years.i have supportive friends and family - hell, i have a group of friends upstairs right now at this very moment hanging out and having a good time. but here i am, alone in my room drinking straight vodka with the lights off because i simultaneously don't want to be sober, but also hate my body too much to afford it some form of sweetened mixer. i feel inexorably isolated from every person i interact with. as if i can't open up and be myself near any living person. i have a stable job in a relatively cutting edge field that pays well. one where i've been promoted consistently and feel appreciated for my efforts - but i feel no satisfaction from my work whatsoever. there isn't a single source of motivation in my life that feels worthwhile. i've sought therapy for things in my past but i feel as if i just tell these people what i think they want to hear. i feel disgusting when i have to rely on other people for anything, and as a result - here i am, wanting desperately to reach out to someone i know, but feeling paralyzed and unable to. i was given an inheritance when my grandpa passed in the form of a .308 bolt action rifle. over the past few weeks i withdrew all $25k dollars from my retirement fund, on top of everything in my checking account. right now nothing feels more compelling than to sober up, write an informal letter distributing my belongings and money between the people i know, exit my house, load the rifle into my trunk, drive somewhere far out into the woods - and then walk out into a field and end it all. i don't want my death to inconvenience the people around me. i don't want my brains to stain my car, so someone can take it and use it in my place. ... i know i'm not going to do any of this. i have responsibilities. but those things don't change the desires to do it, or this overbearing feeling of isolation. 1 minute until i become tardy for joining the 27 club. happy birthday to me. 🎉	1

parents..show your kids that you actually appreciate them, their efforts i'm not proud of my relationships with guys. for all my adult life, although i vehemently denied it, i could not be on my own. i had to be someone's girl, i based my identity on being attached to someone. it didn't help that all my friends were in stable relationships & settling down while for one reason or another, i was going through break up after break up. i was lonely, felt worthless. in these 'situationships' i ended up doing the most, my people-pleasing game was at its best! and in the process i was killing myself. ff to therapy, and i realized what i always knew but didn't want to admit. i had major daddy issues. no, he wasn't absent. on the contrary, i was raised by a single dad for almost 10yrs (13-22). during that time, in spite of being an a-student, good daughter, never did i feel appreciated for being that. my siblings were the complete opposite in some aspects but he seemed to be tougher on me & i suppose at a subconscious level i resented him for that. interestingly he'd brag about me in my absence and that drove me mad! if only he'd voiced some of this praise for me to me, i doubt i'd have been looking for 'acceptance' from every tom, dick & harry 😞 anyway it's taken me almost 20yrs to accept that i am enough on my own* i'm not yet a parent but i promise to let my children know their worth and pay them on the shoulder when they've earned it 😌	0

just found out there's actually a syndrome that explains stans💀💀 "celebrity worship syndrome (cws) is an obsessive addictive disorder in which a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebrity's personal and professional life. psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over film, television, sport and pop stars, the only common factor between them is that they are all figures in the public eye. this is commonly found on sites such as facebook, twitter and instagram."	0
just want to say one last goodbye...i will kill myself tomorrow. no chance for me to live on my life. this is punishment, an honorable punishment, for living in this cruel world. just want to say, this is my final decision. i want to say thank you for trying to help me, but i feel like my life is at the end of the line. i can't do this anymore. you're better off without me, anyway... so, i want to say goodbye. goodbye, everyone... 👋😔	1

lost my dragon today i was in a hurry this morning and i didn't fully close my bearded dragon's terrarium. when i got home from work, i noticed she was gone. i've looked everywhere-she's little, only 6 months old. i can't hear her moving anywhere! she's had, at the least, 8 hours to run around. she could be anywhere!! i put some squash out in a dish for her. i hope she comes back. i've been crying at my stupidity for the last hour. i can't find her, i can't see her, i can't hear her. 😢😢 i'm terrified. so, raistlin, if you read this, or if you can hear my cries, please come back! i miss you!	0
i got my first job, but it's a bittersweet feeling i'm in my last year of high school, and i just got my first job at my local library! it's 2 to 3 days a week, and the hours are good. i applied last june, i didn't know it was going to take so long! anyway, i'm excited. i'm just going to miss visiting my family in the summer. usually we go for a month to visit my grandparents, but i can't exactly do that anymore. i didn't go last summer as i panicked about not having a job, so i tried to get one. i failed, and i wasted a summer. that's a big regret of mine, i didn't realise how much i would miss my family. plus, i'm going to university next year, so i'll probably never get to do that again. i realised too late how precious that time was, and i feel very sad about screwing up one of my last chances. anyway, i'm still glad i got the job. it's just hard not seeing my family for so long, and knowing i won't get to for a while more. growing up in general is painful, honestly. i've had a lot of family and friends die, so i guess it's always in the back of my mind that my time with them is limited. they aren't in great health and they're getting old, and i'm tired of seeing my family die of poor health. geez, writing this out is making me tear up! i've kept this inside of me for a while. high school has been rough, some really bad stuff has happened, and going to visit my family was like a reset button on all my stress. i miss them, i don't want them to die, and i'm honestly not ready to grow up and deal with being on my own yet. i also haven't seen my other side of the family in 5 years, so i miss them all the time as well. i email, but it's not the same. this also got me thinking about vacation time in full time jobs. 2 weeks vacation seems like so little. what if your family is scattered across the country or even the world? 2 weeks every year isn't enough to visit everyone. i should move to europe, 4 weeks is much better. thanks for reading, this got darker than expected near the end, but it feels good to write it out. i think i'll email my gran tonight 🙂.	0
how to handle anything at all/help parents understand what depression is?so i've been in bed for about 6 days now, have just kind've completely checked out at this point. when i get like this my parents try flipping between compassion and weird motivational speak, but the condescension and animosity they line their phrases with is kind've mind-blowing to be honest. i made the mistake of buying into that bullshit spiel about reaching out™️™️™️ and telling someone™️™️™️™️ ™️(because my life is so fucking sacred™️™️™️™️™️™️) by asking my mom if i could see someone asap i get that she and my father are frustrated, i've been through over a half dozen therapists and tried at least a dozen different medications at this point, and i'm a pretty fucking pathetic kid for someone to produce but her response just really sucked. she said there was no use trying any medication or therapy at this point because up till now it hasn't worked, so here on out it's "up to me" whether i live life or not i dont think they're privy to my constant suicidal ideations, but this was really just about the dumbest thing i've heard yet. at least they used to lace their bullshit motivational phrases with less repugnancy "some therapists/meds just aren't a good fit!!" "gotta keep trying!!!!" the notion that i just cherish not having the motivation to shower or leave my bed is frankly the most backwards thing i've heard from them, and really goes to show how little regard they seem to have for mental illness as a whole i would fucking looooooooove to just plaster on a big fucking smile and actually mean it for once, get up in the morning, every morning, and just manage to do something billions of other people seem to flawlessly manage. i would absolutely love this. they flat out said they "[didn't] think i liked to work which is why i was avoiding school" (???) christ so basically there is no more "reaching out" because they're tired of dealing with me. believe me i get it. i'm just grateful no one can say i didnt try. considering they dont seem to be interested in continuing to pursue psychotherapy, because, y'know, we've totally done literally everything medicine has to offer, and at this point i just gotta get my game face on!!! :))))) i get that they're fucking tuckered out, i sure as hell am. but i feel like this at the very least prevents them from license to grieve. because i really do not know what else to do at this point. i would love to be just dandy, i would. but how the fuck? sorry if you've read this far, i assure you that it was a massive waste of your time	1

older woman [65f] at my [30f] job is being catfished/scammed hope it's ok i post this here! i went to /needadvice but it said no relationship questions! wasn't sure if this applied. i work with this older woman at my job who i heard recently had put in her two weeks notice because she was getting remarried (she's widowed) and moving to texas (far from where we are). i thought, good for her. she's kind of a weird one but always nice and a hard worker. i finally had the chance to talk to her about it today. she told me she met this guy on facebook, they talked, exchanged pictures and fell in love. but she is all worried and freaking out because apparently, he has been working some job (?) in syria (??!!) for the past year or so and he's "stuck" there. she said he was paid for the work ahead of time for the full amount ($300,000 🙄) and since him and his "co workers" finished the job earlier than expected, they have to pay back $30,000. all of his co workers managed this except him. what even is this? an american working in syria? there isn't even an american embassy there anymore i don't think. now his money is in his bank in the us and can't get to it. no family on his account, bank won't work with him, many other bullshit excuses she told me. she's never met him, talks to his "son" but has never talked to him. i'm waiting for her to tell me she gets a "check" from a family member of his, cashes it at her bank and then wires it to him, etc etc that whole scam. it's so obvious she's getting catfished and about to get scammed. she's an older lady, she's probably never heard of this scam or even heard of catfishing. she's all alone (family in a different state) and widowed. my problem is apparently a few people at my work know. i'm one of the last to find out. i can't just sit by and let this poor woman quit her job and potentially get severely scammed and heart broken. everyone i talked to says, "it's none of my business, she won't listen." what should i do? just stay out of it? tl;dr - old lady at my job is getting catfished and possibly scammed, is in the process of quitting her job and moving, no one wants to intervene. what should i do?	0

i can't live with having done thisok trying to make this as brief as possible: mental breakdown around january last year. went from an extremely heavy and skinny smoker who only ate garbage to a gym rat. eating, eating, eating, 4000 calories of the healthiest food per day, becoming strong and healthy. always hitting the gym. however: i get filled with regrets because the contrast is so huge. i feel like i'm about to die. also get so fucking angry at myself and feel like the biggest failure ever. i mean... who smokes!? who neglects his health!? only losers do that. self-esteem below zero. suicidal thoughts. extremely depressed. i contact my ex to talk about it. look up to her because she's 8 years older. i'm 28, she's 36. i start it off on the wrong foot with extremely negative texts like calling life pointless bullshit (fucking toxic behavior of me) she gets angry and i feel like i have to explain myself. she constantly says something i want to reply to and then blocks me so i keep making new accounts. one time she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so i make a new account one last time to reply with 'but i did change'... then she explodes. writes a message to hurt me as much as possible and says she will never reply again. says shit like 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... saying that to me in my situation is pure poison for my brain. it's black on white and becomes engrained in my brain. everything went wrong here. how i started it off with those negative texts and then tried to save it by continuing to make new accounts while my ex just wanted me to leave her alone. my ex also being unempethatic as fuck which makes me want to explain myself even more. her ending it in that horribly cruel last message... after that it keeps repeating in my head every single minute of the day. i'm so frustrated and sad that she said that to me because it completely ruins my mental health and makes me feel hopeless while she doesn't know the full story. the only thing that made me feel proud of myself is how i've turned my life around, but that feels completely in vain after her last message. i can't cope with it and constantly write messages and delete them again only to write them again everyday explaining myself and apologizing. telling her i know it was bad what i did. she never replies. after like 4 months of doing that shit she gets rid of her instagram 😓 i wrote a last extremely personal e-mail to her work, but she left that company so it got forwarded to her co-workers. holy shit. conclusion: i've turned into a stalker. should i kill myself? i can't live with the embarrassment and shame... it's also not something i did in the heat of the moment. i kept contacting her day after day. it's a pattern. i'm just a fucked up person.	1

blamed by familymy family has lost my sister in law to suicide. her and my brother were best friends since they were young (known each other for 10+ years) as they grew older they became a couple and recently had a child who just turned 1. they were inseparable. they lived together and then they came to live with me for awhile. we became close and i was used to seeing them together everyday. she was someone who was always smiling, and she loved her son and my brother very much. recently she had moved out and i guess something happened between them where they were no longer together. my brother had been exposed to someone with covid-19 and so we were in quarantine for 2 weeks. he didn't go over to her house because he didn't want to get her or their son sick. she made a post about how "she doesn't know how fathers can chose not to see their kids". from there it went all downhill. i knew they weren't together by the post she would share on fb. i wasn't sure what the reason was, i still don't. however, within the last 2-3 days before her suicide she was acting very weird, she came at 12am holding their son and she could barely stand. the next day her mom took her son from her because i'm guessing she noticed something was not right with her. from there she came back to our house she had crashed her car she said due to someone chasing her. she said she was fine but her bumper was off. she left again she came back and had someone(not sure who yet)?bring her to steal my brothers car that night and crashed it because the front light was broken. she said she didn't steal the car when we asked but she showed up in the car. she said she didn't remember doing that. me and my mom sat her down and asked her what was wrong, and that she could tell us anything. she told us she was fine. we made her stay the night and get some sleep in the morning she put sugar in all the cars tanks and other parts of the car at my house, she beat the cars with sticks, she tried to climb into the window where my brother was. she started hitting him, broke his necklace, grabbed his things and started to destroy them they were arguing and it got physical. i broke them up. i went and grabbed my mom and she came out and made sure everything was ok and said this can't continue to happen. my brother called her sister to tell her what my sis in law was doing, but she said "it's all your fault" and they hung up. i called my dad and told him he went to look for her and he found her on the side of the street she had left her car parked with windows down and her keys on the street. she didn't know what she was doing. he brought her to her moms thinking that she would be safe with them, she had grabbed her son and fell with him. her parents and siblings were there so he left her there with them. we found out she went walking and committed suicide by jumping off the bridge. her brother and sister had followed her in their car but she jumped off the bridge. now they are blaming my brother and saying that he can't go to the funeral or have his son back and that they never want to see us again. they have also been telling people that it was my brothers fault. i just don't know what to do, or what to say to them. we all miss her too. we are heartbroken. we loved her. our life will never be the same. i play the last moments with her over and over in my head thinking what i shouldn't done. but i never expected this to ever happen. looking for some advise or opinion. i can literally feel the pain in my chest 😢	1
i hate driving, period it stresses me out so much. im worried about pissing other people off and i try to drive cautiously. just today, i was driving my mom's truck (thing is really huge) and almost drove out infront of a car, which the driver of it sent me a death glare. i wanted to crawl under the dashboard and hide cus i felt like an asshole. thanks for coming to my ted talk 💅	0

shaving asshole and applying dettol !!!warning!!! this will be long, graphic and somewhat disgusting let me start off by saying that the actual shaving happened last week. the pain came thursday. even more pain came yesterday. and then even more today. okay, so i shave under my arms and my pubes every week (usually thursdays) and occasionally, my asshole. i loved shaving when my hair started growing. how stupid i was. i'm indian. turned out to become quite hairy it felt cool and i liked the "clean feeling" i felt after removing it. not saying that if you keep your hair that you're dirty, just saying i feel clean when i remove mine. was a hairless one before puberty, ended up being very hairy after puberty. i started with my balls and pubic bones, then my underarms. it felt cool. tried my back because i knew i had there but it was very little, still is thankfully. tried my chest too but both my back and chest itched so never again. eventually, i got to shaving my ass cheeks. big mistake as they're hairy af right now and itch incredibly when i shave them. so now they only get shaved 1-2 a year. okay so i eventually i found my way to my asshole and found i had hair there. so what did i do? i shaved it. and i kept shaving it. until an incident last year. i shaved my asshole and wore a completely new jockey (cherokee brand). 2 days later (saturday morning) it felt like jam between my ass cheeks. thought it was sweat because it was hot. the jam-like feeling intensifies over the next few hours so i thought i'd go wipe my ass. i pull down my pants get the smell of shit and thought my ass was leaking. i wipe and there's what looks like brown sweat. odd. wipe a few more times. same thing. tried to shit, nothing came out. odd. i decide to ignore it and go back to whatever i was doing. few hours later, my asshole is paining and that jam feeling is there again. go wipe again. brown sweat with little dots of blood. now i start to panic. wiped more until the "sweat" was gone. decided to put dettol on (i didn't want an asshole infection). my asshole burned. suffered through it. wasn't that bad. put some more on until it stops burning. that helped. 2 days later it was better. figured i probably cut it open somewhere down there when i was shaving. shaved that week again. my asshole was fine. shaved the next week after that and it happens again and i was wearing my cherokee jockey again. no biggie, i know how to fix it. my hypothesis is that the jockey causes it. they're new and tight, especially around my ass (i squat) the next thursday comes, i decide to test my hypothesis. it happens again. i conclude it's the cherokee jockey and don't wear it again after shaving fast forward a bunch of weeks. the jam feeling and blood happens again, but i'm so wearing my cherokee jockey. it's a lot worse and also itching as my butt cheeks rub against each other. then it hits me. it's my ass hair growing back thicker and scratching my asshole open. dettol again. it hurt more and stung for a while but problem solved. decide to start shaving one side of the asshole each week and alternate sides every week. it works. no problem. fast forward to last week thursday i'm shaving. i shave one side of my asshole. then the other. i realise what i did, but figure it's no biggie, bit of dettol and everything will be fine, right? wrong so fucking incredibly wrong friday goes by no problem. saturday, no problem. sunday, no problem. whole week, no problem. until thursday i feel the jam feeling again in between my cheeks. i go wipe. huh, the smell's not so strong this time. i'm glad. but the "sweat" is black this time. like really black. "dafuq" is the only thing i can think. wipe more until black "sweat" is gone (i really dunno what it is). it happens again later and it starts hurting. but very little. i shower and it's fine after that, but i didn't shave my asshole because it's sore. friday, i'm perfectly fine. saturday i wake up. jam between my ass cheeks. lots of it. i hate it. go wipe. some blood spots but not bad. after the black sweat and blood spots are gone, i see green. it looks like mucous. like that very light, milky green mucous when you have a cold/flu "what. the. fuck" is all i can think. i decide to put on dettol. it burns like hell but i power through it. it happens a few times throughout the day but it's getting worse. the "sweat", the pain. i shower and figure that there cheeks are either scratching each other open when they rub against each other or scratching open themselves by the hair being pressed against the cheek. i decide i have to shave one side so that it can heal. i decided to shave the left, because it hurts more. crouching down and crying while there's warm water running over me and burning my asshole. all i'm thinking is that i could probably use the fucking sun as a fucking ice block from the way it's burning. i take some soap and wipe my asshole. i notice the sweat on my hands and something came off that felt like skin. wiped more with soap on my hand and more came off. i realised it was dead skin. of course. there must be dead skin there. proceed to pull all the dead skin off. some of it was still attached to my cheeks and asshole but it didn't hurt pulling it off, but i could still feel it. i pull off the last and look at it. it's greyish. i think of how i pulled it off. dead skin won't be felt like that if you pull it off. then it hits me. it was fucking new skin growing ugh. it'll be fine. i painfully shave the hair off the left side of my asshole. after the shower, i feel better and put toilet paper in my ass in case the "sweat" starts again. i'm up for a few hours. there's no sweat at all and most of all, the pain is dissipating. i go sleep. i wake up this morning, there's jammy sweat. fuck. but no pain. yaaaay. i get up to go wipe it. what the fuck. i can barely stand. it hurts so fucking bad. the pain radiating from my asshole to the highest curve of my asshole. i limp to the bathroom. no one notices my pain. good. don't want to answer questions. i wipe. lots of sweat. more milky green mucous. no blood though. apply dettol. it burns, more than before. so much so i sat in the toilet for 10 minutes. but it stops and i go on with my day, occasionally wiping and applying dettol. come 6 o'clock. it's burning and paining like hell. decide to take pictures of it coz i need to see if it's infected. the most difficult thing ever. dunno how girls manage to take ass pics. while i'm in all sorts of positions taking pics of my raw, open asshole, i start to feel a shit coming. fuck. i get up to stop. too late, need to shit. i sit down on the toilet and take one. i clean up with water as one does. it pains a lot. okay, now i've seen my asshole is open so i definitely need to use dettol. and since i know how bad it is and where it's open, i can put on properly. worst mistake i put on the dettol. it burns like hell. i let out a yell. luckily everyone is inside at the front of the house. i'm panting. i start to cry. my asshole keeps burning more and more instead of less and less. crying and panicking, i pour a jug of cold water and wash the dettol off my ass. wait a few seconds. burning dissipates after a minute or so. good. i stand up. fffffffffuck!!!!!! even more pain. i figure i should put more dettol on too since i didn't get everything properly the first time. big mistake. even worse than what happened a few minutes before. i'm crying in pain and the cold water isn't helping anymore. after idk how long, the pain stops. i get off the toilet, pain returns. it takes me a long time of standing up and sitting down to build up a tolerance to the pain, but i'm eventually standing with no pain i take fuck load toilet paper, put it between my cheeks as a barrier and wash my hands and leave. i see it"s 7. i'd been there for a whole hour i can't walk properly or sit on my asshole now. my grandmother asks me something, i can't hear. i ask her to repeat."when's college starting? your brothers start school tomorrow" "😨" is the only thing i can use to describe my face and thoughts. my college starts *tomorrow*. i've been on my first semester holiday for the last 6 weeks. if this pains tomorrow morning still, no way i'd be able to survive at college. it's a 15 minute walk from my house to my campus. so 30 minutes back and forth plus moving between classes. my asshole would never live to see another day. so now i'm here, panicking because i might have an infected asshole and snyone who's missed a whole day of it and business classes can tell you, it's almost impossible to catch up anytime soon. and i have to get up in 3 hours. fuck me right? tldr: shaved my asshole, regrowing hair scratched my asshole open. have spontaneous sweat and mucous appearing in my asshole and i'm in a fuckton of pain also, i'm adding the pictures of my asshole and the toilet paper with blood, "sweat" and mucous in the comments for those who *think* they're brave. and for the potential doctors seeing this post. edit: i stopped putting dettol on guys and i've been to the doc. got an antibiotics ointment and tablets. my asshole will make a recovery. thanks for the advice everyone. i woke up with a relatively painless asshole this morning but i missed college. suppose i'll just read my work this week. oh and also shaving that one side helped. even the doctor agreed. if you're wondering, yes he was trying not to laugh. the mucous thing was green pus. have a picture of it too but haven't uploaded that yet. the "sweat" isn't appearing anymore too. for some reason, my comments aren't appearing where i did post the pics. so i'll post it here and hopefully this edit appears [nsfw](<url>)	0

being too rough [nsfw] so this happened a few years ago now. i had a new girlfriend and we were doing laundry one day. i don't remember how, but that turned into making out and then rough sex on the basement floor. i of course used a trusty trojan™️ condom, because i was new to the sex thing and didn't know shit about condoms so i just picked the one i knew from commercials. anyway, we went at it, and it was became really primal and animalistic. she ended up with a bunch of bruises and i with scratch and bite marks. near the end, as i started picking up, something felt different; better. i finished with the strongest orgasm of my life and my girlfriend shrieked and shuddered. it was great. she muttered "holy shit why was that so good", and as i pulled out i saw why. the goddamn piece of shit condom had snapped, rolled back up, and basically turned into a cock ring. i had just had an intense orgasm inside my girlfriend who's not on birth control. naturally we both freak out and immediately get dressed and hit the corner drug store. the pharmacist is an old guy who immediately gets this look of judgement on his face when we tell him we need plan b, and he begrudgingly hands us a pamphlet and explains how to take the pill and its effect. we're standing there, sweaty, hastily dressed and visibly stressed, with my girlfriend hiding behind me, and he asks us when the "incident" happened as if he didn't already know the answer. he says since it just happened a few minutes ago there's nothing to worry about and that it would almost definitely work. so we go home, she takes the pills, and snuggle on the couch for a couple hours as she occasionally smacks me upside the head. nothing became of it, thankfully, but for years afterwards my girlfriend was paranoid during sex. she only wanted to do oral stuff for a while, and the first few times we had sex afterwards she stopped so we could make sure the condom was still there. we ended up breaking another trojan a few years later, though that was noticed, so we stopped. have since used various other condom brands and haven't had any except trojan break. note: both times they were the "ultra thin spermicidal lube" condoms. have used other "ultra thin" brands as well without issue. switched mainly to regular condoms after so we could keep doing the rough stuff with less worry. **tl;dr** had rough laundry room sex with the gf who wasn't on birth control, condom broke, she had to take plan b, was paranoid about sex for years after	0
i wanna fuckin die 😳😓🤣🤘🏽🤩😌 now	1
😕honestly, i'll be up front and say i don't have the balls to kill myself (plus i've made a promise not to) but it gets harder and harder to keep the promise. walking my dogs, my thoughts go to "tie them up to a tree, run in front of a car", or lock my bedroom door and leave a note for my parents to call the coroner and not enter the room, or my personal go to of visualization of me running face first into a plate glass window and hoping for the worst. lately though, the thoughts have become more like how far is it from the attic window to the ground/driveway/yard and how my climbing rope is all static so that'd break my neck with ease, right? my anxiety is through the roof, my depression is thicker than a san francisco fog. i've been looking for jobs and valuing myself accordingly but can't land anything beyond less than 10/hr. i look at my ex who, in the last couple months, has become happier, more effervescent and i'm really fucking happy for her, but i wasted 2 years of her life and made her miserable. i make everyone around me miserable or push them away. life genuinely feels like it's not worth trying anymore because whatever i do, others become happier because of me but i just get sadder and more depressed. currently i'm curled up in my closet, wiping away tears that aren't fully formed and hoping that i can mellow out. i genuinely don't wanna keep doing this routine anymore of try try try and just get ignored. i openly talk about my suicidal thoughts to keep myself in check. if others know where my head is at, then it's harder to get away wth. being alone is nice, but my thoughts take over and push me to the brink. i've been at this brink for so long that the idea of dieing isn't scary to me anymore. it looks less like something to fear and more like a weight that could be lifted from my shoulders. i give no shits how others feel if i were to do it. frankly, if you gave a fuck then why haven't people tried to be there for me? huh fuck, i hate myself.	1

well, i'm tryingmy father left my house long time ago, he tried to harm my mom so she left him. i'm proud of her. i had a step-father and he left us to. i'm not sad about it, i didn't actually accept him, i disliked him so i guess it's ok. but lately, my sister's anorexya and 2 of my mom's friends got cancer, i feel like i can't handle it anymore. i wanted to live a long and good life, studying forest auxiliary (google translate) and wanting to become a firefighter to help people, but i feel like i can't help myself anymore. i wanted to be productive all my live, not because me, i used to like live, but my firts goal was my family hapinness. now it looks like an imposible goal, and my life looks usseless, as i can't keep anything up. i lost contact to good friends, the only one who i've talked to is a computer freak (like i used to be), but he does not care about my personal issues. i feel so ashamed of myself. i want to be strong, i want to be the pilar that holds my family togheter, i want to help other people, but i just can't help myself. i won't ever kill myself because it would be 2 hard for my mom and aunt, but i'm losing hope so quickly, i just want to become invisible or something like that. it's so hard. i'm sorry for the long post, and sorry for my bad english. i used to care about my mistakes and so but actually i just care about my sister and my mother. sorry if i've wittren some misscence words, but i'm drunk and hopeless. listening to rock songs so i can get some hope. just sorry for wasting your time and wanted to apologyze. hope to see you soon. thaank you 💔. edit: actually i'd like to die with something like an overdose, so my family believes that it was my fault, not theirs. i was just a piece of shit, and i was so stupid. if nobody can cheer me up, i hope somebody can give me advice with how to kill myself and look like and accident. i wan't to suffer with my death, i wan't to feel my last feelings.	1

i quit i absolutely hate myself. people around me just seem to hate me. i've been fighting anxiety depression and borderline personality disorder for 3 years. i've not had a stable improvement ever. there's nothing more i can do to improve myself. i've tried everything. and now i've got ibs which stops me from going out and enjoying and relaxing. all i can do is stay in my room and rot. i can't take it anymore. my room is 11 floors up. there's no grill on the window. i can be free . finally be free. bye world. fuck you🖕	1

i locked my keys and my crushes phone in my car last night... so i was at a grad party and having a good conversation with the girl i'm into when she said her phone was dying. i offered for her to charge it in my car because my cigarette lighter ports don't turn off with my car so my charger is always on. we go out and we're having a good time messing with each other and everything is good. it's like 9:30 out at this point and it's already pretty dark. i had to put down my keys so i could find my charger and still hold my flashlight. then, when i got up, i was too distracted (read: stupid) to grab my keys. we went back to the party and talked for a couple more hours before her and her friend decided they wanted to leave. that's when i realized that my keys were locked in my car. i had to call and wake up my mom to have her come to the party to get my spare key so i could unlock the door. but we just ended up sitting in her friend's car and all talking some more, it was alright. embarrassing, but alright. still got that snap tho 🤷🏻‍♂️	0

i'm doing the best i can.forgive my grammar. i'm doing the best i can right now, but i have this urge to splattered my brains out on a clean white wall. life for me has lost all of it's charm and luster and only because my family needs i haven't done so. i think the scene would be beautiful, poetic even, but alas i can't bring myself to end it all. i couldn't put my parents through that. unfortunately it means i have to be alive a little while longer. 😔 , best wishes me.	1
i did it i told my parents about my anxiety and how i wanted to see a therapist. they said i could see one after exams have ended, as they don't want anything to interfere with them. i'm so happy. it was difficult, but maybe now i'll get diagnosed and given medication, and have someone to talk to. ❤️	0

i'm done so,today may be my last day on this filthy earth. earlier today i was quite depressed after finding out my local courthouse didnt do their job in regards to paperwork i filed in connection with a judgement i have against a man in california.the defendant/judgement debtor in this case defrauded me out of my last $750 in dec 2017.he's a 74 yr old white male who poses as a paralegal then when he has your money he stops answering your phone calls & claims he's in the hospital.he has at least 7 judgements in california totalling millions of dollars.he spent 3 years in federal prison & 3 years probation in california for securities fraud back in the 80s.this man is still using los angeles craigslist to defraud people today.however he is smart enough to go after poor desperate people that can't or wont sue him. i got a judgement against him back in january.i spelled his last name wrong.i've been trying for months to get the judge in my case to amend the judgement but he just doesnt give a 💩.i tried five times in july to serve this guy with an orap & subpoena for documents but beverly hills police dept would not breach the security of his luxury apartment to serve my legal paperwork.i blew \~$100 in july on process servers & civil sheriff service alone.the whole time......he's sitting in his small luxury apt in beverly hills earing bon bons from money he stole from poor people.....& laughing at me.i guess i may never get my money back from this 74 yr old con artist.there is no justice in this world.😔 after that disappointment earlier today,i decided to do some shopping at wal-mart.out of the blue some security guard comes up to me,very politely,to tell me that my stockings are slightly see through.he specifically said "sorry this is a family friendly store".he tried to be respectful but i was totally destroyed inside emotionally.i have a limited amount of clothing.i'm on the edge of homelessness myself.i go to community college & my financial aid is all the money i have & it doesnt go far at all.i asked him if i could at least pay for my groceries.......he allowed me that.i'm a 30 yr old black/arab woman.so this young security guard very politely forces me to the front to pay for my few items.then he forces some cashier to leave a line of people just to ring me up.then he stands there........where some people had to have seen......& watches me to make sure i leave.i'm a theater major so i have a lot of black stockings.some are opaque & some are crosshatching patterned but they are all black.i had no idea that i was in violation of any dress code.i was covered up from head to toe.but apparently my stockings were not suitable.it disturbs me even more that they were watching me.😳 so now i have been sitting at this bus stop for 2 hours for two reasons: one: i live in a single room occupancy hotel in skid row for the formerly homeless.......so i'm as close to homeless as you can get.a "housing first" program pays my rent until i get some sort of regular income going.i am hearing impaired as well as having some communication problems.i was raised by an ex-jehovah witness & paranoid schizophrenic (father) who disliked my mother (middle eastern) because of her "white privelege",yet he had three kids with her.🙄hence why i cant maintain any sort of regular employment due to extreme anxiety because i stayed in while my 2 brothers became delinquents. two: i was just forced out of a wal-mart because my black crosshatch stockings were a tad thin due to weight gain from antidepressants,depression & buying them from wal-mart,ironically. its only for the rest of the day i'm restricted from this store but when i was homeless back in 2016 sometimes the cops would tell me to leave the library for the day during that time of the month because i didnt have anywhere to shower.at least this time i can pretend to sleep while i hear my neighbor & the five women in his efficiency room party all night. so i guess i've got to leave this bus stop now but for safery reasons it will be a while before i shop at this particular wal-mart again.they are so cheap......instead of security they put a police camera in the parking lot to watch out for employees engaging in union activity as well as for general security.ironically,my mother works for wal-mart & constantly tells me to forget about theater & work for wal-mart. fuck wal-mart!!!!!!!!! i sleep with a replica of the straight razor from sweeney todd:the demon barber of fleet street (2007).i wait for a day when i'm strong enough to use it. i may shop at target for awhile. at least they dont put their deodorant behind plastic like wal-mart does in low income cities like south central la or southgate or pico rivera (california) sending the silent message that you are less than human. i am not trying to escape responsibility for anything.the security guard was very polite........as he forced me to leave the wal-mart immediately because of an innocent mistake.he acted like i had a disease or something......the way he stood there.he was about to tell me that i couldnt even pay for my groceries but i guess his decency (which wal-mart hasn't robbed from him,yet) allowed me that. so i'm still at this bus stop & its been almost two hours.even if i didnt consume large amounts pf caffeinated beverages.....i wont be sleeping tonight.at least i learned something today. one: shop at target two: this world is fucked up. "family friendly" my ass....... ......wal-mart just took millions earlier this year in profit & instead of giving people like my 64 year old disabled mother (who has worked at wal-mart for 10 years) a raise.......they gave it back to their stockholders. wal-mart: 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 i'm such a coward when it comes to pain but tonight would be so great if i didn't wake up tomorrow.this world is so fucked up....... oh i'm sorry......that wasn't very family friendly,now was it?😔 i	1

summer jobs will be the death of me i'm sorry if this comes off as whiney and first-class problems but i'm upset and need to vent about how i'm feeling. my mom has been pressuring me to get a job since the start of the 2017-2018 school year. it hasn't been helpful pressuring either (if there even is that kind of stuff) it's been screaming matches and nitpicking my resume until i don't even recognize my own words. it's getting to be late june, i've just filled out an application for chipotle and i never got the call back even after the interviewer told me i did really well. i was bummed. i'm starting to get burned out cuz places like kfc don't even want me. i can't get a single measly call back let alone the actual job. i want a job to pay for the stuff my parents won't (i'm 17), like clothes and dr's appointments and stuff. i don't even have a cell phone because my mom took mine away years ago and never gave it back. my boyfriend has a really great job at noodles and lots of friends and he loves it there. i'm so incredibly jealous of him. i would work as a garbage collector of it meant i could just have something to do. i can't get the motivation to apply to places anymore. i just got into a giant argument with my mom about how i'm a slacker and i never apply myself. i just want it to end. i really do. i know this is such a lame thing to consider ///death/// over but there's only so much rejections a person can take before she sees it as an issue. my family is lower middle class and i know the extra money after i'm gone (bye bye college fund) would really help them. my sister wouldn't have to grow up seeing a toxic mindset (she's 9, i'm not a good role model). my boyfriend would have a better girlfriend and a less toxic relationship as i can imagine my 3am suicide rants aren't a good thing for him. my friends wouldn't have to deal with my crap anymore either. i'm such a worthless kid i don't do anything. i'm not in sports, theater or on the student council. i'm just a kid who likes to write and apparently i'm not good enough and cut out to live past my teenage years. thank you for letting me rant, i'm sorry it's so long. i just feel so lonely and awful all the time and this unemployment is really not helping. i just needed someone to listen to me. 😊	1

how to make vday/2year anniversary special?? so my boyfriend(m34) and i(f23) have been together two years on february 14 and i really really want to do something special. we're going out to a nice dinner on the following sunday to avoid vday crowds, but i'm thinking about surprising him with a home cooked dinner on our actual anniversary and we can do gifts then. i don't really cook😅 so i'm trying to figure out what to make and it be easy but still good. also he lives with his mom right now to save money while he's in med school and i'm wondering is it too rude to ask her if i can borrow the kitchen to cook for just the two of us? she's known me for about two years now, but i'm just not sure if that's crossing a boundary. in the past we try to cook for the two of us and she joins in and sits down and kinda kills the mood so i'm not really sure what to do in that situation? does anyone have any tips on asking her as well as what to cook lol. on a scale from 1-bobby flay i'm cereal and toast. tl:dr; special vday/anniversary dinner at home ideas?? also is it okay to ask my bfs mom to specifically let me cook dinner just for the two of us without her interrupting?	0

mental heath unit anxietytrigger warning (od, suicide attempt) - - - hey guys hope your all doing well (just of a bit background i'm in the u.k) i took an od on friday, i was really depressed and took beta blockers and sedating antidepressants, i didn't think it was that serious until i woke up in intensive care the next day with tubes and lines everywhere after they managed to stabilise me i self discharged and tried again and it all happened again, i can't say i regretted doing it as i don't i have tried before this but , they're now keeping me in a hospital ward with the threat of section if i leave until they can find a bed at a mhu (psych ward for the american brothers) i am slightly anxious as i haven't needed to go in since i was a teen, they're talking about the priory in chelmsford, i was there years ago in adolescence but this time it will be adults i was just wondering as to what i can expect, they currently have me on regular clonazepam to chill me out and to help my ptsd. but i'm still having bad anxiety about going into there, can anyone who has been in a private/nhs adult mental health unit give me an idea of how it's gonna be please, is it gonna be as bad as i think or hopefully you guys can put my mind to rest 🙏 thanks everyone	1

sad boy hours 😢 me and my girlfriend of almost 9 months split... she left me cuz her parents wanted us to split and she thought it'd be difficult because.... i'm not a christian and her family is super christian. we had it so well together... she didn't want to leave either but she saw it as the best option. i just find it annoying that religion matters tbh, i liked her allot and we had many good times together :,( i gotta respect her decision tho cuz u mean she made some good points and i don't wanna be an ass and make her mad, we still plan on being friends but it'll never be the same again. im gonna miss her, back to isolating myself and being sad oof	0

why do i always feel this way so i'm definatly not on here for attention and i guess its more that i just need help or someone to talk to but man have i been having a tough time lately and it just seems like ill look back and just everything in my life seems like a big failure i go back to my youngest memories as a kid and even then i am like wow you were always at the bottom in life, i dont look bad either and im very outgoing and sociable too, some would even consider me to be the life of the party but man if these people spent a minute in my head theyd be in for a real shocker. i dont know what's wrong with me but i cant stop blaming myself hating myself and everything negative that goes with it and it seems like i don't have the willpower either to get ahead because i constantly feel like shit or when it starts getting good then boom something bad happens so its like this constant feeling of failure and it just makes me want to give up 😔 i don't actually want to commit suicide i just want to feel better and stop telling myself that i'm better to the world dead	1

please help i don't know how much longer i have until i finally break. i'm losing my motivation and will to live. i've spoken to lots of people about my troubles and nothing helps. i've started to avoid my main supports, and it doesn't even seem like they've noticed. i'm alone, sad, frustrated, and i've had enough of it. i have no future and i barely have anything going on for me now. i abuse drugs just so i can laugh and be happy, but recently it just leaves me numb. i can't do anything that used to make me happy because my confidence is so low that i cry and get angry whenever i make a mistake. my friends are tired of me. my counsellor is tired of me. my therapist is tired of me. i'm really fucking tired of myself and i don't know what to do about it. i can't talk about any of my problems anymore because nobody wants to hear it anymore. i feel misunderstood by all my peers and i just want to feel normal. it feels like my only way out is suicide and i've thought about it so much i can't possibly imagine being alive in the next 5 years. the only reason i'm still here is because a teacher kept me hopeful and was a very important person to me, but unfortunately i want the best for him and i don't think i should be in his life. my last exam is tomorrow and i'm afraid i won't be able to make it through the summer because i only have one friend. after high school i'll be forgotten by everyone and nothing, including me, will matter. i don't want to die but i don't have any other choice. if you even bothered to read all this, thank you ❤️	1
cassette tape stories 🤔 (okay a bit of background, i've always thought that being a voice actor would be an amazing job, and i also have plenty ideas for stories to tell.) so i recently found a cassette tape recorder, and i had the crazy idea of narrating some stories onto cassette tapes, just for fun. my mom says it's a waste of $60, but i think it'll keep be productive this summer and it's a pretty cool idea. should i go through with it? what stories should i tell? do half of you know what a cassette tape is?	0

hey, you. yes, you. come here. you're beautiful and don't you ever forget it. you're so brave and bold and powerful because life has kicked you down n times but you get up n+1 times. you got up even if it was just on your knees and you punched life in the face and said "no i'm here to stay". if you're unsure about your body, i want you to understand that you're beautiful no matter what you look like. don't let anybody tell you otherwise, not even yourself. if you're depressed because your love life has taken a turn for the worse or you're lonely, i'm here to tell you that just because you're single it doesn't mean you're undesirable or unwanted or unloved it just means that there's somebody out there who is waiting to be the missing puzzle piece and your other half. the person who is as broken and beautiful as you are and look at you and see what i see and what you should see: that you are flipping amazing. they will look at your flaws but they will accept you for them. they will love you because you are more than the sum of your parts. people who are in that place rn where they think they're worthless and nobody could care less whether you lived or died, here's the thing. you're wrong. people care. somewhere, somebody cares. and if you look at yourself and decide the world would be better off without you lemme tell you something: you're wrong. somewhere in the past, present, or future somebody has or will meet you and you will have made such an impact in their life because you are an overflowing well of potential. you are beautiful. you are worth more than the universe has to offer. you are unique. you are broken a little but never defeated. you are far more intelligent than you give yourself credit for. you are loved. if you need an ear or shoulder, i am here. keep on keeping on and remember to take a breather. you deserve it. 💞	0

has anyone ever felt like this? ☹️ does anyone know how painfully lonely it is to have absolutely no one? the one person i thought i had (my boyfriend) beat me up 3 weeks ago and i'm just so ready to leave this earth. everyday i practically beg people to talk to me to call me to hang out with me and nobody ever does. so i know for sure no one would miss me if i go, and that hurts me so much more	1

ladies, what's your opinion on skinny guys? i'm m18 and i'm 6'0 and only 8.5 stone (roughly 55 kg i think but not sure though). i've always struggled to gain weight, i have a fast metabolism and also lose a lot of weight through gad. i feel that my rib cage, skinny arms etc look disgusting. it seems like the only advice i and any other guy ever gets is "oh just eat more" "oh just go to the gym". but with some of the problems i experience i can't do those things consistently. i was wondering if being incredibly skinny is a deal breaker for you guys. be honest please, cheers. 💚 tl;dr: is being skinny a dealbreaker for you	0
i feel like i have a really weird taste in music hi everybody! recently just found this nice sub reddit so thought i'd post something that's really been on my mind. i have always been told by my friends that i have had a super weird taste (for a teenage boy) in music and i would describe it as..... broad? i'll just list some songs and albums that i love. shoulda been there ft. b.o.b. - sevyn streeter magnets ft. lorde - disclosure the entire lemonade album by beyonce a fever you can't sweat out - panic! at the disco (the whole album) anything made by pentatonix or lady leshurr or florence + the machine blurryface - twentyonepilots (the album) the pinkprint - nicki minaj (the album) there are a lot of songs i love but my main question is, is it weird to like these types of music if you are a teenage boy?? from past experiences, i didn't respond well to my friends teasing me for the music i listen to. sooooooo i thought a bunch of nice strangers online can judge me instead 😁 thanks! edit : wow! my first post in this subreddit and such a quick and nice response! why can't everything be like this lmao	0

i will be dead tomorrow, wanted to let everything out before i die i will be dead tomorrow( the plans are already in place and well thought out). the reasons for this is the last 5 years of my life has been hell: -had severe depression and dissociation for the last 5 years with intense suicidal ideation for a lot of it. nothing is real to me which makes dying easy. tried multiple treatments which have worsened my condition. am now sleeping 15 hours a day missing everything and not responding to anyone. - decided to try uni( fairly good uni) and decided to try to find love as a last treatment resort. found it and it was going very well and i was cheated on. i was destroyed emotionally and gave another chance, believing it was a drunken mistake. 2 weeks later it happened again and i've been in a severe depressive episode for the last 2 months. a couple of my relatives also died during the same time. -discovered last week i failed the only exam i needed to pass out of all of them to get to next year so i will have to resit. it makes no fucking sense to me why that module needs to be passed, it links to my subject the least out of the fucking lot of them. i also worked the hardest on that shitty module knowing it was the one i had to pass. i did the best i could with the intense emotional pain of being cheated on and having to visit relatives in hospital on their fucking death bed. i want to confess this because my life has been hell for the last 5 years. the thing that hurt me the most was definitely being cheated on by the one i love. being the only girl ive ever noticed out of a crowded room and connected to on a whole different level to anyone i've met, including my family. this has meant my own judgement doesn't make sense and the world doesn't make sense to me in that regard. i can't understand things at all anymore. hope the word gets fucking better for others and less painful in the future, peace out 😇 tl;dr will be dead tomorrow and wanted to let everything out	1

my (31m) girlfriend (29f) tells her friends that she thinks a coworker is hot we've (29f 31m) been dating a year and a half and just got our first home together. my girlfriend is a resident at a big hospital. i've noticed a few times that she has talked to other other coworkers about another resident that she finds attractive. her most recent comment - "just ran into __ the hot resident. makes my day" to which her friend replied "oh i see what you do all day. just ignore your boyfriend 😂"... important details: i have issues with insecurity and feel like she is attracted more to others. we had amazing sex for the first 6 months, now it's just meh. it's always when she wants, not me, and she claims to only want it about once a week. she made a comment today about how i'm "more interested in the sexual side of the relationship" whereas she values the "other things such as building a home together". i told her that just because i value one doesn't mean i devalue the other, because i feel i discuss both all the time. tl;dr my girlfriend says she loves me and i have nothing to worry about, but she is telling her friends that a coworker is hot. i can admit i have insecurities. our sex life is subpar. anyways, thoughts on this situation? thanks guys.	0

my dad is encouraging my suicide, again, and i'm really thinking about doing it once and for all.. tomorrow my dad and i are supposed to travel to a country that i am not a fan of and i am forced to go there. i told him i can't go there; i never feel comfortable in this particular country, but he said that he would stab or choke me if i argue any more with him about it any longer. so i have been crying all day, i still am. extra info: - i am a young teen - i am depressed and have really strong anxiety - my dad is pretty sociopathic - he told me that the only thing that i can do to contribute to society is committing suicide, which made me even more depressed 😞	1

help exposing cheating (34m) who is treating (30f) like dirt. 6 month relationship but it's serious. i feel so guilty knowing what i know. okay... so... my fiance has this friend let's call him bob. bob has a girlfriend, let's call her mary. they've been seeing each other for around 6 months. mary is currently looking after his pet while he's away on holiday (cheating on her). bob has cheated on every single woman that he's ever been with and he brags about it to his friends (hence why i've been burdened with this information). bob had a 2 year affair with his sister-in-law behind one girlfriends backs, was sleeping with prostitutes whilst with another and he actually attacked his most recent ex partner when she challenged him with proof about cheating on her and left her with bruises all over her body. that poor girl invested 3 years of her life in him and he broke her down emotionally with his lies and eventually physically. the last time i saw her she was in a terrible place mentally, had lost all her trust and self confidence and if i'm honest, seemed like a shadow of the happy, bubbly girl she used to be. it's safe to say i'm not a fan of bob, but i stay civil because he's one of my partners oldest friends. i know it's none of my business but mary seems so lovely, smart, attractive, funny & sweet. i really want to warn her before she gets in too deep and gets her heart broken, she deserves better- everyone deserves better than bob. before bob went away he told my boyfriend that he planned to get 'as much strange as possible' whilst away, he packed 'enough condoms to fuck three times a day for the two weeks he's there. i hate that i know this information but me and my oh are very open with eachother and many of the comments i've overheard while they've been on the phone or messaging when we're having a snuggle. my oh doesn't condone bob's behaviour and has given his opinion in cheating, he doesn't go out drinking with bob anymore but as they grew up so closely he feels that he is more like family and therefore 'accepts him as he is' as he is a good friend to him- even though he treats women like shit. i really don't know what to do. i don't want this girl to end up like all the others, i want her to know what he's like now and save herself the heartache or a life of being with someone who will be (and already is) disrespecting her. i'd be devastated and humiliated if i found out my man was like bob. i can't tell her myself as it will have repercussions for me and my oh. does anyone have any experience with things like this? i can't get it off my mind, the guilt of knowing is killing me and she's absolutely smitten with him, i couldn't live with myself if they eventually married and i'd done nothing. thanks in advance. ❤️ tl;dr - how to save a woman from getting in deep with a man who will treat her badly.	0
i brought a dead rabbit back to live from my dog and put it in a cage dead so i just got back home from work. my dog is laying on the back patio covered in dirt with a rabbit in his mouth😳. the rabbit's not bloody, just dirty. now, my neighbor's kids raise these blue ribbon winner rabbits🤔. i instantly knew it was one of their rabbits🤦‍♀️. so i took the rabbit away from my dog, i rushed inside, washed all the dirt off it before my neighbors could come home. it was stiff but i heard some animals play dead when they are afraid, i couldn't remember which animals because i was nervous 😨. i took it and placed it back in one of the cage, then i 🏃‍♀️zoomed back home. not 30 minutes later i hear my neighbors screaming😳. so i go out and ask them what's wrong? 🤫 they tell me their rabbit died three days ago and they buried it but now it's back in the cage.😖	0

[update] i'm (25f) backpacking alone and met a really hot guy that makes me consider throwing my 3,5 year relationship away. i'm being stupid right? link to original post: <url> i'm not sure whether it's still visible to others (it is in my app but not in the browser) so will for good measure put the original in the comments. first of all, thanks to the people who took the time to write to me and get my thoughts cleared out. on to what happened: i broke it off with my bf a few days later. as mentioned in the comments, i'd tried to do it many times in the past and he had always made me stay. we were incompatible in a multitude of ways, including children, lifestyles, weed and hobbies. i always felt that he pushed me into a relationship even though i never really fell in love with him. he acknowledges this as being true. in the beginning after the breakup, he was contacting me obsessively while i kept blocking him, begging my mom and best friends to make me change my mind. i told him to get out of my apartment as it was taking a toll on my roommate. then the attempts of contact got fewer and further between. i met with him by the end of april to exchange belongings, we had a few beers and talked about stuff. he said the breakup came as a shock (?) and that he was hospitalized for a brief period. but he since went to spend time with his family overseas and is getting better and dating again :) he hopes that i won't completely exclude him from my life, which i don't intend to. now on to ash. we hooked up (after i broke up!) as expected. he showed me how amazing sex can be when you actually have chemistry! we had a good thing going for a short while, but it quickly became clear that we are pretty different people and he eventually told me he thought we were incompatible. i was hurt, but he was right. i haven't seen him since the beginning of february and never initiate contact, but once in a while he will indirectly let me know he is masturbating over whatsapp. fascinating stuff. this last part has nothing to do with the original story but if anyone is interested in what happend after, here goes: i was as expected a little down for a while after it ended with ash. however, i moved on and met some great and fun people. one of them was mike. 😅 we had been friends for a few days and eventually hooked up (never had a one night stand btw) and i felt a good connection with him. unfortunately i had booked a ticket to the other side of the country that day and we talked about maybe meeting later on somewhere else in sea. about 10 days later i could feel a bit of travel fatigue/loneliness and wrote to him. he said he was going home to his state in the us, let's say ohio. i'm european btw. he said i should come, we could go camping and see many beautiful things. now i know this make me look insane, but i wasnt having fun where i was and said fuck it, never been to the us anyways. got my esta, bought a ticket with return to my home country a month later. i arrived and that state is paradise. i loved it. the waterfalls, volcanoes, beaches, i even got to swim with wild dolphins and turtles!! mostly hitchhiking and camping. mike was a sweetheart, i liked our conversations and the sex too. i fell for him.. we were basically together 24/7 for a month and he was so great, the adventures where exciting and i got a bit carried away.. i took care of him too, when he was quite often in alot of pain. but i had to go home then, we were both broke. i thought maybe we could keep in contact and see how it goes, i'd be willing to relocate if things kept going well. but it's clear he doesn't want that, he says he has to focus on his own life and doesn't have much time to talk or even chat. but that "we never know what the future brings". i am trying to let go. he has to work, he has to receive treatment that comes with nausea and pain. coming home with no real job and depressed because of heartbreak/travels ending, wasn't fun. but i'm glad i broke up with my bf and i feel confident that it was the best decision for both of us. thanks again, reddit. tl;dr broke up with bf and didn't regret it	0

tommorow might be my day so i've been dealing with depression for almost 2 years now and tomorrow this shit is probably going to end so i thought i'd share my story here quickly. sorry if the formatting is weird, i'm on mobile so this all started february 2017. i started putting myself in bad social circles, hanging out with the wrong people. i've always had issues making friends and i've been bullied a lot throughout school. i'm now 17 years old. i started self harming this february because i felt guilty and ashamed of who i was spending my time with and who i was becoming. this just got worse and worse and i went from harming with steak knives to pen knives to razor blades and occasionally i burnt myself and scratched myself with a metal ruler until my skin was so raw that i bled out of the pores all down my arm. up until june 2018, this just got worse and worse. i had more and more suicidal thoughts. in may 2018 i dropped out of 6th form, struggling to even get out of bed in the morning. this just made things worse until june the 12th. this was the day that i tried to kill myself. i cut my wrist open with a razor blade and then cut a second time in the same place. i was going to cut again, i was deep in my wrist but i hadn't hit the vein yet. i was going to end it all but when i saw what i'd done, i was disgusted in myself and i decided to stop. i went downstairs to my dad and he drove me to hospital. i had 4 stitches and that was the end of that. after that, i started back at school but my useless ass eventually dropped out and started at the shitty local college. i knew i could do more than get a crappy diploma but when i was struggling to even find the motivation to get up. i stopped cutting after june the 12th but i started again 4 days ago. i've missed the last 3 weeks of college but tomorrow i'm meant to go back. i don't know if i can go back. i just feel so bad and i've been feeling this way for nearly 2 years now. i think i'm done with this shit. it doesn't matter anyways so i think that in the morning, i'm going to end this life. this whole fucking thing is a joke. i'm a privileged white teenager with a nice family. i don't have any issues near as important as most other people and yet i'm struggling to cope more than all them. i'm a pussy, its that simple. so tomorrow i'm going to do something stupid. maybe i'll pussy out again and just end up in the hospital but if i don't post again, i've put an end to this shit for good. thanks for reading and i hope you all have nice lives 😊	1

2018 is almost over, but it has been a ride! my post is going to be pretty short and sweet, but it's the reason i'm happy right now and i thought i'd share 😊 my workplace probation is over today, and that means i've been accepted full time to a good paying job and a workers union in my hometown. also this past year i met the girl of my dreams, and things are on nothing but the upswing 😊 in 22 days i'm going to be moving in with her, and the thought of doing so makes me all flutter and happy inside! things have never gone better for me. this past year i've also quit smoking two packs of john players a day to being smoke free! today marks seven months for that. i'm just greatful that sometimes hard work does pay off, and i've grown to see that change in myself. now i can go to work and enjoy my job stress free, and focus on being happy in my new home and maybe even start a family in the next few years. i hope all of you guys have an awesome day today! thanks for reading 😊📖 peace reddit ✌🏼❤️	0

i dont know anymore i don't know how much i have the energy to write plus i won't probs care abt grammar that much rn so i am sorry for this mess. i have been mildly derpressed my whole childhood, i have always been masculine which i have been bullied about at school and home. things got worse around sixth grade (abt 12yo) when i stopped getting any "entertainment" from my usual things like playing and school and tv etc. around this time i also realized i was fat and started to struggle with weight management. i started to lose weight "very unhealthily" basicallt eating almost nothing. and i got to a weight where i'm now able to hide my slight chubbyness with clothes. this all went unnoticed by my family since my sister started cutting and being suicidal and i didnt want to add to that. fastforward to eight grade(14-15yo) i started to struggle with anxiety and my depression gpt a bit worse. during ninth grade anxiety gpt even worse and depression with that. 16yo i didnt have anxiety issues anymore but my depression got alot worse, quickly. during this time i was also manipulated by a "friend" who at the end ended up forcing me to some sexual stuff. thia destroyes me completely. i started smoking and walking on roads wishing that a car would hit me or walking on train tracks etc. i started having some self harming tendensies. summer came so things easiet up coz i got away from the person who manipulated etc me. at this time my depression was at its worse i changed schools during the summer coz i couldnt go back to my old school because of this person. around this time my dpression was abt the same as earlier but i managed it better and didnt do selfharm stuff. now school started around 3months ago. i have not gotten any better and for abt 3weeks it has started getting rly bad again. i keep fantasizing dying but rn im at that point that i wont do it coz i dont want to hurt my family. kind pf waiting for my self to stop being a pussy so i dont need to suffer anymore. the thing is that i havent rly told anyone how bad it is because i cant, its completely against my personality and i just cant. plus i dont want to cause negativitt to my friends etc life. also around 14-15yo i was hopeful like "oh but it wioo get better", i still try to force myself to think that but im definitely losing hope, things have just gotten worse during the last 5years and i dont know how long i'll be able to not break and honestly this even scares me a bit. i dont even know the point of this post but i needed to tell someone and i thought that maybe itll feel better after writing (+i cant write to my friends etc) but like i said im just really, really done. i have been so depressed these last three weeks and the only time i didnt feel completely shit was when i was drinking but i'm starting to have problems with that too(+basically starting to have some unhealthy "habits"). i dont see any hope in the future and i just dont want to live anymore. i cant do anything, i dont remember anything (i feel like i keep dissociating all the time or something like that idk, but i cant remember even the whole day without rly having to think abt it and maybe even but the either). i cant sleep, but im always tired so i just lay in bed. i cant eat because it makes me wanna throwup and just the thought of eating is causing an uneasy feeling in my stomach. i cant study but i keep going to classes so my parents dont notice my illness (i dont live with them but they got notified since im under 18 if i dont go to class). basically i cant rly do anything and i just keep feeling worse and crying all the time. thanks for reading if someone did (also i wrote this also because if i get worse and end up taking mylife(not planning rn) maybe my family will find this from my phone and understand a bit) i guess i just need some encouragement or something to keep living idk, please something positive.

realization of depressionimagine this, imagine that you finally get that engineering degree from college after 6 years of fighting only to find out that the real world has nothing for you. that it was completely meaningless in the first place, that all your hard work, everything you've ever worked hard for meant nothing. it was a waste. i can't get a job because i have no experience and i can't get experience without a job. degree was just a piece of paper. and now depression/anxiety got me in it's grasp and i know if i talk to people i will choke or lock up. i can't do interviews because i'm depressed and i'm depressed because i don't have a job. i have nothing going for me; no friends, no career, and no fun. i just work this shitty job as a substitute teacher's aid for for special needs kids and i totally hate it. been working this job for 4 years now, and it has gotten me nowhere. i wish i could just die. the agony that my dreams have been crushed by my inability to progress and proceed for the next step. everything i've learned in college has faded away as everyday i watched youtube videos. i have lost all motivation to live. i used to have a drive, passionate, to get out of bed every morning and enjoy my day. now, it's me in my bedroom, dark, cold, alone with my phone and my thoughts of the future. i want to end it all, but if hades is real then fk. i want to numb the pain. taking antidepressants but they do nothing. i'm lying to my mom that they are working. i can't live on like this. i want to die because i cannot live. i'm sorry, i have failed you. 🔫	1

waiting to leave this worldcant believe im so desperate that id post this but.. im 18 and been diagnosed with chronic clinical depression. ever since the day i was born everyone around me knew something was wrong with me, i never smiled, seemed genuinely happy, or acted like anyone else. i was just a blank faced an never showed much emotion in any situation. throughout my young teenage years, ive tried to better improve myself by smiling more, showing more enthusiasm, and trying to be a basic human being. eventually i developed those habits and everyone around me started to open up to me. they always compliment me on how happy i am, how i can smile all the time, but holy shit if they only knew every day i wake up from suicidal dreams, wishing i never woke up. whenever i see my friends, id wish that they just forget about me, or atleast that i can be of some use to them. everyday i have to hide the vertical slits on my forearm. everyday i have to try to be a normal human being, but i really just cant. ive tried therapy, counselors, psycological meds, mediation, you name it. mostly everything just doesnt work. the only things that do work to just numb the pain is booze, weed, cbd, and sleep. i wish i could feel atleast alright when im just breathing. my life isnt even that bad, ive done great in school, living middle class, going to a prestigious college, and already built up savings for the future. whenever i mention if i committed suicide, people who know me would just say the same "wtf, id do almost anything to be in your position", but never did they mention that i shouldnt, or that im worth something. so now here i am, thinking how spoiled i am to even consider taking my life, reaching out to you guys... if i missed anything that you need to know, ill be more than happy to answer them ☺️	1
i wanna marry someone and have kids but i hate my own genetic predisposition diseases fuck. maybe i'll find a child free girl and adopt dude, i don't fuckin know. i think it'll be one of the most challenging problems of my entire life. which is why i'm totally putting off thinking about it and instead bottling it up 😉	0

ruined my chances with a whole group of people. ah, isn't that a nice smell in the evening i was in a group chat like i mentioned in my previous post (that people are downvoting for no reason) and completely ruined my odds with everyone in that group by saying i was leaving because nobody was answering when i tried to start a conversation, so i left and now i get to live the rest of my summer knowing i fucked up my chances with like 7 people because of my shit social skills. 😎	0

this thread is worthless what the fuck is the point of reaching out. it's like no one actually gives a shit. vague generic platitudes are the best anyone can offer. i'm tired of trying my best and somehow choosing the worst possible option every time. figures considering i tested out of high school and pursued music. right 🙄. like anyone wants to hear that shit.	1

i accidentally flipped off my mom i was riding my bike in my neighborhood yesterday and i was almost home. so as i'm turning a corner near my apartment, this car behind me honks at me. a lot of people in my area can't drive for shit, and more than a few people honk at me aggressively(share the road assholes) and have tried to hit me with their cars in the bike lane. anyways i glanced behind me and just thought the driver was just another one of those freaks. i held up my hand and kept pedaling. the car followed me into the alley that leads to my apt. then the driver honked a bunch of times. i got pretty mad so i turned my head and put up my middle finger at them. then the car sped up and passed me. they rolled down the window and...surprise surprise! it was my mom😳😳	0
i don't feel like his girlfriend (8 months) sometimes (24f, 25m) title is as it says, i really don't feel good sometimes about our relationship. background is i'm his first serious girlfriend, he asked me in june (met the family, friends, talked future etc) and i got out of an abusive relationship of five years before him after taking some time off with therapy before dating. when my boyfriend is good to me, he's very sweet, treats me amazingly, haven't had a better boyfriend before. when he's not, he can be kind of a jerk (either intentionally or unintentionally). to be honest, there are some days i wonder if he even likes me, let alone loves me like he says. yesterday, he was telling me about how everybody at his work is single (then proceeded to go through the list of his coworkers-only 4 of them were) and that kind of made me feel like shit. afterwards he called me a buzzkill for getting annoyed at him purposely being annoying, so i just went to sleep pretty annoyed. some days he'll be all over me with pda, some days he'll be walking two feet ahead of me. another thing is he will literally do the opposite of whatever i say. like, he'll give me two choices, i'll pick one, he will 9/10 pick the other one. he's said in the past that i'm boring, but when i suggest things to do (ie last week there was a last minute comedy show, i suggested we go but he opted out-again) he usually says no. i don't even think he really cares when people hit on me. he said that yesterday, we were talking about a mutual friend who is kind of known for being a creep. in fairness to him, i do get a bunch of random guys adding me on facebook and i mentioned changing my relationship status on fb to dissuade some of them. (he said "to what?" (🚩) but proceeded to update his and mine). sometimes i feel like i'm just there for show, advice and regular sex. he likes bragging about me to people, i'm always around his family or friends, sometimes attending his family things without him. i'm starting to feel very alone in my relationship. like i'm not appreciated as a person by someone that i actually do love. :( sorry for the lengthy post, but even then i've barely scratched the surface. tldr: i am my boyfriends first serious girlfriend. i get the feeling sometimes that he doesn't even actually like me as a person, just likes having me around to show off and have sex with. when he's not like that, he's amazing. i'm starting to feel very alone in my relationship and insecure about my place here. also am trying not to let past relationship issues skew my judgement.	0

not cleaning up after myself this just happened a few minutes ago. i had manly urges while getting ready in the bathroom. i was going to finish in a hand towel but dropped it right as it was about to happen and, knowing that i wouldn't be able to grab it in time, lunged for the bathtub and did it there instead. a few minutes later i remembered that i hadn't run the shower to rinse it down the drain so i returned to the bathroom to do that. thinking i was going to run the faucet for her to have a drink, my cat hopped into the tub. i'm pretty sure my splooge is now on one or more of her paws. 😔	0

her i luv all my friends, but one makes me especially happy, and i think i make her happy too. she brings out the smile in me that was missing all these yrs. and if i leave, i hope she can realize that it was not her fault, she has been such a help. can you remember my seat in art class when i'm gone and remember my jokes? visualize me like i'm a hologram? can my spirit make you smile when i leave?💔 i feel so much shame and anger. everytime i see some of you classmates i feel degraded. it was 5 months ago but i feel like i failed. if i do not kill myself, the sadness would be the cause. you do not realize how shocking and moving suicide is until you lose someone forever. but can you look back at my chair and remember how i made you laugh, how i sat next to you in lunch and giggled 24/7, the times you guys would playfully whoop my ass. i rly love you, you make me smile, but the pain is too much.🤐	1

amazon delayed my mother's day gift, and it really made me sad. have prime shipping, ordered 4 days in advance for mother's day. made sure to check the package was going to arrive for mother's day. it was barely being processed for delivery on saturday. i just used in store pickup at "blank" store (don't want to come across as a shill) gonna pick it up later today fingers cross that goes well. this gift a lot less thoughtless than my original gift, at least my mom is getting two presents now 😊 even if one is late.	0
it's funny how life works sometimes tonight, i went to a meetup for young professionals at one of those new-retro speakeasies. now, i don't go downtown that often because i hate trying to find parking downtown. now i went down there when it was getting really busy as well. now that coupled with struggling to find parking had me getting frustrated. i finally found parking and then came the challenge of trying to find this place (speakeasy so no obvious signage). i wondered over downtown for a while, and got frustrated again and i was just like screw this, i'm going to go home. then, as i was walking back to my car, i overheard someone ask where this particular speakeasy was. so then i ended up going to the meetup. it was super packed and so hard to just get a drink. when i finally did get a bartenders attention, i ended up paying like $22 for a kettle one double. but what really turned this night around was the fact i met a great girl tonight. we hit it off pretty well, and about an hour or so of talking with her, i managed to get her number! i plan on inviting her out for drinks again this friday as well 😄 funny how things happen in life. if i had given up and just gone home, i never would've met this girl. i'm trying not to get too overconfiden, but i am happy i was successful.	0
oh boy another post complaining ok so basically this fucking girl led me on for like 2 weeks and then i asked her if she wanted to watch fireworks with me today. and i get ghosted. i text her, i try calling her to see if she's ok(she's an abuse victim i just wanted to make sure she hadn't offed herself). then (here's the really good part) i get a text from a number i don't know, and appearlantley it's her fucking #boyfreind. the text basically said back the fuck off and that she wasn't fond of me at all. so yeah, i wanna kill myself right now. 👌🏻	0

sleep deprived but panicked so, i had a strange incident last night. i didn't sleep for whatever reason and a big bug (pretty sure it was a roach) fell from the ceiling/vent/light whatever- onto my bed... of course, i took my blanket (untouched by the roach) and attempted to sleep in the living room until morning. well, the day has passed and i should sleep again. but i don't want that thing on my bed or the thought of it falling onto my bed again. i really don't want to sleep on the couch again but it looks like my only choice unless someone else has a suggestion...? 😓	0
why is he (m27) still talking to me (f23) even though it's been over a year since we met and he has so many other options?! *super lengthy post so click off if you don't want to read it rather than complaining about how long it is in the comments, but i really need advice and opinions and keep in mind he looks like milo ventigimlia (google him)* i met a man several months ago on a dating app. he was kind, and sweet. we spoke for a month before we met up (i was really busy with exams and work). i wasn't expecting him to wait that long but he did. we texted and snapchatted a ton but didn't speak on the phone cuz he didn't like phone calls...which was fine. both of us were looking for something casual and a no strings attached situation after coming out of serious relationships. i told him i didn't want to drop my pants for someone the first time i meet them so i won't be having sex the first time, he was completely fine with that. when we finally met up we had such a great time! we got along great and made out tons. he didn't want the date to end so i did go back to his place but we just rolled around in bed basically dry humping and making out. he's a guy that's slept with a lot of women. i could tell he knows how to please a woman too. again, we both wanted a very casual nsa thing. before we met but spoke a lot he told me he was falling for me (ummm...), that he'd be my date to a fam wedding of mine, that i should go to his cottage over the summer with him and his friends etc. also during the date when i went to his house i met his friends and he gave me a tour of his whole house he was proud of building. he was talking about his godson and how one day i'll meet him too. after the date we still spoke but not to the extent we use to. we'd still talk every day though (he'd mostly initiate it). i was busy again whenever he wanted to meet up and this time he wanted to meet for sex and hanging out which was understandable (i know i was being shitty here by being too busy but i did have a lot going on and it was a very tough time in my life...). plus i felt fuck buddies didn't need to meet all the time. about 2 weeks after our first date... i asked if he was down for drink that following friday or thursday night. he said he was busy with school (i knew that was a lie cuz he only has school mon-wed) but he'd let me know. he replied to my text to hang out 4 days after i sent it and he was active on social media during that time. i replied saying if you're not interested anymore that's totally fine and to let me know rather than leave me hanging... i also wished him well with school. i didn't want to end in a negative way cuz i hate that. anyways he never replied to that text so i was like okay on to the next then! he did keep watching my snapchat stories though. a month later he contacted me by sending me a shirtless mirror selfie 😂 i couldn't help but laugh and was caught off guard. i was seeing someone else at the time casually but immaturely and rudely wanted to keep him on the hook like he basically kept me on the hook. he's very attractive and i can tell he'd be a good lay. for a good 10ish days we were back to snapping every day but i was a lot colder. i kept saying i was busy and that i'd let him know when i'm free and then he said okay let me know. i said will do and he stopped contacting again. he also stopped watching my snap stories which was unusual behaviour from him. 3-4 months later i created an instagram. somehow he was one on the first 30 people to follow me (i guess i came up in is suggested contacts or something). he likes almost all my pictures and watches my instagram stories. i know he's seeing women and doing this with them too since it's clearly evident. wtf is up with this dude? i posted a picture to my instagram story of a baked item i made and he replied to my story with the fire emoticon. i said "wow long time! thank u" and he replied "i know. been busy:(". i said same and he never replied. then a couple days later i posted a lot of pictures and videos on my story from a drunk girls night out. the last picture was my best friend and i asking "if anyone wants to go on a road trip with us let us know... we cute and we don't bite... too much ;) serious inquires only!". he replied and said let's do it! we talked for a little bit and he suggested a place to go... but the conversation quickly fizzled. lastly, he asked a while back when he can see me again and called me babe. i said not right now cuz i'm in a sticky situation but soon (i'm down for a fuck tbh).... he said no worries and he hopes everything is ok... then said let me know when you want to go on an adventure with me. i said "what kind of adventure?" and he said "outdoors! beach, cottage, camping etc." he is talking a lot more dry then he usually does and takes at least 10 hours to respond to a text.... but this is an interesting fuck bud....he said his friend has a cottage if i'm down to go! anyways that convo fizzled out too. he posted a cute picture of his dog to his story to which i replied "omg he's adorable 😍". he said "feel free to come visit he doesn't bite" and i said "will do when i have time! we have to go on that adventure later in july btw".... he never replied to that. a day later he asked me if i wanted to go to the beach that weekend with him. i said i was working till late but i'm going to my friends cottage later that weekend and will see if he can come too if it's a huge party. he was down... but my friend declined extra people so i told him he wasn't allowed and i was sorry. also to tease a bit but i was full on serious as well i was like "aaahhh damn! i was hoping this could work out cuz one of my friends and i are both bi and we all would have had a lit time! another time for sure!" he said "no worries! have fun. we will have fun in the sun when you come back. you can bring your friend too if you want". to which i said "she's more gay than straight but i'll see if she's down ;) lmao sorry for assuming things! i'm assuming you contacted me again for something casual?? if not that's totally fine too just trying to figure out where your mind is at!" now this is what i don't understand... his reply to that... help me figure it out please. *"it's cool not sure what i'm looking for. kinda want to see what happens. have a great weekend cutie"* **whatever that is suppose to mean** anyways later on he'd casually respond to some of my snapchat stories with saying "sexy" "👌" "🔥" and even asked "whose house is that" when i was at a friends 7.8 million dollar lake house. about a week later.... i asked "so are we ever going on that adventure or...?" to which he responded "sorry been busy. i'm going to _______ the last weekend of august if you're interested" i said "sure i'm down if work permits it! i don't want to intrude on your plans :$ i'll probably bring a friend or two, how many of you are going? but i really want to do something next weekend work is consuming my life" he said "lol that's fine. not sure my friend is planning it. if your free let's hit a trail or grab a drink. i'm free. join the club all i do is work" then... i was like "i'm down! free sometime next week for drinks? what does your work schedule look like?" he didn't open the message for two days (it's on instagram).... but hes been active and then he opened it but never replied. a week after he ghosted he wasn't watching my stories either. then the weekend we were suppose to chill he started watching everything religiously again from that point on. about a month later he replied to my story asking me where i worked, saying "damn 🔥" to attractive selfies but not progressing more for a couple months. he also realized i was having a party and asked when it was. i told him the date but he did nothing else to further inquire. i posted many stories suggesting i'm seeing others and he has watched all of those. now a month after my party and him religiously watching all my stories he saw a video of me rock climbing. he challenged me to rock climb with him at my schools gym?! he said "when you're ready i'll take you on ;)" and i said "maybe sometime soon! don't think you'll be ready though" he said "woah challenge accepted" a couple weeks later i posted a pretty modest nude to my instagram story and he said "damn! i wanna see more of you in the new year" i said "lmaaoo! we've been flaking on each other for over a year i think 😂 haha!!! but yeah let's set dates i'm game 😉 happy new years eve! x!" then he responded **"i know just waiting for the right time i guess 😂 happy new year cutie. keep up the 🔥in 2019😍". to which i replied "right?! you too babe 🔥👌". **why is he still interested?!** what does he think i think of him?! lol is he even interested?! i might have been an asshole too! let me know so i know to deal with guys differently in the future **tl;dr:** sorry for the wall of text but it's hard to summarize that^ so if you have time and are bored please read! has this happened to you? and men that do similar things, why do you behave this way? no judgement just curious!	0

when my uber driver decided to take a nap note: sorry english is not my first language. this happened to me in the morning. i booked an #uber from mumbai to pune at 4am. it predicted that it will reach pune by 6:30am. i sat in the uber car and ask the driver if it is okay to sleep as i have office in the morning and i don't want to feel like shit coz of no sleep. he said, "sir, don't worry, you can sleep and i will wake you up when we will reach the hotel". so after lying for 20 to 30 minutes in the back of the car, i dozed off. after some time, i woke up with full of sweat and looked up and outside the car only to realise that car is not moving. i looked at my watch and it was 6:00 am. i got up and looked into the front and saw.... my driver is calmly sleeping. he has parked the car on the shoulder of the motorway and put eye mask on. i looked at his phone which was showing the navigation and it was showing me estimated time of 1 hour and 32 minutes to reach my destination. it was then i realized that my driver and i have slept for 1 hour and 30 minutes 😄😄😄. i was amused and at the same time upset that my driver thought of taking a nab after seeing me sleeping. anyway, after waking him up, i reached my hotel at 8am. so it took me 4 hours to reach pune when i was supposed to cover this distance in 2 and half hours. tl;dr tifu when my uber driver decided to take a nap after seeing me sleeping in the back of the car.	0

some self reflective advice about communication i think the big issue that most people have is that they don't communicate clearly. if anything my life and the people in it have taught me it's that you must be crystal clear at all times and it's absolutely ok to ask for someone to paraphrase it back to you to ensure mutual understanding. marriage has taught me that yelling does absolutely nothing but make everyone feel bad. walking away is only good if it's for a therapeutic purpose (that which needs to be made clear first) and that picking your battles is literally your choice. there is a line from "eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" that i've always mindfully repeated to myself when i'm feeling hyperverbal or my voice begins to raise. "constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating". simple but true. words are easily ignored and thrown away but some of them stick. some of them penetrate and infect. i think it's human nature that we vent through our words because talk therapy works. i think that journaling and blogging are great ways to get that poison out of you too. it's how we talk to one another on a day to day basis that worries me. the internet allows us to become rude as we see fit. we attack strangers freely without much thought in the online comment sections yet in public we avoid one another like the plague. relationships are hard work and no matter how much effort you put into them, it isn't always returned to you in spades. learning to place your own need to communicate front and center feels like the right thing to do. i get it. this is when it gets tricky though. you do understand that emotional reactions are some of the most damaging things we can do to ourselves and others, right? it's ok if you aren't aware. i wasn't until my husband pointed it out to me. i didn't realize that i was so reactive emotionally until i started looking at what triggers me. i realized that i was feeling shame for things my parents did. how ridiculous is that? laugh, please! it's good to laugh. it's also good to not take yourself too seriously. you see, the idea that someone else is responsible for the way you feel or react is a fallacy many of us believe in. the reality is that no one can make you feel a certain way. if you are feeling a negative emotion it's because you're choosing to. that's ok! not all negative emotions are bad! obviously we feel things for a lot of reasons but know that it's ok to be upset if it's warranted. it's questioning whether or not it is in fact warranted in the first place that's the key. my parents didn't communicate well. they yelled and screamed and broke things. i remember shattered glass and blood on the walls as a child after a heated middle of the night argument that would keep my brother and i awake all night. see how easy that was? my parents set the tone for how i communicated in my relationships. ok that's one of those nature vs. nurture things sure. the thing here is this: it didn't fucking work. my moms dead and my stepdad could give a shit where i'm at. that's the past just like my childhood is. my communication skills as a 34 married woman and parent of a child with autism is my responsibility. i had to learn and unlearn and i'm still always moving forward and learning more but the key is i took a stand and decided to knock it the fuck off. someone needed to hear this too, so whomever is reading this and feeling something: knock it off and work on your communication skills. i love you 😘😘😘	0
i just feel like i need to talk. don't prioritize me or anything though.i don't know what's happening to be honest. i've been on and off really sad today and for the past week or so. today i've had a lot of suicidal thoughts, more of me kind of wanting to but really not, but i remember last year and the year before and the year before that (around this time of year usually) i had a lot of bad, frequent suicidal thoughts. and throughout the whole year too i guess, and it's probably been going on before that too, i just always figured it was normal to have them everyone now and then. i already know i can't be depressed or anything because a lot of the time i'm happy. let me back up and just say a little about myself. i'm 18 and a high school senior. i've been researching best pre med routes and possible physician specialties and even just learning human biology and other stuff whenever i'm not busy with school. i'm taking 5 ap classes and 2 honors classes but i like to think the stress of it doesn't get to me too bad. i mean, college will be a lot harder and a lot more stressful so i can't complain i guess. and if i get to med school that will be terribly stressful so i'm glad i'm working my way up. a lot of times i feel super stupid though. some classes i'm the worst in there or close to it. others i'm one of the smartest so who knows the deal. i have a girlfriend, and she's really funny and we say we love each other and everything, but whenever i talk to her about being sad she doesn't know what to say and just says something like "i'm sorry you feel like that" but i know she cares. she gets sad a lot and angry a lot though and i always do my best to talk to her and make her happy, but i feel like she blows me off a lot when she's upset and then it just brings me down. when i feel down its like i get this restlessness where i feel like i have to do something, but the only i can think of, ironically, is to kill myself (that's how about half of my suicidal thoughts are anyway, so they're not that serious) but i'm not gonna do that i don't think. it's like random things just get me down though, like a tiny thing someone says to me will slowly bring me down and down until i'm lying in bed wanting to shoot myself but knowing i can't do that. it wouldn't be fair to everyone attached to me, and i'd miss out on all my potential even if i have any. funny enough, the last time i really remember crying was like in july during an argument with my girlfriend, before that, like a year and half ago when my previous girlfriend broke up with me. so i guess it's funny how down i feel a lot but never really cry. i like to think i'm a little smart but i'm kinda slow to catch on sometimes so i fucking hope i can do something i love. i just doubt i'm depressed since most days i'm fine, and i wake up okay and just wait until a bad thought spirals and brings me down. anyway, i had to get all that off my chest, it's also slightly therapeutic. if you actually read all of this or some of this, shit, props to you. if you want to talk and you have nothing else to do id love to just chat with someone. maybe get some life experiences or just shoot the breeze. my girlfriend already went to bed and the rest of my friends aren't really people i talk to about stuff. anyway thanks for reading my jumbled mess if you did. have a great evening, and sorry if i posted in the wrong place. please don't feel obliged to help me just because i posted, you can use your time on people who need it if you need to. peace ✌️	1
i don't want to make more money than my boyfriend. my fiance (boyfriend) and i are one year into post grad life. my fiance is working as a financial advisory at a very small firm in our hometown, and i am working as an account manager at a very small ad agency in our home town. as you can imagine his salary is higher than mine by quite a bit, but i am able to earn uncapped commission. as the one year anniversary of graduation approaches i'm finding myself in a position where i could be out earning him in the next six months, and i'm not really excited about it. one reason is that he definitely worked harder in college in my opinion. there are some hard courses in marketing, but i struggled with intro finance. the second reason is that i think it's sexy that he makes more. this has nothing to do with associating money with masculinity, i just like feeling helpless 😹 thirdly i don't like the idea of being the "breadwinner". we could both live easily on just one of our salaries, but for the past year being the lower earning of the two of us i've felt like my income was supplementary. he says since he handles all of our money anyway i can just have my paycheck deposited directly into his account if i don't want to feel like the breadwinner 😹	0
s/o's sister is having a house gifted to her because she has a child. tldr: my s/o's sister is having a house purchased for her (26) and her daughter (4) because she is a single mother. i (25) grow claws when it comes to my s/o, and the uneven treatment that occurs in his family due to the granddaughter. my strong advocacy for my partner is not always wanted by him, and only damages my relationship. i will try and make the background brief, non bias, and only state facts. it may be hard not to lean in my preference, but i will try to remain to the facts. this is a story about how i love my s/o in an unhealthy amount, i am his biggest cheerleader, his lawyer, his advocate.. but i am also "s/o centralized", so i can be blind. please do not be my echo chamber, please do not only throw fuel on my fire, but please do give me some words of constructive advice. s/o- 28m, parents paid for education. has preformed well at his job, bonusing, winning awards and trips, and pulled himself out of debt. managed to save a nice nest egg for a down payment for a house during our relationship, with my small contribution as well. (he makes about 3 times my income with bonuses factored in; but salaried- double.) he drives a 2008 honda civic. the only "donations" from our family we have accepted was a grill, a nice vacuum, a new ac unit when ours broke, and generous monetary christmas gifts. we are not married, but have expressed serious future plans of it. ie.) he asked for my hand in marriage to both of my parents and told me. we are on a deed together and are in a long term committed relationship with a dog. **tldr** s/o worked very hard and purchased a house. we live together. his sister- had her daughter at 22. she is no longer with the father, but they do share custody. at the time, she was working in a hospital, but without any higher education. then she proceeded to work in a kitchen for a while. currently: she does not work, she is in community college, she is a single mother, she does not pay for her 2017 suv, her gas, her food, her daughters day care, her bar tabs, or general shopping for toys, and self-care products, hair, etc. i have not asked about the payment situation, as i try to mind my business as much as i can. however, i presume her father pays for the rent of her house, estimated at $1,200 a month. her car is either paid in full, or leased by her father. in addition to the child care facility payments, food, and other livliehood of payments. **tldr** his sister had a daughter at a young age and her father pays for her and the granddaughter father & stepmother- self made, upper middle class. totally obsessed and in love with their granddaughter, rightfully so. "cannot relax until they know that their daughter and grandchild are safe and comfortable and happy". what they lack emotionally in expression, is compensated with the love of their wallet. step mother is less guilty and more critical of this, i personally respect her a lot. i mean i respect both, but she is the more grounded one of them. so when she gives the "approval" on things, i usually think that it has been well discussed and planned. **tldr** nice people with money. not always emotionally available, but wallets are. mother- sad woman. ☹️ sad sad woman. wakes up at noon, stays up until 2am. cannot get her house in order or clean. very sensitive, but very loving. seen as irrational due to her emotional state. she wants everyone to love everyone. best described a flower child. she is cooky and off the beaten path, and is sometimes seen as "a lot". her depression has been ongoing. she is married and does have step children. she is bubbly and enthusiastic; or napping throughout the day. she is a sweet woman. she is also a realtor. she sold us our house, and now she is selling her daughter a house. often times, she sides with her daughter. i would say 95% of the time, blindly, due to the mother-daughter connection. **tldr** depressed manic woman who has a big bleeding heart, who is a realtor & often sides with daughter because "enter excuse of mental health/situation/lifestyle" that i personally have dealt with, or a friend has, etc. (essentially unfortunate things people go through but overcome).. but it is used as an explanation/excuse for current behavior context: my s/o's sister is notorious for beating the people around her down. she name calls her father, she insults her mother, and screams at my s/o each holiday about how he is a horrible absent uncle. her behavior is inexcusable; and yet my s/o's parents always find a way to excuse it. even in some instances, agree that my s/o is not around enough. in turn validating her name calling, yelling, hissy fits. ie.) we had mother's day at our new house. we got catering and bouquets for all of our moms (we have 2 moms, 2 step moms, and 2 sisters who are moms). his sister said we were selfish for not asking her what she wanted to do on her mother's day. another example is that we did not see her on easter, due to us being out of town/ not religious. easter is for her daughter, and we should be excited to see his niece look for her basket and the easter bunny. another example is when my s/o was not going to attend his nieces first dance recital because his sister had only given him less than 24 hours' notice, and we were packing to go out of town for the next day. he was a monster for considering to cancel after he had agreed (which i get, but he was also cornered last minute), and his niece is crying because he's a bad uncle. my s/o stands up for himself, obviously. in one instance, i inserted myself into it because my name got dragged in. my argument was that she treats her brother poorly and holds him to expectations that he never committed too. we have our own life, and we are happy she exists, but we are not huge family oriented people by nature. we aren't big kid people by nature. it does not mean we love any less, but we like to do our own thing. i don't think its selfish, and we make time when asked of us. but it is kind of our time to forge our own lives, as people do from their family. story: s/o's father is purchasing daughter a house. we had just purchased our house last year with our own money. s/o is purchasing daughter a house because of grandchild, security, peace of mind, a good school zone, etc. there is a laundry list of reasons why he wants to bank roll this for her. he is her father after all and is financially sound enough to do so. i think i am use to constantly having to be defensive. i am use to thinking, "well she's getting this handed to her, when you had to work for what you had, how is that fair" " your family must not value you enough" " i guess you only get rewarded in this family for laying on your back and doing nothing; but when you work hard, you get nothing". "how do you not see this as grossly unjust? the scales are not even. she is handed everything to her, and you had to work for everything". "i would rather have both of you have nothing, rather than the blatant favorism that is displayed". we don't need the financial assistance, and for that, we should be proud, and all of the cliches that come with it. self validation, independence, pride, being seen as functioning healthy adults who can take care of themselves. we went to dinner earlier in the week for my s/o's birthday. his father, step mother, sister, and niece were all in attendance. my s/o had recently won a large regional award for the 2nd year in a row. it involves a nice vacation. at his birthday dinner, rather than anyone in his family asking about it, congratulating him, anything.. we discussed how his niece got pushed by a special needs boy in school, and how his sister thinks she needs to take her out of that school. being his cheerleader, how dare his family not even give him a verbal pat on the back of a whole one minute discussion. how could they just ignore his accomplishments? they're giving his sister a whole entire house but could not take a minute out of his birthday dinner to say, congrats! tell us a little bit about the resort! listen, my s/o is humble. he does not need the accolades nor is he trying to compete for attention with a 4 year old. he did not even realize that it went completely bypassed until .. cringe.. i brought it up. even then, he did not care. he said i give him all of the validation that he needed. he said that his sisters handout is not a personal attack/slight on him. it is just a gift to her. a gift to her to hopefully better herself. i should not expect his mother to protest selling her the house. i should not foreshame his father for purchasing a house. & i should sure as hell not be upset with his sister accepting a house for the betterment of her life and her childs.. but man.. last night, did i. last night, i cried. i yelled. which is unlike me. i told him i wasn't sure if i could live a life with his sister in it, and i don't want to continuously push him away (most of our fights have been instigated by me due to my disdain of his sister). i am trying not to be blinded by my "so centralized" outlook, and realize that this is beneficial to his sister, and just because something good is happening to her, does not mean that it is an attack on him. my constant need to want to defend him, and have fair and equal treatment for him, is not something he wants. he is happy i do it, and has expressed he sees my good intentions.. but states that it does nothing to change the end result, and only wages war on his family. i have read the "rock the boat" post. how everyone runs to the side of the boat to balance it out when that one sailor starts jumping to even it out. i know his sister is that person. he does as well. he does love her, she is his sister. he does try and put her in place and remind her to be humbled and to use this for an opportunity of a life time. he reminds me not to be bitter, because he is okay. and as long as she is not being bad/mean to him, i cannot take her successes as evil. i try and exclaim how they are taking advantage, and how he is brain washed to the manipulation, and how he should not be the one always apologizing for feeling the way he does.. (when they ultimately guilt and shame him). he is a strong, and understanding man, and i respect him. i feel at times that his family abuses that, and i try to call it as i see it, but he states, it does no good. it only distances us because i get so enraged by trying to protect him. when it doesn't even bother him until i get fired up. he is use to it. he's had 28 years of this. he is numb to it. as someone on the outside for 2 years, i see it. i see it and it hurts my heart as to what his mother and father and sister do to him. i love him so much, and how dare anyone ever hurt the man i love. but the thing is.. he isn't hurt. he's happy with my love. he's happy celebrating his wins with me. he doesn't need it from anyone else. (even though he deserves his own party thrown imo). i don't know if i just need to vent. i upset him lastnight. i feel horrible. my heart is in the right place. i don't want to hurt him, and some how my compassion and unwavering fire for him managed to hurt him. i need to be more logical and cool headed. i need to do something.	0

anxiety is ruining my life sorry in advance if this becomes a wall of rambling. i won't say i have any specific anxiety disorder since i haven't been to a therapist or anything in 5 years and haven't been diagnosed with anything, but i've very obviously been having some pretty severe feelings of anxiety lately. it's mostly anxiety about my boyfriend dying. i think it started when a friend from high school died a couple of years ago. i'm friends with his girlfriend too, and i put myself in her shoes and it just freaked me out. i couldn't go on if my boyfriend died (he was best friends with the deceased). so since maybe mid 2015 then it's been on my mind every single day. i find myself doing things to prevent his death. at my old job, i once counted all the forks i was washing and told myself that whatever number it was would be the age he'd die (74, so i was a bit relieved). i'm a delivery driver now, and whenever i knock on someone's door it has to be 5 times or else something bad™️ will happen. i also have a thing about knocking on wood, which also has to be 5 times. it got pretty severe a few months ago, died down, and now i'm back to where i was before. one time, he went for a walk and i asked him to text me when he was home. after an hour he wouldn't respond. he's a notoriously bad communicator so it usually wouldn't worry me but this time i lost my shit with panic. i ended up leaving the house at 1am to drive around and look for him, sobbing and convinced i was looking for a dead body. it happened again a couple days later. not just his death makes me anxious, it's also mine, and death in general. i have chronic headaches and chest pains, which i always think is an impending heart attack or brain aneurysm. it probably doesn't help that i frequent subs like /r/lastimages and /r/watchpeopledie. i almost quit smoking a few weeks ago because i was terrified of cancer. it's weird though, sometimes i'm completely at peace with dying, but most of the time i burst into tears at the thought of it. anyway, it's driving me insane. i feel way too self aware of my mortality. i don't think i could ever follow through and kill myself, since the uncertainty of death is what scares me, but i do fantasize about it, i've had a previous attempt, and the thought puts my mind at ease. the thought of killing myself gives me a huge sense of relief and peace. i'm afraid i'll get worse and end up hurting myself. i don't want to feel like this for the next 60 years.	1
today is my birthday hey guys. so today i hit level 25 in life! i know this is a silly post, but i just moved to a new state and i'm hundreds of miles away from all my friends and family... seeking some encouragement right about now. any advice about being alone on your birthday? 😂	0

ok sorry for venting but let me be self conscious please ok?? i always feel like i have no one to talk to about this, but here's an example of something that happens a lot me: -obviously joking, talking to my friend on the phone- i'm the fattest ranger in the whole wild west🤠 my parents: stop saying that shit, you sound like an idiot, if someone who's fat hears you say that then they're gonna knock your head in, shut the hell up, etc etc etc like? obviously i wouldn't say that in front of someone who's overweight or whatever, but this was to my friend who i talk to about this kinda stuff a lot. also, maybe i'm not fat in like, the standard of everyone in the universe, but i am by my standards, i've gained like 7 pounds since last december and i'm 90 now, which by my standards, is fat. saying "omg shut up you're not even fat" isn't helping anyone lmao. let me rant	0

i [25f] trust my boyfriend [27m] but i don't trust his flirty friend. [27f] **my boyfriend [27m] and i [25f] have been together for just over a year. ** **quick summary:** my boyfriend has a woman friend who i'm not 100% sure i trust and i wanted to get some insight on if my feelings are warranted and possibly advice on how to handle this. he's never given me any reason to doubt him, he's the sweetest, most considerate man i've ever been with. i don't doubt him but i doubt her. let's call his friend lucy. lucy used to date his best friend, but they split around xmas because he was going travelling for 6 months. to my knowledge it was an amicable split and they're on great terms. lucy frequents a lot of the same art spaces my boyfriend does so they run into each other often. i would say it wasn't until the beginning of february that they started actually hanging outside of the spaces. my boyfriend never talks about lucy. i had no idea they were good friends until maybe a month ago when he started bringing her up more in conversation. when he introduced me to lucy a few weeks ago, we hit it off. i thought she was really lovely and absolutely hilarious. i ended up adding her on insta after the short hangout. i also sent her a message a week later because she was looking for show recommendations. i noticed she didn't add me back, but she read my message and never responded. didn't think anything of it. my boyfriend and i spent the weekend together with his family. i saw he received a text from her on our visit. she sent just the winking blowing kiss emoji 😘. i was impulsive and decided to investigate further. just to preface, he's openly given me his password but i've never felt the need to check. the conversation was about hanging out later in the week and she asked if she could grab a lift, he said sure and that's when she responded with the emoji. i'm a tomboy and have always had mostly guy friends. i spend a lot of time with my dudes and i'm super cool with him being friends with whoever he wants. but that response made me uncomfortable. upon further inspection when i scrolled up i saw she responded with the winking blowing kiss emoji in other conversations with him. he didn't respond to her emojis or flirtiness, just ignored it. from what i glanced the talks were friendly (nothing really flirty on his end), mostly talking about working out and art. i noticed they seem to talk pretty often, 2-3 times a week, and they see each other 1-2 times a week (they go to the gym, and grab lunch sometimes.) i see my boyfriend 1-2 times a week, we talk every other day usually. he also recently asked me if we wanted to move in together! we both don't have any urgency to move but he said he'd love to see me more and progress our relationship. my boyfriend and i have a great relationship. we have trips planned this summer, we've spent time with both our families, we support each other as much as we can and now we're moving in together soon. *an overview of my feelings:* - she's being a bit too generous with the kissing and winky emojis. - he's been mentioning her more recently, almost once a hangout, quite excitedly. - they sometimes see each other more often in one week than i see him. - she commented on his last photo post calling him, "so precious!!!" - this is a stretch but her not responding to me on social media makes me feel weird? - he often says he's told me x thing but he definitely hasn't. i think he's mixing up our convos. (ie. said he told me about a place we should checkout, definitely didn't tell me and then will go "oh maybe that was with lucy.") **am i being unreasonable with my discomfort? how do i go about monitoring this situation, specifically her? if she is crossing a line how do i approach him about boundaries?** i'm not planning on pursuing this immediately, i was thinking of arranging a big group hang soon (inviting all our friends and lucy) just so i can spend some more time her and possibly see how she acts around him. thanks folks! --- **tl;dr**: boyfriend has a woman friend who he's been spending time with, she's been sending him kissy emojis recently, when do i draw the line?	0

my dog cheered me up after a rough week :) i've been feeling really sad and anxious lately. but i finally went out of my room today. and my dog, boo, immediately came to my side. he kept booping his snoot to my leg while i had my lunch, which he usually does cause he wants some food. 😅 but after all that, i went to sit down to pet him and he immediately laid his head near my knees, then kept looking up at me periodically like he didn't want me to leave. and idk, i just really appreciated it. :) i felt like boo knew that i've been sad and i felt like he was cheering me up. that's all. i hope you all have a good day and i'd love to hear some pet stories if you have any~	0

why can't we just finally want some peace?i guess this is the most appropriate place to post this. not really looking for support or encouragement just wanted to express myself... last thursday i lost my daughter at 18 weeks pregnant. i did everything in my power to save her. to safely bring her into this world this upcoming may but life has never been kind to me. this was my fifth miscarriage. doctors didn't want to help me save her they were just worried about my "life". she was the last part of my husband i had left. she was wanted and very much loved. she was my third and last chance of wanting to stay on this miserable plane of existence. my husband was murdered 82 days ago. shot and dumped like trash in a known dumping area in his hometown. he was missing four days with no help from the police when we found his body less than 3 blocks away from his mother's house. because police and the media only care when women, children and the elderly go missing. eight months earlier we lost our son when i was 17 weeks pregnant. almost same exact way i lost our daughter, negligence by a doctor who refused to perform a cerclage before my cervix was incapable of holding a baby on its own. after they told me my daughter had no heartbeat last thursday afternoon i just stopped talking to everyone. i delivered her friday morning. they involuntarily admitted me to their fancy mental health center saturday morning. because a long with the muteness and asshole psychiatrist put in my chart the i was going to kill myself if i lost her which i never said at all and my mother attested to this because she was by my side the entire time and when they had sent both psychiatrist in i had already stopped speaking. nevertheless i was released tuesday morning because i "played nice". all three losses of my story are very my deeper and detailed than this but it's all rather too quite long and heartbreaking to type. ever since i can remember i had this feeling inside that i was not meant to be here. every night when i was a child and i learned how to pray i would ask god to take me in my sleep or take me in a chariot like he took elijah and then i would say the "now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep. 🙄 if i should die before i wake, i pray the lord my soul to take." as you can imagine at this age i didn't know why i felt this way i just did and then i saw the green mile for the first time and michael clark duncan's character finally explained what i was feeling. what everyday of my life before and after i heard those words has felt like for me. "because i want it over and done. i do. i'm tired, boss. tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. mostly i'm tired of people being ugly to each other. i'm tired of all the pain i feel and hear in the world everyday. there's too much of it. it's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. can you understand?" i felt this way before i was molested by my god-brother around that same age. continued to feel it everyday. end of my freshman year of high school my friend died by trying to hop over a moving train and slipped. classmates bullied me a few days after his funeral and i tried to commit suicide for the very first time. at 18 i was having consensual sex that turned into a vile rape. still feeling the pressure from the glass but i carried on. for my very loving family, friends and people i knew who cared about me. then i met my second husband. my best friend, my apocalypse companion. when we first met and i was planning on leaving this world for good; he was the reason i decided to stay. our marriage wasn't sunshine and rainbows. we loved each other passionately and unconditionally but we had our sometimes unbearable flaws. we we're living for each other. we both felt the same about life and didn't want to continue to press on if one of us was to leave this earth without the other. which made 2019 extremely difficult because my husband new he was going to die. he didn't know how or when but he knew that he would be taken unwillingly. and i believed him. it got to a point where he welcomed it. he tried his best to prepare me. so getting and staying pregnant was a high priority for me after the loss of our son because i wanted a piece of him, of us to live on. and it happened. i was pregnant. we we're in shock. happy and terrified but we wanted her. he wanted her. he knew she was going to be a she; she looked just like him. he tried his best to stay for us. then someone stole him from us when i was 8 weeks pregnant. his homicide is still an open investigation. these past 3 months were the worst pain i ever been through my entire life. i tried to keep her safe. some days i didn't want to wake up. weekly ob and sessions with my therapist. i fucking did my best. but my best has never been good enough. so now. i've accepted that there's nothing left for me here. there's nothing more that i want or need to do or fulfill. i don't want to heal and find more purpose. i don't want to love again. i don't want to try for the sixth time to be someone else's mother. i don't want anything anymore. it's not depression or anxiety at this point anymore. it's a choice that i'm sane enough to make. it should be my right that i shouldn't be ashamed to have. none of us have the choice of whether we want to be born. where when and who we want to be born to. we should have the right to say i'm ready to be at peace. a lot of people think it's selfish and cowardly. but it's the most selfless thing a person can do for themselves is to let go and accept. we're all going to die anyway. i think people forget that. that we're all going to die. and i rather take my own life than someone or something taking it. this isn't something that i just woke up or irrationally decided to do either. this has been my escape plan. heaven, hell, limbo, reincarnation, or nothing at all is better than being here with you all. nothing here will "get better". humans have been ruining this planet and each other since whatever you have decided to believe in. and i'm done. and i'm ok with that. and you should be too. not that it actually matters. disclaimer: don't let my let my choice be your choice. find your own peace. i also don't plan on leaving right away. i still have priorities and responsibilities i don't want to leave on my loved ones. and a part of me really wants to know who killed my husband. but when it's my time to leave i hope you all wish me peace ☮️	1

my [28f] bf [28m] said some hurtful things and idk if i can get past it. i need some insight please a couple of weeks ago, my bf and i were having a couple of drinks and i brought up that i was thinking of losing some weight (i am not overweight but i gained 10 lbs in the last 2 years). i then mentioned that my male coworker said i look good the way i am now and if i were skinnier, it would look bad. my bf then responded with "but i've seen you naked... 😂 lululemons lie!" he then proceeded to explain himself by saying how my butt is not muscular nor big... and i was just speechless and pissed because i had never said that my butt was big or nice. i was clearly hurt and upset, and he looks at me and says "look i know you're upset but there's nothing i can do about it" and he went to bed (it was very late and i knew he was tired). i couldn't sleep that night because i was really upset. the following morning, he acted like nothing had happened and asked me why i didn't sleep. i asked him if he remembered what happened last night and if he had anything to say about it. he then said "i mean... what's said is said...i can't take it back." at this point i couldn't keep it in any longer and just words/feelings vomited how fcked up and hurtful what he said was. after he then said he was sorry and i was too pissed to accept his apology especially because i didn't think he was sincere about it. we had just opened up a lot sexually/intimately. but now i felt like my body was not good enough for him and i was humiliated with his reaction. just a week before this, we got into a huge fight and broke up/got back together. he took me to his work holiday party (i get anxious with big social gatherings especially if i don't know anyone) and proceeded to ignore me the entire dinner. he sat next to his female colleague that he has weekly dinner dates with (even though they see each other 11 hours a day). he knew that i was skeptical of their one on one dinner dates after work but he has reassured me that she was excited to meet me at the holiday party. well at that dinner, she was only talking to my bf (with her own bf sitting on the other side of her that she barely spoke to), talking about inside jokes, casually touching him and laughing very loud the entire time. she barely spoke to me and the one time she did, she didn't even listen to my response. my bf was so caught up in talking to her that when he did remember that i was sitting right next to him, he had to physically move his chair closer to me (he had somehow drifted very close to her and far from me) and tell me that i had to try a certain dish that came out. only to go back to his conversation with her. all of his other coworkers were busy talking about their inside jokes and work, it was hard for me to fit in a conversation with anyone. i was pretty livid after that dinner because i felt humiliated and like the child that the parent had to bring to the adult table. afterwards when i told him how i felt about that night, he said he acted like that because he was upset that i wasn't excited about the party even though i told him that i was nervous. anyways this is getting so long and i'm writing this out on my phone at work. pretty much i'm asking for some insight/advice about whether or not i should give my bf another chance? am i overreacting? he really says he's sorry but i can't get his words out of my head. the more he tries to explain why he said what he said, the worse the entire thing gets. please help. this is written poorly and i'm sorry.. i'm a terrible writer and my thoughts are all jumbled up. tl;dr: my bf said some hurtful things. idk if i am overreacting and whether or not i should give our relationship another try.	0
how do guys like to be flirted with over text/snapchat? i've kinda realized that i'm a little mean to the boy i like. we are friends as of rn but we used to hookup a while ago and nothing serious ever came of it. he calls me pretty and stuff but he's really not over his ex dumping him so i'm helping him through that bc he is depressed (😔). i'm kinda bad at giving compliments/flirting but i want him to know that i really like him. unfortunately i'm the type of girl who teases/is mean to a guy when i like him but thats hard to do over text without looking like a bitch. anddd ive kinda been a bitch to him unintentionally bc sometimes it's rlly hard to hear the guy you like talk about how he's depressed over his ex. do guys really appreciate it when you say he looks nice/good morning texts, etc? i know that sounds obvious but if there are other things they prefer more i would appreciate hearing that too.	0

i hate myself sometimes everyday i'm on snapchat and i see many stories of couples together with the same bullshit like "omg 4 months everything is so great with you❤️❤️" i really feel envy about those guys because they are all attractive and probably have decent social lives while i'm at least a 3/10 and do nothing but play on the pc and pet my dogs which are the only things that keep me somewhat happy. why couldn't i be that good looking and be less of a recluse. i hate how everyday is the same. nothing excites me anymore. i just wanna hug goddamit that's all i ask for.	0
tifu by robbing myself and missing the train today i fucked up by basically robbing myself (if you count money being snagged out of your account in a sketchy af way and pretend someone else did it). i was going to get a busticket for me and my spouse, and i accidentally inserted the wrong info for my card but the transaction went through nonetheless.i did not know this was possible and got semi freaked out and because of this we got distracted and hopped on the wrong bus (there were 2 busses parked that were getting ready to run, we were supposed to hop on number 2 that went to the train station and ended up on number 1 which went in the literally opposite direction), and are currently on our way to an unknown destination in a huge ass city we don't know anything about and our train back home left 10 minutes ago 😅 at least we get some sightseeing😂 tl;dr: bought a ticket with the wrong card information, got distracted by that even being possible and hopped on the wrong bus which made me miss my train	0

accidentally sending a snap about a person, to that person.. it wasn't anything terrible, but i still feel like a total asshole for making it known to my friend that i was mildly talking shit. so i currently live in fl, but before that tn and before that mi. it's finally getting to be that time of year where it cools down and starts to feel amazing, and i go from despising florida to just disliking it. i love this 55-75 degree weather. it's absolutely perfect. well, i'm at work this morning chatting with my friend on our company chatroom, and she mentions that is was really cold this morning (55-57ish) and i joke with her a bit saying "cold?! ha! that's cute." but then i go on snapchat to send the conversation to a couple of my best friends, who live in alaska and vermont respectively, because i'd figure they'd get a kick out of it as much as i had. well, muscle memory and habit kicked in, and i selected my work friend's name in snapchat as well and sent it. my heart sank... i immediately messaged her on our chatroom and let her know (i figured it'd be one of those, 'better to hear from me first' things..) she had only replied to respond to something we were talking about previously, but nothing else since. usually she does go radio silent throughout the day or take a while to respond because work, but she hasn't said anything since and my anxiety has kicked in thinking she hates me now and i feel like a shitty friend 🙃 tl;dr: i accidentally sent a snapchat of a conversation i was having with a friend to mildly make fun of it, to that friend.	0

i think i might hang myself later.my dad and i got in a fight over a candle...he didn't like the smell of it (it's just cinnamon) and told me not to light it anymore, because i would fall asleep and burn the house down. 🤷‍♂️ despite me never laying in bed when i light it. i watch tv or browse the internet, so the candle is always in site. i light it because it makes my room smell better. it smells humid or musty, since it's all hardwood floors. i told him i wouldn't fall asleep, while it was lite and we got to arguing. he said i was useless and that i just mooch off of him. he called me lazy because i sleep in. i told him that i haven't been the same after i lost my job. he just blamed me anyways for sleeping in. he complained about how i haven't found a job yet and that i suck all his money away. he also told me to get over feeling sad. so i guess i'll get over being sad by hanging myself. i am planning to hang myself in my closet with a belt. i may leave a note to him saying i'm not going to be wasting his money anymore. i'll do it later in the night, so if he comes in later (until he goes to bed) he won't find me in the process of it. hopefully, i'll be dead soon, that way i'm not wasting his money.	1

what do you use as a bookmark? hi fellow book lovers! after many years of drooling over the folio society catalogue i finally pulled the trigger and ordered some books which i'm super excited about. since this will be my first taste of a higher end book edition i started wondering if there are any do/don't in terms of bookmark usage? mostly in terms of potentially damaging the paper. since i spent so much money on these books i want to care for them as much as possible within reason. also, are there any companies that sell high end bookmarks that anyone could recommend? i typically just use a scrap of white paper but it would be nice to have something nice to go with my pretty books 😂 what do you guys use/suggest? thanks in advance!	0

researching saxophone mouthpieces while in a lecture hall. this happened yesterday, but yadda yadda... i'm a music major at my university focusing on classical saxophone performance. i love that saxophone like a child and i'm pretty much always looking up new products and accessories to make myself sound as good as possible. yesterday i was in my english lecture and people were presenting their slide show projects. i know it's a bit rude to do this, but i got bored and didn't really need to pay attention so i went on amazon and started looking for new mouthpieces. i've used a v16 for a few years now, but that's more of a jazz mouthpiece. not really the mouthpiece you want for a concert band setting and such. now i'm not sure if you all know what mouthpieces look like, but [here's](<url>) a picture of one of the mouthpieces i was looking at. this will come in handy later in the story. while in the lecture, i came up with a few ideas of the type of mouthpiece i wanted to try out. i drove to a nearby sam ash after class and picked up a brand new s80 alto mouthpiece for 160 bucks, and headed to concert band. during band one of the clarinets i'm only slightly aquatinted with tapped me on the shoulder to show me a snapchat from her phone. someone took a picture from a few rows back in the lecture of my laptop screen and on the screen was a google images style row of pictures of mouthpieces. from that far away, they just looked like phallic black objects. the caption was "yooo this girl really be looking up dildos in class 💀" i was a bit mortified. i haven't had that class again but a lot of people saw that snapchat and passed it around. pretty much the whole marching band here saw it too, that's about 300 people in just the band. i don't even know how many people saw it that's not in the band. this better not be my college legacy though.... tl;dr- i looked up saxophone mouthpieces during class and someone took a picture of my screen from far away thinking it was dildos, and probably 1000 people saw it on snapchat.	0
eating some pie. obligatory took place a few months ago. i posted it on another subreddit, but that subreddit doesn't exist anymore. background: my boyfriend and i live together. his grandmother passed away at the beginning of august and he needed some alone time, so he went away to his family's lake house for a week alone. .... so at the end of the week my boyfriend's friends and i visit my boyfriend at the lake house. as i'm unpacking my things, i notice 1/2 a cherry pie on the table that had gone virtually untouched since the wake about a week and a half earlier. fast forward to later that night. we're all sitting around the campfire talking. i'm really hungry because i had worked a 10 hour shift at mcdonald's and hadn't had anything to eat all day. because fuck mcdonald's food. and then. a n d t h e n. i remember the pie. the sweet, sweet cherry pie that had been neglected on the table. 'no!' i think to myself. 'i will not eat the pie. i'll have something healthy later.' so i forgot about it. for about five minutes. i excused myself to used the restroom when i just saw it sitting there in all its glory. my mind was telling me no. but my body. my body was telling me yes. 'i'll just have a small piece.' i manage to convince myself. wrong. one bite turned into two, and two turned into three, and then my mchunger™️ kicked in and the entire pie disappeared. i was a little disappointed, but that sure hit the spot. besides, it probably wouldn't be missed, right? it was neglected for over a week! ha. i threw away the box, went about my business, and went back to the campfire. when i returned, my boyfriend was talking about the funeral and all the food that was left over from the wake. "hey" pipes up friend #1. "isn't there a pie on the kitchen table from the wake? i was eyeing that earlier." "yeah!" chimes in friend #2, "we should have some later!" so the group decided that after they finished their drinks, they would dig into some of that scrumptious cherry pie. the cherry pie that was no longer there. the cherry pie that i had just devoured. i excuse myself to take a shower and book it up to the house. i run to the kitchen, fish through the trash can, grab the empty pie box, run out to my car, and hide the box under my car seat. i run back inside and jump into the shower. when i finish showering and changing into my pjs, i step out of the bathroom to see the guys ripping apart the kitchen. "i know it's here somewhere." my boyfriend states. "it was on the table." he then sees me. "rachagainstlemachine, have you seen the pie?" i choose to play dumb. "what pie?" "the pie that was on the table." i go over to the table and move some food around, pretending to look for it. "what flavor was it?" "cherry." friend #2 answers. my boyfriend then makes his way over to the trashcan. i nearly faint as he starts sifting around the top of it. "i don't know where it is, sorry guys." my boyfriend states, putting the lid back on the trashcan. "rachagainstlemachine probably ate the entire pie while she was up here." friend #1 joked (this is sort of a running joke among the group because i'm really short and scrawny and usually eat like a bird. i don't think he actually knew that he was stating straight f a c t s.) "haha yeah you caught me." i joke (but not really lol) so eventually they settle on making nachos and the night goes on. i needed up throwing the pie box away in the mctrash when i went to work on monday. tldr: everyone in household ignores a pie for a week. i eat the pie. all of a sudden, everyone wants the pie. there is no more pie.	0

how to tell if he really likes me him and i are both 19. i've been talking to him on and off for a few weeks now. one thing kinda bothering me about him is that he always comments on my looks (always positive comments). but i'm wondering if he's only trying to get in my pants and doesn't want anything else. he did ask me out the day i met him (at uni) but i said no. i might be overthinking this, but that's only cos i can never meet someone and instantly think 'oh i'd like to date them'. if i like a person, it's usually after talking to them a few times and after i've had different kinds of conversations with them. i just don't want him to like me only for my looks. how do i find out what's the deal? i thought maybe next time he comments on my looks i could say something like 'haha do you even think about anything else' but i don't wanna sound rude. idk what to do... tldr : talking to this guy i might like. he comments (always positively) on my looks multiple times every conversation. how do i find out if he only cares about my looks? ps so far he's called me beautiful, pretty, cute, hot. i think that's all the words in his vocabulary 🤷‍♀️ or maybe he's desperate (could he be?)	0
if you have a telescope, jupiter and saturn will be really close together over the next few days if you like stargazing 😳 if you're on the east side of north america like me it'll appear in the evening. jupiter appears as the brighter object, west of earth's moon, and you might notice saturn slightly above jupiter, but dimmer (or you might not, they might appear as one) so that means, with an average telescope on a lower power, you can get both planets in a single frame at the same time! you can see the 4 largest moons of jupiter as well and probably a few of saturn's too (maybe) if you look closely, all in the same frame.	0
inner demons it's been 6 days since i left my mother's house. it was the hardest thing for me to do, but it had to be done. i packed some of my belongings and left the keys on her dresser. she verbally abuses me every single day to the point it made contemplate suicide and i don't need her negative energy around me. i want positive people who will uplift me and i wasn't getting that at all. there have been a constant battle with me and my mother for years now. her stealing my income tax check and trying to cash it behind my back, her renting out my with while i was out shopping for a birthday dress. i came back a couple of hours late to see some dude on my bed that i've never seen before. my clothes and all of my personal belongings still in the room. not to mention her playing favoritism toward my overgrown brothers. they are basically the husband she never had. now i have been in a women homeless shelter for nearly 1 week and it is horrible here. i get told when to wake up, when to go to sleep, when to eat, when to use the bathroom. i find myself crying every single night asking myself why is this happening to me !??!?????!!! i've contemplated suicide ever since. i feel so worthless i feel broken because a parent is suppose to be your backbone, your protector, your best friend, selfless and my mother is the opposite of what a good mother should be and this makes me resent her a lot. these negative emotions that i'm feeling is literally eating me alive. i feel so destructive to the point where i can't even find a reason living. i can't see a brighter future. i crave death everyday single day and it's just constant battle with me and my demons and i think one day they will unfortunately get the better of me 😭	1
i'm getting my first "real" tattoo in a few weeks and i'm really excited like the title says, i'm getting the line work done my first "real" tattoo on april 23rd. i've got 6 tattoos already, but they're all small or just spur of the moment "why not" pieces. i finally decided to invest the time and money into getting some truly meaningful artwork on me that i truly love. i just wanted to share that with someone 🙂	0
i've reached that point again.i told my therapist three weeks ago that i had this unnerving feeling. i couldn't make out why but it's best described as a waiting for the other shoe to drop. i was finally in a place in my life where i can do and afford to do things that interest me, making enough that i didn't get food stamps (after three years of being off and on/mainly on), saw a flight to amsterdam in februaryfor a cheap price so i even booked that. was pulled into hr over an incident and basically since i wouldn't lie to involve two other coworkers they were going to fire me. i opted to resign and left. i just can't in good faith fuck someone else's livelihood up, even at the expense of my own. i can't even fathom going out of the country anymore if i don't have cash. was planning to get passport made this week. move out of my sister's house (⭐) by january 1. start working on my credit. now i'm back to square one. unemployed, depressed (with the slightest inkling of optimism), and suicidal given i just lost my cushy $3200 a month after taxes unskilled labor job. i'm never gonna make that kind of money again. i'm just wanting to sleep forever. sleeping's the only time i'm ever at peace.	1

gf sexting a former colleague, where to from here? so, my gf(f30) and i (m41) have been dating long distance for around 20 months. and it's been amazing. we live in different countries, but with my job i get to travel to see her for a fortnight at least every month. her job doesn't have much flexibility, so i'm the one who does the travel. i was previously married and, post divorce i didn't expect to fall head over heels ever again. but i have. hard. so, a few months ago i noticed her sending what appeared to be a bit of a flirty text to a guy listed as "***work hubby" at the time i told myself i was being paranoid. she's previously explained that this guy is a friend and former colleague from her previous job (in another country), but nothing romantic. cut to last week. she went to shower and left her phone unlocked on the bed and open on her messages, and i saw she'd sent him another, flirty text. i know i absolutely shouldn't have, but i picked up the phone and read the text thread. i only flicked through, but there were recent (within the last few months) sexts. she'd told him things like "i had a sex dream about you 😘😘😘" and "i miss climbing into your bed at night for late night cuddles" as well as sending him (clothed) selfies. the same selfies she sends to me. he has also replied, telling her how hot the dream was, as well as him missing sneaky cuddles and loads of voice notes, selfies and a dick pick. i confronted her about it. she was very apologetic (tears etc), but insists that he's just like one of the girls (just to clarify, he's straight), and it was inappropriate, but it doesn't mean anything. she said that the messages look awful out of context, but it's always been a light-hearted, flirty relationship, but nothing more. and she acknowledges that it's now inappropriate in a relationship. a final kicker is that she's recently mentioned that she's thinking of extending her contract for another year, rather than moving to live with me as we'd previously discussed. and in the messages, he's now talking about moving to the same city as her next year. we agreed to move on from the sexts, but i'm having a really hard time processing it. any advice as to what to do from here? i want to rebuild the trust, but how? i really do love this girl, and i want to make it work tdlr: girlfriend sexted an ex-colleague, where to from here?	0

a reason to be proud seeing this subreddit makes me smile, anyone that posts here should be proud of themselves, instead of taking the easy but unsatisfying way out, you've all decided to seek help, maybe some people are too shy or scared to talk about suicide with people in real life, so it is understandable to talk about this anonymously on the internet. i've seen some poeple here say that others talking to them won't make them feel better and that this subreddit is useless, thing is, you might not feel comfort talking to strangers, the point is to see some light, a bit of hope, some ideas of motivations and goals. i hope you can all find a reason to give life another chance.✌️🙏👍	1

i'm still sad but i'm happy i didn't do it. i've honestly been through a lot in my life so far and i'm only 18, but this year was by far the worst. i've had so many breakdowns and i was four pills in last week until my friend talked me down and i'm so happy i didn't do it. i wish i could be stronger because my parents were never there for me but i've built such a strong family with my friends now. i'm so grateful to have these people in my life but i can't help but feel a sadness in the back of my mind that doesn't want to be here. i wish i could always be around them because they honestly lift me up so much. i'd probably be homeless or still addicted to perks and possibly dead if it weren't for them. i take the good things for granted too much and get stuck in my mind. i'm scared if what i'll do in a bad time but i'm so happy i haven't succeeded so far. sorry this is kind of all over the place i'm just feeling so many things right now. but for all of you feeling like this that don't have that support system. please remember there will always be websites like this and hotlines that can help you. nothing has to end. there will always be people willing to help because you matter and you deserve to keep on living and growing. ❤️❤️❤️❤️	1

girlfriend showering with her bff dear, so its a complicated story but i need some help! my girlfriend of three months told me in the beginning of our relationship that she showers together with her best female friend. and she asked me if i had a problem with it and i told her that i find it weird being we are in our 20's. she says it's something they are doing since they have been little kids. the thing that bothers me is that her best female friend once had sex with here while they where both high on weed after a party a few years back. but she says it was a one time thing. she promised me that she wont be showering again together. so a few days after we agreed on that she showed me a screenshot of her friend asking her to shower together again and she told me she said no to her friend out of respect for me. so today i've found out that her beste female friend asked her a few days back to shower together again and her reply was "uhhm sure 😳👀" i found out thru her phone but she doesnt know that i know im furious that she lied to me because she also explained to me that she also likes to have sex with girls, but thats pure sexual nothing more she says. im not fine with her doing that and im not fine with the way how i found it out. so what should i do? how should i confront her?	0

m(20) do i give her the time of day? basically there's a girl(20) i really liked, i know her through a friend at university(college for americans). i messaged her on instagram to basically shoot my shot, but she didn't entertain me in the slightest. i don't upload a lot on instagram so there's not loads of pictures of me, but i've been hitting the gym a lot harder and taking care of myself so i look and feel better. so fast forward like 2 months and i finally meet this girl in person for the first time at a party, she tells all her friends she thinks i'm cute, funny, good looking and in shape, she's been nonstop messaging me since we met the other night, and she says she really likes me, do i give her the time of day or not? i think she only likes me because of how i look, since she didn't seem interested when she didn't really know how i looked 🤷🏿‍♂️ tldr: this girl likes me because i'm in shape now and i don't know if that's the type of girl i want to be with	0
dear dad *dear dad* *i guess me calling you dad would shock you. i always called you by name because mum forced it on me.* *i remember you admitting you'd punched her in the face. i remember you admitting to your criminal record. i remember that honesty was something you valued highly. and even though i don't condone domestic abuse or violence, i know how twisted and cruel mum can be. i understand.* *i don't remember you that well. after what happened i blocked you out. i was obsessed with being strong and cold. i never spoke of you, well i never initiated it to anyone for years.* *but i do remember us going out to the zoo. to the swimming baths. to the cinema. to blackpool. caravans. i remember that i was too damaged and mentally ill to form a relationship with you. i desired the closeness but because of my mothers interference and how she poisoned me against you... i guess i was too young to even understand what i was doing.* *but i miss sharing a bed. i still remember being 5 years old and us arguing about who would sleep on the couch. i felt bad and refused to let you sleep on the couch whilst i got the bed. eventually we were both too stubborn to do anything so we shared the bed. that was our tradition, until the end.* *i'd wake up to see you looking at me. you had the most beautiful blue green eyes. sometimes you'd hold my hand as i slept. it happened quite often. we'd lay awake each night in the dark. holding hands lying on our backs and we'd just talk. near the end you seemed to be getting depressed. sleeping a lot. but i still would sometimes wake up with my hand sweaty from yours and your face inches from mine. even when i would wake up to see your eyes shut, you quite often would wake up a moment later and stare into my eyes. i haven't ever seen so much love in someone's eyes that way before. i never saw anybody look at me the way you did, i doubt anybody would love me anywhere near as much as you did. i will never forget it. it breaks my heart every time i recognise that expression in other fathers of young girls* *i remember at 12yrs old when i got my first bra and period you talked about no longer sharing a bed. i vehemently refused to sleep apart and so we continued our tradition.* *i know bits about you now. how you desired to be loved. how much you fought at court to see me. how much you loved me and wanted me to love you the way other kids love their parents. that's why you got engaged to that cunt who hated me.* *at 18 you met a woman you loved with a young boy. you were a kind thoughtful man. well known for being generous and would do anything for a stranger. i saw numerous times you doing selfless things for strangers. you were incredibly kind. you did a year or so in prison for breaking into a supermarket one night and stealing. you gave the money to a friend hoping he'd give her the money. he didn't. when you came out of prison you continued to support her and your "son". you only broke up i believe because she cheated on you. as a teenager you stayed with a woman, went to prison and helped raise a boy who wasn't yours. i won't pretend you were a saint because you weren't, but you certainly wasn't bad* *anyways* *you had just turned 42 earlier that month, and i was 12. it was 2010 and you were in your long term girlfriends house. it was around 1am and you apparently heard a noise in the back garden. you were brave and loyal and caring. careless and impulsive, you did what many people would do for somebody they loved, or thought they loved. you tried to protect them, you opened the door.* *that was when you were murdered. september 2010. you were hit in the head with some pipe. then stabbed in the heart. that was you... over. gone.* *your fiance went into your flat later that day. if i remember correctly she took your mattress and your washing machine. she also took pictures you wanted me to have, other sentimental things that were of no value. to spite my family.* *i was a mentally ill 12 year old in a special needs school who cut themselves and had attempted suicide 10 months earlier. i came home to see my paternal grandmother with my maternal grandfather. mum was crying. my grandmother explained what happened. i got into my mother's lap and cried after. * *a few were arrested. we pushed for the police to do more. i found out you sold cannabis, though only to people you knew well. after we complained again the police threatened to release the information about your criminal activity to the public.* *when a parent is murdered the child receives money when they get older. if that parent has a criminal record then you aren't entitled to it i wasn't.* *it took weeks for the funeral to take place because of the evidence. i became extremely close to one of your brothers.* *the case was shut soon after. nobody was ever caught. it's still unsolved and will always be unsolved. i'm sorry dad, i wish there was justice for you. but there never will be. i'm so so sorry* *life got harder, dad. my boyfriend sexually assaulted me at 13. i held a man whilst he died of a heart attack. i continued to cut myself. i overdosed again at 13. at 15 my mother threw me out and your brother took me in and raised me. we're so close these days. he is like a father to me. he's not able to show love like you were. but now i can express love. i wish i had been able to do this whilst you were alive. it kills me to think you didn't feel loved by me before you died. the guilt and self hatred and loneliness is so bad that it took years for me to face it* *i admit i started abusing drugs at 15. i'm a drug addict now at 20. i have more than 300 scars over my body. my legs, arm, shoulder and chest.* *i also got piercings. i have 10 currently. if you knew where some of them are you'd cringe 😉. i don't think you would of liked the woman i've become. but i think you'd understand why i'm such a mess. i miss you so much. i lost the only happy optimistic person ever. my life has a permanent dullness that i need to escape from anyway necessary* *i know if you had been alive you wouldn't of let my mum put me into a care home. you made the right choice asking your brother to take me in. he's treated me so well.* *i'm 20 now. i have a boyfriend of 4 months. i'm unemployed and on benefits, but i know that's not forever. i'm getting my own place soon. i plan to make a little place in my flat dedicated to you.* *i love you with all my heart. i know you loved me too. your murder broke me and changed me completely. i'll forever be devastated.* *but i'm getting better. one day i hope i can be the kind of woman you'd be proud to call your daughter. i'll be bringing my boyfriend around to your grave again around your birthday. nobody should celebrate their 50th alone.* *love from e*	1

scrambled mind first let me start by introducing myself, i'm 15 years old and go to a boarding school, last year around mid october i stopped smoking synthetic weed for good after 9 months of everyday use. i was suspended because of it from school and the drug has ruined my brain, in the next paragraph i'm going to say what i feel like right now a year later and if you could include in your comments which parts are normal parts of puberty and which parts are not normal, also advice would be helpful 😊. so far i feel less detached from reality but still very detached, it's as if everything is fake, i can't socialise any more unless i analyse the persons body language and i'm still not good because i'm still learning how to socialise from scratch, it's as if i'm a baby. i feel no hope in life because my brain is so fucked, i have the sense that in my mid twenties i'll end up killing myself because i would have made it no where in life, i also have no empathy any more, what used to anger me doesn't, i'm emotionally flat in other words. i have conversations in my head with more than one conscious, also my personality can change based on the situation, basically i negotiate with the consciousness in my head and depending on the situation one can take over. people in my school are also psychopaths and keep using there body language to manipulate my subconscious into thinking bad things so i do what they want without them having to talk... this doesn't help either, i've replaced my sythetic weed hole with exercise, mdma and alcohol. also i can hear things in my head sometimes and be in a very bad mood randomly then in s good mood, i am also eating a lot more healthy to try detox. no one knows about this. this is the first time i've told people since i'm anonymous. if you got through this long paragraph thank you for your time and decent comments will be valued and read,	1
i dont know anymorei don't know how much i have the energy to write plus i won't probs care abt grammar that much rn so i am sorry for this mess. i have been mildly derpressed my whole childhood, i have always been masculine which i have been bullied about at school and home. things got worse around sixth grade (abt 12yo) when i stopped getting any "entertainment" from my usual things like playing and school and tv etc. around this time i also realized i was fat and started to struggle with weight management. i started to lose weight "very unhealthily" basicallt eating almost nothing. and i got to a weight where i'm now able to hide my slight chubbyness with clothes. this all went unnoticed by my family since my sister started cutting and being suicidal and i didnt want to add to that. fastforward to eight grade(14-15yo) i started to struggle with anxiety and my depression gpt a bit worse. during ninth grade anxiety gpt even worse and depression with that. 16yo i didnt have anxiety issues anymore but my depression got alot worse, quickly. during this time i was also manipulated by a "friend" who at the end ended up forcing me to some sexual stuff. thia destroyes me completely. i started smoking and walking on roads wishing that a car would hit me or walking on train tracks etc. i started having some self harming tendensies. summer came so things easiet up coz i got away from the person who manipulated etc me. at this time my depression was at its worse i changed schools during the summer coz i couldnt go back to my old school because of this person. around this time my dpression was abt the same as earlier but i managed it better and didnt do selfharm stuff. now school started around 3months ago. i have not gotten any better and for abt 3weeks it has started getting rly bad again. i keep fantasizing dying but rn im at that point that i wont do it coz i dont want to hurt my family. kind pf waiting for my self to stop being a pussy so i dont need to suffer anymore. the thing is that i havent rly told anyone how bad it is because i cant, its completely against my personality and i just cant. plus i dont want to cause negativitt to my friends etc life. also around 14-15yo i was hopeful like "oh but it wioo get better", i still try to force myself to think that but im definitely losing hope, things have just gotten worse during the last 5years and i dont know how long i'll be able to not break and honestly this even scares me a bit. i dont even know the point of this post but i needed to tell someone and i thought that maybe itll feel better after writing (+i cant write to my friends etc) but like i said im just really, really done. i have been so depressed these last three weeks and the only time i didnt feel completely shit was when i was drinking but i'm starting to have problems with that too(+basically starting to have some unhealthy "habits"). i dont see any hope in the future and i just dont want to live anymore. i cant do anything, i dont remember anything (i feel like i keep dissociating all the time or something like that idk, but i cant remember even the whole day without rly having to think abt it and maybe even but the either). i cant sleep, but im always tired so i just lay in bed. i cant eat because it makes me wanna throwup and just the thought of eating is causing an uneasy feeling in my stomach. i cant study but i keep going to classes so my parents dont notice my illness (i dont live with them but they got notified since im under 18 if i dont go to class). basically i cant rly do anything and i just keep feeling worse and crying all the time. thanks for reading if someone did (also i wrote this also because if i get worse and end up taking mylife(not planning rn) maybe my family will find this from my phone and understand a bit) i guess i just need some encouragement or something to keep living idk, please something positive. (new to reddit so if this breaks rules or something and is in wrong sub or something, just delete idk) ty💕	1
only a few chapters in to seven blades in black and it's really annoying me. i'd probably love this book more if the main character doesn't make it a point to remind you that she's a murdery asshole who everyone hates every other paragraph. it's very much a case of telling instead of showing, and i hate that. my eyes are pointed at the ceiling more than the book from rolling so often. i get it, you're a bad bitch, you're unlovable, broken, damaged™️, and you perpetually smell of bo and disappointment. i don't need constant reminders telling me these things, because your interactions with the world and it's populace can speak for itself.	0

up next: my sorrow and suicide i spent too long trying to make that title. might even title that to my 35,000+ word suicide note if anyone who knows me is reading this, sorry. if you're reading this after i'm dead. well fuck. i fucking done it tho. but yeah sorry for being dead and all. there is a tldr summary near the bottom. so just like the hundreds (if not thousands) of people that come here daily to vent their misery and sorrows i am too joining that mass of people. peace and love to all of you posting and to all of those that reply to these, you're a gem of society i wish i could've met someone with a heart as big as yours. so let's get right into it, i'm killing myself. well at least try again. if i fail at that. i'm trying again and a fucking again till i am fucking dead. you see killing yourself here in the u.k. isn't exactly the easiest without the knowledge of how to make powerful homemade explosives or be in possession of a firearm capable of ripping my head off in shot, like a basic slug based shotgun would be much appreciated if anyone has one for me to borrow. but regardless i'm killing my self via hanging or deep lacerations to my brachial artery. both hurt a lot. but it will be worth it. so a little bit about me: yup, just a typical middle class 18 year old white male. nothing all to special. kinda insecure too. but who ain't? suicidal since 11. first attempt was at like 12, but i didn't do my research so it wasn't all that much. about 13 attempts since then. ( ok shut up i suck at killing myself. these attempts are more or less me failing or me testing techniques for this very planned moment) i had extremely homicidal thoughts. like 2017, i would've killed people if i had a gun. but that's not me no more. so yeah. i'm that kid in your school that wants to shoot up the school. but im over that now. the homicidal thoughts are gone. i cleaned up my room and ordered my life. jung told me too look inside and so i did. so why am i killing myself? 2 key reasons -loneliness -burden to society/family yes, very common reasons. loneliness the key reason why i'm ending it all. i've spent every week since 10 (when suicidal thoughts started) that "next week could be better, you may just meet someone who will change your life" 8 years later and nope not really much of a difference. met 2 people that impacted my life but not enough to stop the overwhelming urge to neck myself. yeah sure i've got friends. good group worth of them. yet i still feel alone. i don't speak with them irl often at all. like maybe once every two months. they don't really care all that much anyway. they all have other friend groups so it's okay for them. i had a close friend group. me and this one girl became really close friends. which gave me some hope. but they at uni now. so i lack any compassionate friendship and lack any current or previous intimate relationships. i am really alone. i feel really alone. i feel unwanted. because i tried i really did. the constant nightclubbing i thought would've at least have met someone that would've been good to me. although a few people i did meet there was amazing nothing really became of them. i'm frustrated by this loneliness, i see everyday awful people with great close friend groups. i see guys that treat women like shit but some how still appear "attractive" and they blast through multiple relationships easily. all my trying has kinda got me no where. i'm sick of having to feel alone, having not one person just message you, not having one person just check on you (even after you've emotionally supported them through the lowest moments of their lives) not having one person just randomly hit you up and ask if you want to do something. am i doing something wrong here? i'm not a bad person at all. i'm trustable and i know this because an unbelievable amount of people open up to me. i don't do anything to purposely hurt people, yet i feel like that's all i do. i'm protective but i know not to attack others freedom, so i don't. the loneliness is awful. especially because i'm an extrovert. so, one argument to this: "keep trying, you will get there eventually. try a new tactic" yup... still waiting. i just don't want to be alone for this long anymore. i don't want to be constantly empty. i get it. this sounds ridiculous. "how can he say he's lonely, he's got friends. how can he say he really feels alone when he has had close emotional bonds with girls he's liked, yeah sure it's not a relationship but it's still better then what most of the people on here have" yeah i get it. it sounds selfish. maybe treatment? eh i'm on herbal medication to treat my lows. not seen a doctor about it tho. will i? depends? i'm gunna test my close friends and see how much they really care. if not i'll just kill myself right there. might crack out tinder and see how that goes. 😂 probably awful. no i'm not living a self fulfilling prophecy. that's what the incel community seems to suffer from. burden well, i don't exactly work. well not yet anyway. give it a month or two and i'll be doing that. so yeah currently a financial burden on my parents. which sucks yeah. i know they would prefer me alive but it would be better if i was dead. i mean yeah the funeral gunna cost abit. yeah it's gunna be abit traumatic to who finds my corpse. but i'm doing this for me! i can't suffer anymore. i fully understand all consequences of suicide. i understand it may even burden others lives more then it already is. but still. i've had lots of experiences with family attempted suicides and multiple friends too. so back to the burden, when i'm out with my emotionally close friends i find myself overprotective, like if a guy is going to try and come up and hit on my friend i'm gunna let em know to fuck off or i'm caving your skull in. i always ensure their safety. which to the most part has been a good thing, although not all the time. so i can come across as abit of a cunt if you try and fuck around with my friends and i know i get respected for that. it's just that i feel like doing that makes me into a awful person to go to social events with. like the other day, friend has a date guy coming out. so he sees a drunk girl that he knows that kinda likes him. so being this guy is clearly looking to get laid, i refuse to trust him around this girl on his own. because this is the best possible exploit for what he wants. so throughout this entire night club event i followed this guy around who was still with my friend. who was still being all mr closey with abit arm wrapping on the 5'2 girl which i know she don't find comfortable. this guy is 24 and she's 18 btw. so i eventually get this guy on his own. i look this fucker in the eye and tell him to leave of or otherwise i'm gunna fucking kill him. i felt at ease with him after that. because he completely acknowledged what i was doing. we respected each other after that. but yet even though i felt like i did a good thing it felt bad because i still stuck with them the entire night even though i clearly shouldn't be overarching into someone else's potential relationship. i've never felt so awful after that. essentially everything i think i'm doing good eventually peaks into me doing something bad. this can apply to multiple anecdotal story's i've got. so i fell like if i was just gone i wouldn't fuck up anyone's nights ever again. i won't hurt other people's emotions anymore. tldr? well, i feel empty, lonely and the world is better off without me. i want something to fill my emptiness but in all my tryings i feel as though i end up damaging people. so, i've got one thing i'm looking forward too. my friend comes back from uni next month. so we could possibly resume the night clubbing together. or i kill myself next week and if not then. once october ends i end it. i will have literally nothing after that. it's odd being the one looking for help and an a kind comment. it's usually the other way around. but it happens aye. im sure you had better things to do then read a lonely mans reasons for suicide. so thanks for reading. ❤️	1

stress, dealing with death, and lack of self-worth: you're not alone! i just joined suicidewatch a week ago and i was reading through a lot of the posts on here, many of which were made by people who were faced with overwhelming stress, losing someone dear to them, or lack of self-worth. the only solution people thought about was suicide and i won't lie and say i didn't think of doing the same when i was faced with these situations/emotions. but let me tell you guys some encouraging words from someone who got through it all and i hope it'll shine even a sliver of light on someone who really needs it. my father passed away from colon cancer when i was 9 years old, my little twin brother only be 5 at the time, and it was devastating. my mom spoke out of emotion and told me i had to grow up and take charge and at such an emotional time, those words made me act "tough" in front of others. in other words, i never really dealt with the emotions i felt when my dad passed away. i brought the feeling of grief with me as i grew up and as the years went on it got heavier and heavier. it was just a matter of time before it all spilled out. in middle school, my grief manifested itself into rebellious behavior. a straight-a student turned into a bc student. my mom got mad and being asian (lol) she would of course discipline the shit out of me which added anger into my emotional cauldron. i also ended up getting bullied in school for things i couldn't control such as my height and the way my own face looked. so adding a little sprinkle of lack of self-confidence and you basically had a ticking time bomb for an explosion of emotions. one night, my mom just flipped her shit when she saw a c on my report card and and full on ballistic mode on my ass and that lit the fuse. that night i wanted to kill myself. i already lost my dad who was my best friend, i've been bullied to the point i would just want to hide in bathroom stalls, i didn't find a purpose in life, what else did i have to lose? after my mom dealt with me i sat in my room and began contemplating on what i would do to end it all. but then, for some reason out of all the dark thoughts that was going through in my head, i remembered my aspirations to become a doctor. see, when my father died of colon cancer, i wanted to help other people who were going through the same thing as my dad because no one should ever have to face the kind of pain that he went through as well as what our family went through. although it sounds cheesy and super cliche, having that goal really helped me at the time and pushed me to start performing at the level i should be at, not only for myself, but for my dad and even my mom and little brothers. so that goal carried me through high school and i'm now in college where i was faced with an incredible amount of stress. being a biochemistry major with a minor in computer science is no joke. the amount of work you have on top of the expectation put on you for being in such a competitive major was draining and there was a point during my winter quarter of my first year where i wanted to end it all again. i also had some shitty roommates at the time so they weren't any help either. i thought of jumping off the tall buildings on campus, overdosing on easily accessible drugs, blacking out, and the list goes on. however, this time around, i made a strong group of friends and i had a loving boyfriend who understood the past issues i had with my mental health. they served as my support group and got me out of my slump and they didn't stop even when i told them i didn't want to listen to them. they showed me my worth and the value of having people who truly care about you surround you not only when things are fun and happy but during your darkest times as well. long story short: things really do get better. things do eventually work out. you just have to be open to the idea that it will. of course it won't be easy and the story i told you guys didn't include a lot of other events and factors that added to my emotional trauma, but take everything one step at a time and always know help is available. whether it's professional help or just the company of people who love and care about you, there's always going onto be help. heck, it might even be a pet. feel free to message me to ask for advice, ask for other events in my life that might help you too, or just to have someone to talk to! i hope i shine even just a little light or a sliver of hope on you guys. 💕	1

is my [20f] crush [20m] interested, or is he playing games? i'm not sure if i can figure this guy out. so i had worked up the courage to finally instagram message this guy - something i never do - who i would see around campus all the time over this past school year. i had a crush from afar because he, to me, is unconventionally attractive, has great style, appeared to be reserved and somewhat shy, is the same major as me, and is into artwork and good music. i would also catch him staring at me sometimes but i'm not sure if i was blowing those instances out of proportion. his response was great, he had asked me to hangout to get some food or coffee twice as i couldn't the first 2 times he asked due to my anxiety. i won't get into that, but basically my nerves were crippling and got the best of me. i had never been this nervous around a guy before (i was in a two year relationship prior to this). so, after telling him i couldn't go both of those times for whatever stupid reason (fully knowing i sounded like an idiot), he told me not to worry about it and he proceeded to give me his phone number in case i ever wanted to hangout, as it was easier than instagram message. also, his best friend followed me on instagram after i messaged him which i took to be a good thing. i was still embarrassed from being flaky and also my nerves were absolutely through the roof, so i had waited a week to contact him again. i really thought i had blown it, especially given this time lapse. i had told him that i'd really like to hangout if he was still interested. he told me that he was pretty busy that week but he was still down to do something sometime (finals were about 2 weeks away). this is where i reaaaally thought i blew it. but! next weekend at this "spring fest" thing my university was having, my friends and i were sitting eating food and his table was next to ours which i was nervous about so i didn't make eye contact. to my surprise i looked up and he has pulled up a chair next to me and started talking to me. he was incredibly polite, sweet, laid back, and interesting. it was really easy going although i was so nervous. after that ended, fast forward a few days and i saw him during the week. i saw him outside of the library he asked me if i wanted to grab coffee that upcoming weekend. i told him definitely. so, a few days later he texted me and the next day we got coffee. i had finally gotten over my nerves and forced myself to go. i was so proud of myself. aside from a few pauses in conversation which didn't bother me too much, everything was great. we talked about nice things, he paid for me and made sure to hold the doors, he was respectful, etc. he didn't try anything too flirty or sexual except for a hug. he told me that i have a really cool sense of style and a great eye for photography. as we got back to campus, he told me that he had fun and that we should do it again and for me to text him if i wanted to hangout again. he added me on snapchat later that evening. i couldn't tell if his lack of flirting was because of his shyness or what. he said that in high school he barely said a word and he still didn't strike me as someone who was super outgoing because every time i saw him, even with friends, he had a relatively laid back demeanor. also, may i note, i had never seen him on his phone in person. *here's where the issue begins* during the week, i noticed he had snapchatted me a few times but was always quick to leave me open. i just thought "oh, maybe he's busy with work and since he doesn't seem like much of a phone person, he it's probably normal for him." i had asked him to hangout again, and he responded "for sure 🤙🤙🤙". in my gut, i had this feeling it wouldn't happen because it was 2 or 3 days before he had to go back home (he's 2 hours away from me). come the next day, i am about to go up the elevator in the library and out of nowhere i hear someone whisper yell my name. i stopped the doors from closing and i looked out and he was him. he kind of jogged over to me and he said "i just wanted to let you know that i don't know if i'll be able to see you" he proceeded to tell me that he just wanted to say goodbye and hoped i had a good summer, and to "keep in touch, okay?" he hugged me again. i have been on summer break for about 3 weeks now, and he maintains contact pretty regularly. he snapchats me every other day, sometimes a few in a row. i took this as him showing an interest, because why would he even care to send me snapchats if he didn't want to talk. but here's where i get really confused. he does not carry on long conversations. sometimes he leaves me open extremely quickly, other times he'll snapchat for a little bit then randomly end it. i'm not sure how many of you use snapchat, but his score is around 27,000 which is not high at all. mine is about 457,000. lol. it bothers me so much though, because i feel like an idiot. i feel like i look naive. why would he just leave me open so quickly? my questions go as follows. 1. is he a player and i don't even realize it? i truly did not even get the slightest indication that he could be that way while in person. he did not have the confidence of a player nor did he try to do anything a guy like that would. he doesn't strike me as someone who's pulling a lot. hahaha 2. is he interested but not interested enough? the contact is pretty regular, so why? 3. why does he leave me open but snapchat other people? is he just bad at keeping up conversation over the phone? he had asked me where i went hiking a couple of days ago because i posted something on instagram, and he said the view was awesome and followed it by saying something like " you'll have to be my hiking guide when i get back :)" i want to talk with him and i want to know what's even going through his head. i don't want to be made a fool out of. our hangout was so nice and he seems like he's got a great head on his shoulders, good morals, and cool interests. i'll be upset if he proves to be otherwise. tl;dr: my crush and i hungout a little bit before school ended, and it was awesome. he seems like a great guy with a lot of potential and interesting qualities. however, although he maintains contact with me now that school ended, he doesn't keep the conversation up for awhile. i don't know if i should be suspicious of him or not because he doesn't strike me as that kind of guy based on his body language, etc.	0

i fractured my kneecap while jerking off for future reference i wank on the toilet, easy to rid of the evidence. so here i am, doing 15 year old things (choking the chicken yknow) and here i am standing in front of my toilet wanking, about to burst and so i squat down to be able to blow the load to the toilet right? well wrong. my right leg buckles, makes all sorts of nasty sounds and i immediately do not want to nut anymore. so i shove my dick in my pants and lay on the floor clutching my knee. stand back up and wobble over to my bed. my parents rush in and ask what happened. and all i could think of at the time is that i fell while taking a piss. so we wait a day to see if pain will stop. it doesn't. we go to the doctor and get an xray. next thing yknow is that i have a bone doctor appointment in a few days and i'm on crutches. nice 👌	0

my (21m) and her (21f) slow-to-build relationship i just want to ask for others experiences/advice for dealing with slow beginning relationships. specifically, long distance relationship. a close person in my life and i found to share affection for each other, and a couple days agreed to move forward. she's had violently traumatic relationships in the past, and she's explained she's slow to open when it comes to love. this contrasts my immature romantic side that kind of wants to kiss and avoid responsibility all day. i know romance can also be mature, but you get my point. the fact that it's long distance puts an extra strain on us. does anyone have any wisdom as to how to move forward best? thanks ❤️ tl;dr - what's the wisest way to work on a slow-to-build relationship while keeping some romance?	0
you deserve to live your life idk who needs to see this right now, but it gets better. i know how that sounds, and that you've heard that a million times before, but you are just as entitled to a full and happy life as anyone else. especially the younger people on here, i just turned 19 and i've struggled with stuff my whole life,, the worst it's ever been was back around december and into january. but life doesn't even begin until after high school. wether you know it or not, people will care that you're gone and it will destroy a lot of people so if anything stay strong for them. then soon enough you'll be free to find out who you truly are because it gets better. if you're caught in a nihilist existential crisis and realize that nothing really means anything, then look at it like this: if nothing actually means anything, then in turn the only thing that matters is your life. make the most of it, happiness is harder than it sounds but you got this because you're stronger than that. love y'all if u need anything lmk ❤️	1

never will i bend never will you break me🎵 so i've known her for 2 years now from school and we've hung out a couple times, got drunk together, stayed up late with friends etc. and she's really cool in person and i asked her out last year, got rejected big time but i'm fine with my position as friend (she was very keen on staying friends and not block all contact) and so because of covid and school started we haven't had time to talk to each other irl and so i've asked her if she wanted to hang out or take a walk (easiest things to plan and get out of) because we live [walking distance] apart. but every time i try to suggest and plan these things she ghosts me. then when i text her that i'm fine of being denied or rejected but please tell me the truth she always answers with something like "mb i didn't see your message" or "i'm sorry next time". then i suggest dumb shit activities again and th cycle repeats making me feel needy when i know i'm not, just trying to hang out with a friend i haven't seen in a while and catch up. i've texted her about how we both don't like texting each other and i'm sick of planning these stupid activities she won't answer to but she seemed really sincere in her apology explaining how she doesn't know what's been going on, she's confused bla-bla-bla. i know how she is irl and believe that all her intentions are 90% pure. the rejection makes me feel like shit but that sadness keeps me making myself better, more in shape, less confident, more in shape etc. what should i do? should i block all contact? should i just go to her house and demand to talk to her? idk guys... feeling stressed	0
kissing my child's owie and getting poop in my mouth this actually happened today, just a few hours ago. apologies in advance for typos or formatting, i'm on mobile. first, some short back story. i have a 1 1/2 year old daughter, and (like many parents) my wife and i will kiss her owies when she gets hurt. for some reason, this greatly helps with the healing process. she really latched on to this idea a few months ago and loves it so much that she will pretend she got hurt on her hand so we'll kiss her. it's adorable. she'll come up to me holding out her hand or wrist saying "ow, ow, ow!" so it's become a habit to automatically kiss her hand when she holds it out to me. i'm sure you can see where this is going. this morning started like many others, with me waking up to my daughter calling me from her room for me to get her out of her crib. to set the stage, it was still a bit dark and i didn't have my glasses on, so i wasn't seeing clearly. i had just woken up, so i wasn't thinking clearly. i walked into her room and she was sitting in her crib silently holding out her fingers with a sad look on her face.. (cue dramatic music.) i instinctively reached out and grabbed her hand and placed a gentle kiss on her fingers. i felt something wet on my lips, and i looked closer at her fingers, and to my horror, she had soft brown poop on them. and so now, so did i in my mouth. in retrospect i'm impressed that i didn't scream. i calmly picked her up, cleaned off my lips with a wipe, cleaned off her fingers with a wipe, put hand sanitizer on her hands, my hands, and my lips. i changed her diaper, and put more hand sanitizer on my lips and hands when i was done. yuck. thankfully it only got on the outside of my mouth, but i'm still horrified. my wife is getting home from a weekend trip and is arriving in a few minutes. nobody tell her there was poop on my lips or she won't kiss me anymore 😂 tl;dr: my daughter was holding out her fingers as if she wanted me to kiss an owie. i did it, and got poop on my lips.	0

i'm stupid and all my problems end up going back to looking ugly before this begins, i'd like to say sorry for anyone reading this because it's messy and is just a big rant, whenever the paragraph seems like it's meant to be sent to someone, its aimed at my current best friend to clear that up i came to the realisation that even after i spend an ungodly amount of money fixing myself, i'll still never be happy with myself because i'm that cunt and that ugle, and i got proof of it 😎 which just makes me more sad because i will waste money on it, and i regardless of what people say i will end up being alone until i die because i'm a prick (oh boy a teenage boy being sad about not having a girlfriend what's new :// ) which makes me more sad because i know i'm being basic and it isn't a big reason to be sad 🤷‍♂️ oh and like almost suicide over it like a couple days ago is funne like who would've thought i would be that bitch because i thought i was asexual or gay?but no, almost killing myself bc of feelings for someone else, shaken 🤠. i've hid all my problems forever and now it's just extra sad because i finally want to tell them to someone but i refuse to put any of this on you because i'll feel terrible, idk how to say it without being cringe, but you just talking to me makes me happy like all the time because no ones ever been interested in saying anything to me unless they were sad and wanted my btec counselling :/ i hate everything bout myself, every last fucking thing, and i will continue to ruin every chance of happiness i get because i'm stupid, i wonder how long itll be before i ruin our friendship? my bet is when we get drunk because i will say all my secrets that are bad 😃 i've had to get rid of like 3 paragraphs because it was all just me ranting about being ugly like what is my problem why am i so upset by it, this is just making me hate myself more because i say it so much. i'm probably pissing everyone off because i sure as fuck am pissing myself off with it but like i have so many issues with my self image that i will always be alone 🕺 like i cried because i didn't want *a girl who had mutual feelings for me* to be bullied if she got with me, so i just cucked myself, i feel bad when i'm walking around with you because it probably gets you flamed for being friends with me who else has to photoshop their photos for ig? like no! i do it and im still fucking ugly which is just hilarious and sad i can't wait to not live to 25 because i will end up killing myself over something insignificant- love that for me 🥵i won't get a job because i can't do basic shut and will be dropping out of college, won't be able to get with anyone to make me happy, anyone i have feelings for just makes me feel 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 and i make them feel 💀💀💀 imagine only having one person who ever wants to get with you and that's because they want to lose their virginity to another virgin, and i'm the only fucking one 🕺🕺🕺 but in the end we all know i'm not really bothered about not having anyone and just need an excuse to say i'm ugly because apparently that's the only ducking thing i can say about myself	1

usually i'm sad, now i'm just angry. i've spent years contemplating this night, how i'd do it, when and where. never thought i'd end up like this though. i've finally pushed everyone away, made every last person in my life hate me and toss me aside. i've had a general dislike of people for years but now that i've been isolated a while i simply can't stand them. to hear opinions and stories and have to feign interest in everything they say. it's exhausting. couple that with the fact my life is going nowhere and my lack of interest in doing anything, it's slowly made life intolerable. my only savior my entire life has been drugs. one plant has provided me more entertainment and pleasure than all of humanity combined. unfortunately my supply has come to an end and as i don't wish to live another moment of sober agony, i'll finish myself off when i finish my stash off. if you know me, fuck you. and for those that'll act heartbroken just knock the shit off and throw me in a hole. you didn't care enough when i was alive so don't start now. i'm glad i got the chance to burn out rather than fade away. it really is better this way.✌🏻	1

i've been compiling and planning a d&d like campaign set in westeros but instead of using weapons, you use pokemon i'm fully aware of the niche nature of this pursuit and that i don't have any friends who would enjoy playing it, but painstakingly mapping out what areas of westeros would be inhabited by which wild pokemon is incredibly fun to me. so far i've completely populated beyond the wall since it has the fewest specific locations and it felt pretty obvious what kind of pokemon should go there. i'm about to make breakfast, then i'll start populating the north with poke-manz over coffee. i don't think i care if i never get to gm this. i'm having fun. 🙂	0
i gave up on life 5 years ago because i'm uglyi'm male, aged 30 (look younger) 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) skinny af lanky with long legs etc, pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin (never touched a girl or even had more than a few words spoken to me by one) so yea in the looks department it's over. i never leave the house and havnt since 2015. between 2012-2015 i had a bar job,i had girls like me and i wasn't ugly then facially i had a pleasant baby face, with clear skin nice hair and i never was insecure a lot. i got older and ugly. i met some amazing people but also some horrors. horrible women who'd call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers i worked with. the good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times by a fat ugly overweight bitch. i know that sounds mean but it isn't if you knew how she treated me to the good looking dudes. it was horrific in the end i got fed up and left and havnt left the house since to let ageing hit me like a train. ◾(before i had that job i had a job advisor for 6 months and she was the same, i was very quiet but also really polite and respectful never complained a word tried really hard to get a job with a good attitude and it got me nowhere, she was still snotty and bitchy with me and would totally ignore me if i asked her advice when i needed it. but yet you'd see other guys who could be aggressive and disrespectful but because they were hunky/manly and attractive she'd open up easily to them and be very nice with them and help them no problem. (she treated me differently because i'm ugly. i never got over it ) this gave me trust issues) i had a crush on her too so that our cherry on top of cake with that) i do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and that's the same, women staring me down because i'm skinny like it's my fault they're fat. other guys i work with staring at me with a 'wtf is that' face and overweight short girls calling me a 'ming' (whatever that means) it's great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and i think 'it's nice when someone looks past what i look like'. it's funny how i succumbed to judging people's niceness to how they judge me on my looks or not. but there isn't many like that about. i eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner i feel better. still hidoeus nevertheless. a comment on here once i asked about my hair one comment said 'he's clearly balding and hidoeus btw' and it got upvoted 17 times. i drink whiskey every night watching cartoons and i'm starting to get chest pains. also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 at work and she was gorgeous too. you should of seen her instagram at the time it was fire. she worked in the bar with me. i was 24 then. i looked nice then. you should see me now it's depressing. waking up every morning crying through sleepy half shut eyes i basically live upstairs watching netflix everyday and smoking weed in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or younger/older have looks on their side and a life to go with it. funny how most of them are cocky as hell and very arrogant and the girls love it. i have a friend whos like that he's cocky as hell and thinks every girls he walks past fancies him and you wouldn't believe how the girls love that persona on him too. it's not about getting girls for me, but i could care less about not getting sex tbh etc (even tho girls where i live are horrible and snotty unless youre a chad) it's juts the restricted life i have because i'm ugly and seeing good looking dudes treated better even when they're complete cocky arrogant assoles. lookism man now i have a really bad incurable skin condition and my face looks worse than ever just wants the nightmare to be over ***i enjoy being asleep so much that i wanna die***	1
help! dealing with insecurities triggered by new relationship 😭 hi all! i [33f] just started dating an amazing guy [35m] and i thought i'd dealt with all my relationship insecurities, but noooo. i'm getting badly triggered by certain things in this new relationship, for example - this guy has several very attractive female friends, some in our city, some other cities. they all seem super lovely, intelligent, ambitious women and think the following any time i see them post on his social feeds (he's also quite friendly back to them): - does he have feelings for them? - did he ever have feelings for them? - is he with me because i'm second choice and none of them wanted to date him? - why would he want to be with me when he's got all these hot, smart, awesome friends? - is he going to leave me for one of them because i just don't tick as many boxes? so, to give you a bit of context, i've never (to my knowledge) been cheated on, grew up an only child and went to an all girls school so never got used to having guys around unless i was attracted to them or them attracted to me. i've had those feelings above with past boyfriends, so i know it's possible. he says past partners have had issues with him having attractive female friends, and he says he's always just been friends with them, and he's a very kind, sweet, thoughtful guy and i have no reason to think he'd ever cheat, but yeah... help me. how do i shut my damn brain up ;) tl;dr - new boyfriend triggering insecurities (mostly around his female friends) i thought i'd dealt with, but clearly not 🤣 thanks!	0

men are incapable of love?? as a bisexual woman, i've been (unfortunately) exposed to radical feminists/misandrists online where they have said that men are "physically, emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically incapable" of truly loving a woman not only because of your "privilege" but because of your moral shortcomings--according to them. other reasons of theirs have been because of men's "lack of empathy," "self-gratifying sexual needs," violent natures, shallowness towards appearance, needing to have women "heal" them, and lack of loyalty because of wanting to "stick it wherever they want." \[paraphrased.\] unfortunately, hearing these things can have a negative impact on a woman attracted to men such as myself. i've been hesitant to imagine a future with a man because of these things. why be with someone who is incapable of love if only women are capable of it? 🙄 so, what are your thoughts about these stereotypes? no need to hold back, i need a dose of reality for a change.	0

i got a boyfriend 🥰 ok so for a while i have been talking to a boy that i caught feelings for hard, and for the last month i have been working up the courage to ask him out and i finally didn't and he said yes	0
does he (m30) love himself more than he loves me(f29)? tl;dr my boyfriend says he loves me so so much but doesnt treat me like he should if he really loves me i think. about us: 2008- met in high school. hooked up for 6 months before i moved to another city. 2011- slept with eachother again. summer vacation from college. 2017- february. started conversations on facebook. april 2017- slept with eachother again. but this time he had gotten himself a girlfriend (f29). he said she doesnt treat him well, and that they argue often. anyway, i was a bitch and slept with. they broke up december 2017. in 2018 we ended up like fwb. he found another girl in april i think. so he had two fwbs. i said go for it, get over your ex-girlfriend, you need this. he dumped her in june 2018. he didnt have other girls than us two and always said he wants to be poly. but from july 1018 i think we have seen eachother every day. i asked him "what happened with the poly-thing? he said he was unhappy earlier, and that now he only wants me. in september, we traveled to spain for 1 week and moved in with eachother a week later. he wanted me to meet his family. now, he says he loves me every day. and "marry me"- when he is super happy. he has introduced me to all his friends. he hugs me snd touch me. and he talks to me about our future. also: on his phone when he doesnt do the things above. always on his phone working or playing chess or chatting with his friends (from all over this kontinent" but!! why does he treat me like this: his ego. he wants to make himself happy more than he wants me to be happy. he never listen to me when i want to choose movies or tv-series. doesnt want to listen when i talk about how my day at work was because i work with so heavy and depressing stuff (refugees). if he could choose between eating risotto with sticks or fork, he would chose sticks because of the minimal effort. this is something he swears by, minimal effort, and he is "proud of it". i told him this and he knows it. and also, he has a weird humour. like, he manipulates or ignore or tease. his friends laugh when hes "funny" but i've said his humour sometimes hurt me. why does he act like this and also says he loves me so so much?! thanks ❤️	0

young and conflicting so i'm 19 about to turn 20 this month, my boyfriend is 22 turning 23 in september. we live together, and have been together for one year and 4 months (sounds crazy when i type it out). i absolutely love him, and he is the closest i've ever been to anybody before. here is some important background! i have clinical depression and anxiety, and have kept my distance from most people. i don't even talk with my best friends much, maybe once every two weeks! i've always been thinking about if he is someone i really want to marry or spend the rest of my life with. and i do want him! but i think we want different things, and i don't know if we would be happy with each other in the long run. i kind of want to break up because i question our relationship, and think that it is not fair to him and i need to let him find someone who wont. i feel terrible knowing that we cuddle every night and i think these thoughts. i cant tell if its me being self destructive and selfish, or if i'm being rational but paranoid. we already told each other that we would be together forever and we say i love you multiple times throughout the day. i feel its wrong to promise that and regret it but at the time i truly felt it. i don't want to hurt him because i want the best for him. i'm scared that if i break up i'll regret it and not be-able to get him back and become suicidal. i need advice should i end it or am i thinking regular things that someone would in a longer term relationship?help 🥺 tl;dr love partner but want to breakup due to different values, and effort. is it right to end a relationship based on different views? and to break promises about our future together?	0
getting lost. actually happened today, i'm on a phone so prepare for a tough read. my peer group and i are on a field trip to belgium to see war memorials. as with school trips, we need the cheapest ferry ride so we have to leave at 1 am so by about 9 pm i'm completely knackered. we go to a memorial and my grandma (bless her heart) has sent me a list of ancestors at the memorial. que the fuck up. i'm going to find this family member and when i do i'm chuffed to bits. i send a photo to my grandma and when i return to our ren-dez-vu i realise that no one is there. at this point i'm shitting myself as i'm in a foreign country and i don't know the way back to the hotel. i search it on my phone and away we go. now it turns out that they were on the other side of the memorial. they sent 3 teachers out looking for me and send one with the rest of the group to escort them back to the accommodation. they also called my parents to let them know i was missing. then, i got picked up by my friends on their way back to the hotel. everyone was worried shitless and i'm just sat there being my socially awkward self. tldr: lost school group and got lost in a foreign country after looking at a war memorial. parents informed and 45 mins spent looking for me. parents informed i was missing in action. picked up by friends on the way back to the hotel. back in the hotel room now and all is good 😀	0
my brother just made a joke that makes it very clear he's heard me having sex me and my boyfriend have sex at my house usually. my brother had a bad habit of coming home earlier than expected and not giving me a heads up. we were playing 1v1s in destiny 2 and when i killed him he jokingly/mockingly called me a naughty girl and said he'd call my boyfriend to come over and spank me (it's not creepy, we make jokes a ton). but that means he's heard me call myself that and say that i need to be spanked😀 i want to die	0

had some good karma go my way today. i was feeling a bit down today, as are most people. i've always been a good worker (i hope) and i always try to be nice and have fun with coworkers to ease the tension and dread of working a minimum wage job. one of my co-workers (let's call her r) boyfriend's came in, he was ringing up stuff with that co-worker and i had just started my shift so i grabbed a sprite and pulled out my card. he stopped and noticed who i was and said "r always tells me how nice you are and how fun you make it here, grab another sprite they're a 2/3.50 sale, i'll buy it." being minnesotan i insisted not to do that, but i let him pay for it since he really wanted to show appreciation, since another co-worker had done rude things to her in the past (won't say because i promised not to), i had been a saving grace and really lit up work for her, and hadn't been weird at all. then about 30 mins to closing, store is dead and one of the regular coupon ladies comes in as usual, me and r are the only ones in the store, so she decides to hand out little valentine gift packets, containing 3 little fruit candies and some mnm's. that's the only valentine i got that day so it really cheered me up. not to mention, a class that i had gotten screwed over on and worked my ass off on, i got the news that i got an a in it, meaning that for my first semester i got a near perfect straight a honor roll, i also got ahead on my schoolwork (online school.) just this morning i wasn't in the very best of moods, but everything is turning around and many other things are going in my favor for the first time this year, i'm just so happy and wanted to share, sorry if my stories are too boring or short, i've never really been a good storyteller 😝	0
can i get the hoodie and the girl back? i (m25) managed to re-kindle a flame with a coworker (f23) from 5 summers ago (so we were 20 and 18). we had only been exchanging snapchats/liking & dm'ing brief conversations off our insta posts to keep up over the years. still always thought she was the cutest and we definitely have great chemistry. we went to different schools, she's 2 years younger than me, and we normally weren't in our hometown at the same time. regardless, finally got to see her face to face and went skiing with her recently (bought her lift ticket and drove us). we talked the entire time, and didn't even need to have music on for the drive. the conversations were so engaging and getting to catch up with her after all these years was great. so we started texting consistently and going on occasional dates for a couple weeks this winter. mostly ending in us watching netflix on my bed and some cuddling and kissing. first weekend rolls around where we're free from work and want to hangout. we go to a fun bar, get drunk, and she was eager to get an uber back to my place... removing layers up the stairs, i picked her up and laid her down on my bed and kept making out. things were getting heated. she could tell i was hard from dry humping so she asks if i have a condom. i just kinda drunkenly reached for them in my bedside drawer. tried putting one on but lost all the momentum, plus whiskey dick was settling in. she's talking dirty to me and i'm trying to salvage this from going downhill. she wouldn't change positions, wouldn't use her hands, and just starfished on my bed. so it went downhill and we didn't fuck. i thought it was awkward and took blame. she insists it's fine but decides to leave. i gave her one of my hoodies and she left in an uber. i'm pretty defeated. we're still texting a little over the next two days but she always has an excuse for why she can't hangout. (errands, too busy from work, she's a nurse and can be away for hours, but normally she could always text/snap me at work) finally i just asked what's going on? haven't heard from you much this weekend (which i thought was weird considering she wanted to fuck me on friday night) and hope it wasn't because of the shitty circumstances surrounding how that night ended. she apologizes and says she's been busy packing for a vacation that week, tired from work. i said i kinda need the hoodie back for my vacation coming up soon and she agreed to get it back to me. then out of the blue that evening she says sorry for ignoring my hangout requests but she just started dating someone. sorry she made it seem like she was available, that wasn't fair, and it wasn't something i did wrong. ok cool, thanks for being honest with me, but i'd like that hoodie back please haha hahaha ok i'll return it👍🏻 a few weeks pass with no communication. i didn't get back to her about the hoodie before my vacation. she texts me a week after my vacation and says sorry i didn't have the hoodie for my trip, when can i get it back to you? i haven't responded and it's been a week. frankly, i don't give a fuck about that hoodie. i'm kinda pissed she was either lying to me about a boyfriend to avoid me, using me for dates, or was playing both of us simultaneously and i got the short end of the stick. i still like her and want (no, need) redemption. i've been in a dry spell since that night. not sure how to go about it though. do you think she actually wants to meet back up or was she just doing some spring cleaning and is kind enough to ask if i want it back before trashing it? tldr: an old flame and i started talking with again had one night of poor sexual performance from me and now has my hoodie. i want redemption, but she started dating a guy less than 2 days after that night....	0
found his spank bank? i need to know what to do or how to feel about him storing highly explicit photos and videos on his camera roll (of all places🙄🙄) from porn sites. this is the second time i've addressed the issue with him and the thing is that i don't fit the description of the girls he has saved. at.all. and it honestly has me feeling insecure and troubled. our relationship is semi long distance, we see each other two times a week sometimes even once a week. so i get that the lonely feelings are there and he needs to relieve it, i don't mind him watching it or whatever but what is the point of saving them..in his camera roll no less. and he felt attacked that i even found them, not sorry but attacked, his privacy was invaded as he said.. the first time he said he'll get rid of them, i left it alone, and that was back in the earlier months of 2018 and then i found them again about a 3 weeks ago and he said he got rid of them last week but this week i found that he still had some. what the heck am i supposed to do here?? tl;dr: how would you feel if you found out that your significant other had explicit pics/videos from adult sites on their phone in their camera roll? (especially if the guy/girl in them doesn't even look anything like you or share the same background)	0
that nas quote is rlly sticking rn yk the one: "life's a bitch and then you die" emotions are lame i wanna stop feeling things. might start trying that today actually maybe i can force myself to stop having emotions 🤔	0
i think depression is creeping back into my life and i don't have anyone to talk about it with.. and i'm low-key scared this time. i've been emotionally numb since i was 14 (21 now) so this feeling isn't exactly uncommon, but recently i'm getting more bad days than good days and it's worrying me more and more.. it started when my first love (was also a very close friend) was beaten viciously by her (at the time boyfriend) [thats a whole story in of its self and i'm not going into it but man did it leave me dark.] -- after the aftermath & fallout from that i found possibly my best friend that i've ever had. this girl kept me rooted, helped me climb out of some of the darkest holes i found myself in and was also a major factor in me not.. doing anything 'stupid' when my father would beat on me. after some time, our friendship fizzled into some weird spots and eventually.. she left too. these 2 people probably had some of the biggest impacts on me. they were the only 2 that i'd told some of my inner most thoughts to, and them me; but when it came to the end, they left. i'm not the most trusting person due to some childhood stuff and that was the cherry on the cake for me and now i refuse to show my true emotions. a lot of fake smiles, fake laughs, and generally putting up a wall that lets people feel like they know a lot whilst also knowing bare nothing of essence. some of my friends know of my past but all think i've gotten over it (my own words to them - yes i lied, yes it might be bad, but i'm not really prepared to let anyone in like that again. i'm done with people walking out on me and it killing me) after she left i kinda became a recluse. started smoking weed at 17; still managed to finish college with top marks but refused to socialise with anyone outside of my friend group. i have happy days and not so happy days, just like everyone. but most of the time i don't 'feel' anything... empty mostly. don't get me wrong, there's times where i'm genuinely happy (usually with the help of drugs ngl) but most days.. it's not that i'm sad, it's that i'm feeling legitimately.. void. i guess i learnt to live with it to an extent. because i don't want people in i learnt to put up a good facade. all my friends know me as the happy go lucky one, the one who always looks to the bright side ("ah well, look at the silver lining" is a phrase i use a lot) mostly because i'm so used to seeking out the worst result in order to better prepare myself for it when it eventually comes around.. so it's a method i've taught myself to help sidetrack those thoughts and occupy myself with more pleasing imagery. in the last few years i suppose i became 'comfortably numb', i mean i wasn't happy but i wasn't as bad as previous years so.. silver linings? but about 2/3 months ago now, i met a girl. and i knew from the get go i should've distanced myself; there was just something screaming at me in my gut saying this is gonna end in tears again.. and yet, for the first 2 months i could feel myself becoming happier. i wouldn't wake up with wet eyes, or in bad moods, i'd wake up actually happy and looking forward to being with this girl. within a week of seeing each other it was obvious we shared a wave length, it felt like i'd known her for years despite it still being early days. well about 2/3 weeks ago now, she decides she wants to break things off for her own reasons but wants to stay friends... idk, those 2-3 months with her was the first time i can actually say i wasn't emotionally numb anymore. i would feel anger, sadness & happiness in ways i hadn't in years. the feelings would be overwhelming and whilst a lot to handle revitalised me because.. well shit i hadn't felt some of these things in genuine years. i guess she opened up a portion to my world i thought i'd lost and now she doesn't want to be there anymore so i guess.. c'est la vie? more than anything.. she made me aware of just how numb i had become and now that she's gone from my life in that respect.. i don't want to go back to being empty me but i'm falling back into old habits so easily and.. well.. i just needed to get this out into the open world instead of ruminating it over, and over, and over, and over, and fucking over in my head. idk man fuck it, thanks if you read this far if not.. well congrats, you can be #4 on my list of not to bother 🤙🏼 "fake it till you make it"	0
funny thing i noticed.. while slowly giving away my possessions in preparation for death, i have made a lot of people happy. for some, it was the nicest they have ever been to me. 🤷♀️	1
so it's my birthday today and i'm kinda sad about it lol. yep, today is my birthday and mostly everyone forgot about it lol. to make matters worse i got some gender neutral cards from my parents... i'm trans mtf and they couldn't bring themselves to give me some daughter ones... kinda sucks and i refuse to open them. didn't get me that teddy bear i asked for either lol. i dunno, i'm just kinda sulking and giving them the silent treatment right now 😂 anyone have any nice birthdays lately? might cheer me up a bit to know other peoples families aren't as clueless a mine :)	0
i want to kill myself cause i'm ugly and asiani'm half asian but i look noticeably asian and i'm scared of getting killed on the streets cause of corona. my asian parent isn't even chinese but people will think i'm from there. once this gets bad, my life will be in danger and i could die a painful death from a mob even tho i'm innocent. i'm also a 2/10 and no girl has ever been interested in me and my life is over cause i'll never have love 😢😢😢 i've already planned to end it but i'm pussying out and keep delaying. hopefully racism from corona will help push me over the edge.	1

someone out there is thinking of you right now❤️ anyone going through any tough times. just understand you have a greater purpose. sometimes it takes a week to find, sometimes it takes years. but stick with it and live it up. adventure, enjoy nature, enjoy people and if you are alone simply people watch. humans are so interesting. but you will make friends. you get the energy you put into the world.	1
thinking about my life you know, they always say that if you wait, or act and take care of you own fate, life is gonna change and get better. for my case it's a lie. i know too well how i have not an happy ending, but a bad one. and few will care or understand as the times goes by. that happens if life has been easy on you, pain is temporary. if, like me, always had to deal with loneliness and betrayal, and to act as an adult before the proper age came, to forget of being a kid for the sake of others, you won't have any tools to process pain or cope with it properly, cause you only got spitted in the face for years by life. thanks god this likely is my last year in this pit. my resolution and peace with the decision has never been so strong. already found the day, and few will mourn me or remember me as many more died that sad day. i finally understand peace for what really is. time to vanish upon thin air thanks for reading this, it means a lot to me 😌	1
anyone feel uncomfortable around girls because they don't want them to feel uncomfortable?? so i'm 15 years old and i study on a school that used to be an all girls school but now isn't. before quarantine, i always had to be careful on how i move because if i accidentally touch a girl i'll have to start a long conversation with them or just look like a plain old creep. like damn bro, do you know how it easy it is for a guy's reputation to get destroyed because some girl called him a creep? 😔😔	0
high expectations hi i'm 14 and i come from a common hardworking asian family in the u.s. recently i have been criticized by my dad to the point where i broke down and almost attempted something that i really don't want to talk about. what stopped me is the past when my parents had time to care about me, my new friends, and my aunt and uncle that have given me the best childhood i had ever wanted. throughout my childhood slowly most of my close friends have moved away or stopped talking to me, because they have changed. i'm only fourteen and i attend high school, so homework along with these problems really got to me as a person. my parents don't understand me and only look at me as a hopeless child at the times of depression. no support, no love, just high expectations 😖 mind my use of writing	1
i just realised i wrote "uniparental sodomy" when i meant to write "uniparental disomy" on my exam i am horrified 😰 at least i hope whoever is checking my exam gets a laugh out of it.	0

attempting to help a naked prostitute on acid... made the 911 call just before 2am est so this has actually just happened. was just woken up by my dog alerting to something, before i could even open my eyes i hear screaming coming from upstairs. our upstairs neighbour is male, single (girlfriend moved out recently, so i'm assuming) and usually quiet as hell. so i hear a female voice, repeatably screaming help me, he's trying to kill me, help me...followed by a lot of banging and crashing. i wake my boyfriend up, and immediately he's flys out of bed and starts getting dressed (it was that loud and intense he knew instantly). i call 911 as he's heading out the door and upstairs (should be noted that we don't share access to our apartment and both have front doors that lead directly outside). so i go through the conversation with the operator and go outside to make sure i see if anyone leaves. at this point i realize they are all outside (boyfriend, upstairs neighbour and female) she's still screaming so i shout for her to come towards me and away from the guys. next minute i see her coming down the stairs and she's ass fucking naked (at no point has she stopped screaming) i grab her and head for my apartment (as it's 25f degrees out) when my boyfriend screams out "she's on drugs don't take her inside", i yell back "well bring her some clothes or something then!!!". this is when things start to go downhill...and she starts screaming that i am going to kill her and i quote "chop her up into tiny pieces because i'm a prostitute". i'm attempting to reassure her when her phone is produced and upstairs neighbour says "i think it's her mom". i grab the phone and the lady tells me she's her mum and that she's having a bad trip and to put her in the shower...and then wham! she cracks me right in the face! i drop the phone and grab her arms so she can't do it again. the mother, who is screaming "id beat her ass if i were you" (taking to me) is clearly not helping so i yell to someone to hang up the phone. this girl breaks free from me grabs her phone and starts calling 911...operator answers and she says nothing, it's the same guy i had before so when i grab the phone he tells me to go inside, i tell him she's going to run into the woods and he says so let her (lol). at this point she cracks me in the face again, so i'm shouting at 911 "yeah any time the cops could arrive would really help right now" while i'm saying this she grabs my arm and tries to bite me, now my boyfriend steps in and makes her sit down and holds her there. (he was talking to our landlord and his wife as they had now also come outside) now the cops arrive (who doesn't love seeing their ex husband at 2am 3 days before christmas...am i right?!?! but that's a whole other story)...she runs to him (thank god) he grabs her and puts her in the back of his car without asking us anything, so naturally she starts flipping. she was attempting and successfully climbing through his divider and smashing his computer (lol i had to laugh) so he rips her out and hand cuffs her before putting her back in. i go inside as it's freezing and they will come talk to me right? i'm watching from the window now. ambulance comes, they strap her to the gurney and cart her away. then all the cops leave. no questions....so whatever i'm going to bed. guess they assumed i didn't want to press charges 🙄 now i'm laying in bed, icing my face. sent boyfriend to check is upstairs guy was okay...he returned with 2 cans of dog food and some human (as in not dog food) jerky...guess upstairs guy was thankful someone came to the rescue...even if it was initially confusing who actually needed said rescue. acid is one hell of a drug kids. tl;dr: though girl was being attacked, instead i was. edit: paragraphed edit 2: clarification 1: yes first arriving cop was my ex. i'm just that unlucky that he happened to take the call...or am i? 2: sounds like he didn't question anyone/take statements and told upstairs neighbour to go back inside and all the cops left. 3: upstairs neighbour told us it was acid when i first got involved. he also told the police and my landlord the same thing. that's all i know, i do agree it's not a typical reaction, acid is usually a goooooood time.	0

numbers saved as mummy and daddy by a stranger on my phone. it happened a year ago, a stranger i used to chat with asked me if i was going to class that day. she lived 500 miles away, so a random conversation followed and she told me that she wanted me to go to the mall. the mall was nearby and so i was walking towards the entrance when she showed up on the opposite side of the road. she was short and looked somewhat similar. she took me inside and had me chatting for an hour about her new bag. she asked if i wanted to go to the movies, nd there i was in a movie with a stranger. midway, she held my hand and took it over to her thigh which was an immediate red flag. i pulled off and she was pissed. the evening went on till she bought me a pizza. while i was off to recieve the order, she was fiddling with my phone. i usually save contacts with their names, and mom and dad were saved by their respective names. she managed to change the names into mummy❤️💖❣️, and daddy 💖❤️❣️, and i noticed it after i came home... we never met and we rarely spoke after until after 7 months when she asked me if i was doing good. i still never changed the names... tldr: girl i let on the internet showed up in my city and changed contact names on my phone, also got me pizza.	0

getting arrested after trying to be a good friend. on mobile so apologies for formatting, throw away account because this happened thursday and a couple who know me and my story also use reddit, an old friend of 20~ years messages, after about half a year with barely any contact. friend apologises for it being out of the blue, asks if we could get drinks. - type of friend where no matter the time in between conversations, it feels like no time has passed between meets. - ask if everything is okay, find out friends partner of 4~ year has been cheating. it is now my responsibility to get said friend understandably drunk. explains story in person, drink doubles all night while discussing/catching up. end of the night comes (or so i thought,) flag taxi, drop friend off first - literally 3 minute drive from my house. somehow in this 3 minute journey, i managed to get out of the taxi 1.5~ minutes away from my house, lose my passport and proceed to be locked up (and taken to cells 15 minutes away) for drunk and disorderly (according to officers for my own good, i wasn't a harm to anybody) and receive a nice ps90 fine! but hey, my friend had a weight lifted off of their shoulders for a few hours 😅. tldr; tried to be a good friend to a friend going through a breakup, drunk too much, lost passport, got arrested and received a ps90 fine.	0

why and how can i do this any longer? widowed!! one child still at home. my own health issues. i only have my income. i have a very physically and emotionally draining job. fast pace and demanding. 12-14 hours a day!! i push myself to get through work. i don't have other skills to find a job that will pay enough to survive. my days off are spent making myself do the necessities. i ache!! i am fatigued. in pain. i have to rest just to make it back to work. the stress and physical demand flares up my condition. i have to pretend to be ok at work as everyone is counting on me!! i can't do this forever!! i have been pushing myself for 2 years!! i just want it to stop. there is only one way to make it stop!! no one is going to help. there is no one who will/can help. i can't live on part time or without health insurance. just work, hurt, pay bills, recover as much as possible and start all over again. i miss my best friend!! we worked things out together. i worked but not to the point of extreme exhaustion. i didn't have every task at home as my own. he was so much stronger than me. then tragedy.......... should have been me. i told him from day one, "you are an angel here on earth". i knew that he was to perfect to be blessed in our golden years. 20 years went so fast. i just want to be with him. wish our son didn't have to live this horrible reality. he needs his dad. 😢😓	1
i(28m) finally told my best friend that i like her(26f) so i(28 m) have been really good friends with this girl (26f) i met while i was in london for a year. ironically once i left london our whatsapp and facebook conversations became even more frequent and we got to know alot about the turmoil in each others personal life. somehow we got closer with time. today while talking to her i just acted like i was asking for a relationship advise. asked her how do i tell my best friend that i like her without risking losing her. she said tell her that you like her but if she doesnt feel the same way you would still like to be friends with her so i just told her the same thing copy pasted. she was immediatly like "i had a gut feeling it was me hehe okay, since we're cool and awesome, i am.happy you told me straightforward, and i will keep.that in mind, i respect and cherish that, and whatever happens, if i end up sharing the same feelings or not, we'll stay friends" "we're still cool.right? 😎😎" "if it's meant it will" "we keep that in mind" "no getting rid of me easily" "and may god play whatever destiny we're meant to have" now frankly speaking i am confused.. on the dm she looks quite cool with it. but i am afraid if shes really fine with or not. i moved to dubai 2 years back and she is now in romania. we still talk to each other about our deepest fears, broken family, ambitions and pretty much everything. she is still talking to me though sorry for the long post. stuck in the friendzone and worried 😂. i dont know what to do next,dont wanna loose a friend either 😂 the long distance kinda makes it difficult, but whenever there were tough times she was there for me to advise and help me get through.	0

prey instead of trying to enjoy me, the only way for them to destroy me is through my mind -i have nobody to trust, to run to when i need help or care, i have trust issues -i feel like cutting because it's so satisfying and letting the blood flow is great -i will suffer forever in order to make people around me feel good but i don't matter -i need to bite myself hard and bleed -i feel like people are after me -i hate this society i have anxiety -i wish everyone dropped dead and would leave me alone -i dread being alone and in silence, there is no one out there that actually cares about me -i fear the future because of so much neglect and negativity that people put on me and it will be tiring to constantly fight for what i have to say and do -i hate this world and that i have to suffer along with everyone else then die -i will never feel better or be myself again -life is controlling me and i want it to stop -stop going after depressed and suicidal people -dying is for freaks, losers, weirdos and weaklings like me -i feel like every time i wake up i can't stand life for making me feel alive by forcing me and keeping me trapped, i want to sleep for long periods of time -i want to fight anyone and everyone by ripping them apart piece by piece -nobody likes me and nobody ever did and nobody ever will -i support misanthropy and antinatalism -i can't deal with society, i must stay isolated and reserved and die without notice -i wish i could kill people instantly with my thoughts so they could leave me alone but that won't work -i cry and cry and fidget and fidget -my brain cells are loose, ready to explode and bleed -i have emotional breakdowns and act differently in a fine way around people than when i am at home -i want everything to stop, i want to stop breathing -i feel like yelling and screaming through my walls of pain -i feel like having massive panic attacks but instead i want to end my life in drain -people kill me everyday by being around me carelessly but kill me even more when they don't understand me or acknowledge my existence -my life is not worth living and that when i die, i won't matter anymore -i feel so out of place in this life because nothing is working -i am not surprised by how many people i seek help and care from who don't actually care about me and acknowledge my existence because of who i am, i wouldn't want me to continue being me or having me around especially around people -nobody cares if i died why do i still bother living, no one would even look back or remember a girl like me if i died -most of the time people make me find the habit to want to scratch them and bite them or maybe even myself -depression and loneliness are my best friends because it constantly reminds me how much i put myself down, how much of a failure i am, how much nobody likes me or needs me, how worthless and hopeless i am and how much attention i don't get because i'm a stupid girl who's been always rejected and looked down upon in disgust because i'm not someone to be cared for, or attractive nor worthy to be in anyone's presence nor successful or productive enough in my life -i'm constantly surrounded by people that make me feel like shit by doing things i have no control over, even in my own home -i really want to stop living, the universe can't care enough for me, nobody listens or takes me seriously, life doesn't give me what i want when i want it -love is not real and that my life doesn't have it and i'm not worth it in this life cause after all i've been alone for too long that i'm beginning not to want love anymore -i don't want to live anymore and i want people to stop forcing me to live -i feel so dark and empty and hopeless -i want someone to guide me to make me feel happy but that's literally impossible -i'm not feeling like my old self like i used to, i feel way worse than before -i feel like i will never get what i want in life because of the amount of competition, selfishness and negativity in the world as well as people who voluntarily annoy me by doing it on purpose by not taking me seriously whenever i work hard on something or put my good points on a important subject -i feel like if i died life would be better -no one is helping me or supporting me, i'm drowning in my own waters of pain wanting to die in shame, i find life pretty lame -people need to leave me alone, i'm tired of life owning me and taking advantage of me just to feel good about themselves while i lay clueless and lost in my thoughts and feelings -i really don't care about anything because life makes me angry, sad, emotional, lost and tired that i'm beginning to want to give up on living i don't want anyone to love me, i don't want anyone to care about me, i don't want anyone to be looking out for me, i don't want to be anyone's main priority, i don't want to be anyone's responsibility, i don't want anyone to do anything for me -i keep everything inside my head because every time i want to talk about how i feel and what my thoughts are i feel afraid, judged, overlooked, not taken seriously or even cared for and lastly pushed around and manipulated -as much as i want to cry i also want to die because i'm sick and tired of being sad, ignored and hopeless and emotional while in society eyes i act neutral while also pretending to act like everything is fine -death is my best friend because it gives me the option to just forget about everything because life is not worth living -i don't have a relationship with life because life hates me, treats me not importantly as well as dismissively and treats me badly and i constantly feel like death is my only option because it feels nice -when i die, nobody will miss me and even if they do miss me they will have to forget about me especially as years go by, i'll be history and no one will remember me especially 100 years from now because i'll be long forgotten -i'm too much of a coward to even take my own life but i really want to die because i don't want to stay in this life -my parents are annoying and i have friends that are not supportive that aren't great to rely on or trust because they betray me or they always come and go and that i fail to have any good ones and looking for sympathy on the internet is a dumb useless option because of pointless comebacks and solutions that make me feel worse and even more alone because there's no hope in me getting better -life is not worth it, its meaningless. i am trapped by living and there's no way out -if anyone recommends medication i will overdose on it because i hate life forcing me to live with all this pain i have left unsolved -i don't feel supported and loved by anyone in the universe, all i have is me -i feel like i'm not living my life well because i have no one -if i died nobody would care or acknowledge that i exist or miss me at all, everyone picks on me by bullying me, blaming me, being selfish, pretending to care about me when they are just simply taking advantage of me or like others use me for profit -if i died now how many people would care about me, the answer is 0 because anyone and everyone has their own lives to focus on and no one will ever have time for me or even think about me -i don't want anyone to help me or care about me because that's too much to ask for and no one really does care about me because all they want to do is annoy me, make me feel bad about myself or just ignore me and leave me be, i'd rather be miserable and not let anyone know how i feel and what i want and how much i'm suffering in life -fuck me, fuck my parents, they hate me and i hate them, they make my life miserable and continue to abuse me and disrespect me and not give me what i want -everyone is absolutely worthless and meaningless cause in the end nothing really matters -i cry in my room alone because i'm so fucking pathetic, lonely, and miserable and a terrible mistake -i should've died when i had the chance -i want to hurt everyone because everyone hurts me, targets me, bullies me, takes advantage of me, messes with me, pisses me off and constantly provokes me with insults and explain unconsidered unhelpful solutions to me -i get blamed for everything, i don't fucking want to live, i did not ask to be born and yet here i am in this stupid miserable annoying meaningless life on earth -i hate this life and nobody cares if i have anxiety, loneliness, depression, and lack on my mental health -everyday it gets worse and worse it doesn't get better -no one cares if i think about suicide only when i actually do commit suicide then they care but then they all forget about me later on in life because they have themselves to focus on, death happens everyday and it's not taken seriously, its literally the least important topic to talk about -i don't really cares what happens to me because i don't have any strength to better my life nor protect it -i want to be gone. when i die, i don't want anyone to miss me, i don't want anyone to find me, don't plan any careless funeral or search for me, my life is not important and not for anyone to control, i don't belong here on earth, nobody will even know i existed or died because nobody cares -all there is are professionals such as psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors doctors and hotlines etc, they could all break their necks and perish, people who fucking get paid and benefit because there's no one else to care about me spend time with me relate to me, talk to me, or know me truly and it really sucks that people recommend them as the only option to go to when people like me should have friends and family to enjoy life with but i don't, but most people do, nobody gives a fuck about me -i wish i could die early perhaps starvation would hurry up the process -i don't care if anyone gets hurt when i die, where were you when i needed care and support, where were you when i suffered, cried time to time felt worthless and crazy, not listened to or needed someone, always unwanted always picked on and abused and instead of life being with me life's against me, no one to help me, so i do everything myself. -literally can't stand life all the time, i'm trying hard not to be depressed and feel darkness but there's no relief and no cure and i will never be happy and thats okay, this life is not for me -love, friends, and family, dating, marriage, togetherness, luxury, and care is for normal happy successful people, not for me because i'm less deserving and i'm a killer who is bitter on the inside along with being sad and tired on the inside and pretending to be positive on the outside because i can't stand life. i will never smile again or have a positive outlook on life, all i can think of is slowly dying and being locked out of this reality in a deep sleep -i feel unworthy, ignorable, dumb, stupid for being in this life that doesn't need me -i don't like being in this life that makes me feel worse than i already am -i don't want to be cared for or pleasured, and that nothing matters besides pain and death -i will never have anybody in my life ever again -my head fucking hurts so much that i can't relax because all these thoughts are running around in my head rapidly and it won't stop -i have nobody to spend time with me, everyone has someone except for me because i'm dumb, stupid, worthless, reserved and nobody ever takes me seriously and always alone, something i have no choice to change and absolutely have no control over myself -i never tell anyone how i feel or open up to anyone especially in real life because i'm afraid they will judge me, report me, take advantage of me, leave me alone, ignore me or just simply put me down and can't understand me because they can't relate to me -i don't care about life and i don't want anyone to care about me fuck me, fuck life, i hate this world, everything is meaningless and should stop existing -i don't have any friends or family they eventually come and go or i just never had them in the first place, i'm forever unsatisfied with my life -no one would ever like a girl like me or actually care about me because love is not real and life is pointless, no matter what i do in life i always end up with nothing, this is a curse i carry -everyone hates me and doesn't care about me because they have their own lives to worry about, no one really has time for each other so why would anyone have time for me and make sure i'm ok -i have no friends and family because they are all fake and they always leave me alone and are manipulative and mean towards me, they never check on me, all they want is my attention, time, work and care but its never reciprocated back to me -fuck money, fuck love, fuck friendship, fuck family, fuck success, fuck this world and all life living in it. i tried so hard living and giving everything a chance and doing all that but i could but it always points back to being miserable and hopeless because nothing works, i only get through life by doing what i like doing because i have to not because i want to -i write how depressed i am every day and nothing ever changes, life is still the same -i don't want anyone feeling bad for me or caring about me because people are just pretending or aren't that serious, why would anyone care for a girl like me or pay attention to a girl like me when there are people worth caring for and are worth the time and effort, i deserve nothing but emptiness -everyday all anyone does is talk as an act of care and show no action expecting others like me to feel better about themselves when it never works -i feel like the whole world is against me and has someone like me to step on and push around -i always feel like i have to better myself in order to stay on top of anyone in order to avoid being a loser and to stop being needy -i have nobody to spend time with or talk to for a long time. i do that with myself cause unfortunately i'm not important to anyone and will never be on anyone's mind -i stop trying hard to get attention, to please people and to force people to understand me as well as to meet others expectations. nobody cares about me -i'm forever alone -life would better if i was just gone already, people would benefit, be happy, celebrate, still have a great time and laugh because they have other things to look forward to, me being gone would make people care less, save them from worries and pressure and less to no stress, sorrow or grief because people only care about themselves, cause in a selfish careless society we benefit off of ourselves and have other things to focus on -i only stay alone because no one wants me around and people would rather see me suffer than to do good in life. -my life is a waste, everyone is doing better than i am, i'm stuck struggling, feeling miserable all while doing everything i like to avoid being bored -i enjoy nothing because nothing helps me get better whenever i try to feel good i always end up sad and emotional -i have nobody that really listens to me and people purposely fail to make me feel good by making me feel worse -i like loneliness and depression because it reminds me how terrified, miserable and emotional i am when i step out into the world because no one accepts me for who i am or understands me or pays attention to me and so i don't need anyone and that i will never be able to fit into society and have a social life ever again the fact that i'm treated worthlessly and unimportantly is because i don't matter -i want to be alone and not have a chance of being with someone and even if i want to be with someone i'll never be good enough for anyone cause they could always have someone else -i never ask for help or care to assist with suicide and depression that i have in order to avoid getting the same and or predictable useless unnecessary advice i don't want to hear, being taken advantage of, ignored or even worse, blamed for how i feel and told to get over it and being manipulated, reported, insulted or even screamed at which i don't want -the only time when everyone wants me around is when i'm dead -when i'm dead and alone or not i don't want anyone to miss me, nobody would miss me if they realized i wanted to die and besides they would care and just get startled and make them stay away from me more or just not care or just tell on me without really understanding me or hearing what i have to say. when i'm in my death bed in peace unable to wake up and its confirmed by the doctors, i don't want anyone to come to my funeral nor say anything positive about me because no one knows me because i don't matter in this life nor was i ever for this life -i can't imagine anyone falling in love with me, why wait for love when love is not real, relationships is for happy positive people who are lucky, not for depressed people like me who spends so much time alone and will never be good enough for anyone -i will always be bored and unsatisfied with my life no matter what i do there's just not enough stimulation -i never get what i want and that's fine, i'm doomed for a mediocre life -i will never call on anyone for help on trauma, suicide, fear, depression, anxiety because no one understands me and so i keep it all to myself -the world has no heart, everyone has to create their own path of change to make it better other than that people will always remain the same. cold heartless, cruel, selfish, and evil. -it's okay not to be okay, i will always hate my life because i'm not satisfied with it, i'm searching for endless roads on how to feel good and it never works -i hate guys, they make me feel stupid and vulnerable for thinking that they could even care about me or solve my problems, make me happy and give me what i want when i'm only risking myself to get hurt, abused, cheated on, heartbroken and disrespected and that's the game everyone in a relationship have to face and so do i but i never liked a guy and none will ever like me if i liked one. -nobody gives a damn about me, i'm ignored, treated badly and people treat me as an invisible person and constantly treats me like garbage by insulting me and putting me down because they think i will never do better than them and that when i go places people won't accept me instead they will always use me for their own personal needs and to meet their expectations only, that's okay though because its a matter of time that i won't have any confidence to live anymore -i hate my life, i'm so emotional, angry and hurt because i'm having a hard time in life and people encourage that because no one is there for me and so i don't care -seriously i don't want to live anymore, i don't matter because being born is a waste of time, energy and space, why be in a life that doesn't acknowledge me no matter what i do, my parents are so fucked up in the head for even having me because they are like anyone else who doesn't treat me right, constantly makes me upset and feel weak when i go out into the world -when i died... before that i was alive, i realized how many people that don't care about how i feel and continued to make me feel worse by crushing my will to live because by caring about me they wanted to know what's in it for them or completely left me alone and continued to shame me for who i am put me as a disgrace by making me feel alienated from the rest of the world -everyone is an enemy and needs to be destroyed or just has to leave me alone because i'm having a hard time with life -i am not sad and i don't think or act negative all the time but that's beginning to be my personality in order to get defensive against anyone. i am positive but not as naturally positive as i used to be, i'm only positive and happy because people make me and to act like it but i don't feel like it -i am always taken advantage of and pushed around, i give so much to people and i never get anything back but pure disrespect and carelessness just after i make people happy and satisfied -dying is good because i can't handle life anymore -nothing is a good distraction for me, nothing brightens me or cheers me up or makes me happy anymore, everything is just boring, gloomy and the same -life is the worst thing i ever experienced, there's nothing good waiting for me, there's no great other side there's just darkness, falling into a deep hole into the unknown, i feel like everyone i know will be gone and people i know and others who are around will be gone -living is hard, dying is easier -i'm pretty sure i can't escape my problems, issues, how i feel and being around people because i'm still alive -if i died or disappeared it would be like no one saw it coming -for someone like me who is suicidal and depressed its hard to tell if anyone actually cares about me -if i died people will pretend to be my friend, to act like they knew me and to say all kinds of nice things about me when all they really did when i was alive was ignore me, pick on me and talk behind my back all the time, take me for granted and just tolerate me, not take me seriously or have long conversations talking about all sorts of great things nor have any plans to hangout with me and to make sure i'm okay -i have nothing, i am a nobody and no one wants to deal with me, i'm a stuck up hopeless attention seeker who bothers people or just constantly scares them away because i'm not needed and that i'm wasting people's time when they could have someone else better that is worth the attention and time -i like depression, suicide and anxiety because most of the time that's what i look forward to, they are better because they help me stay away from life because i can't feel good -i will never change the way i feel the way i am and i will never be positive about life ever again -i will never open up to anyone on how i feel because nobody is there to listen or to take me seriously people just brush me off and don't even care and support me -my life has been a series of nothingness because no matter how hard i work i will never achieve the things that i actually want because life is not fair -i was born to not fall in love or be in a relationship because i predict my life would turn out that way because i will never be good enough for anyone -i will never be normal or good ever again, i'm secretly bad, and constantly punish myself for being in this world, the good times i never remembered or once had, being around people has taught me how i will never be with anyone because people have others to be with and others who actually care about them and benefit them and i'm only around for people to take advantage of and here i am being degraded -i will never feel good. i have nobody to spend time with nor share how i feel and there's no one i can trust -i find it hard to believe the saying " you are not alone" that's bs i'm so fucking alone and deal with it everyday and nobody gives a damn about me everyone would rather pity me, ignore me, talk bad about me or just poor into useless advice or just purposely brush me off -get a friend, have a hobby, meditate, get help etc. all i have tried and none worked and only felt even more worse -i was born to be happy not sad but unfortunately i can't stop being unhappy and that's how the rest of my life will end -nobody will be able to hear about me ever again because everyone cares only about themselves. -i walk around feeling like i'm dying trying to get through each day and each night -nothing hurts more than being ignored pushed around and not be accepted into society -if i commit suicide people would care but i won't be able to see that they care because i'm dead so it doesn't matter -people always say this option "wanna talk" when that doesn't always help. i want someone to actually spend time with me and show me how much they care about me -i have been alone for such a long time that i'm stuck in my own imagination with these horrid terrible aggressive thoughts -i feel so disconnected from society that nobody would even notice if i was gone -people die everyday, people will grieve for me and then they will forget about me and later on in their lives they will die too then i will be forgotten -i seriously don't get how people live so well in this life, are happy and satisfied when life is so meaningless and the good people like me has to suffer and the ones that live better are the people that are evil or more fortunate than me -i want nobody to care about me and i don't care what happens to me -i have nobody to celebrate with or distract me from spending time alone -i have a hard time with life so i keep every single problem, issue, complaint, and thought along with my depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts to myself because no one wants to hear me -people always joke about suicide and depression in addition to not taking those subjects seriously, well joke even harder as well as ignoring it, we all don't care about each other anyways so why would anyone care about me -nobody cares about me and thats good, why be born in a meaningless world when everything i do leads to nowhere -everything in life is bad, there's not one good decent person out there in the world who is decent enough to actually like me, to listen to me to or care about me, all i get is abused, insulted, ignored and controlled - i don't wish to die by suicide but it feels like the only option because there's not a better option -the people at school would be happy and lead happy lives if i was dead, besides no one really knows me -depression is one of the worst problems to have in the world, its like living in poverty. it only brings out the worst in me and not best in me. depression watches me suffer and blame myself while my pain unravels itself -everyone is pretending to care about me just to fulfill their own needs because they think they know what's good for me -everyone gets depressed, so what nobody cares and life moves on -people get to know me but they don't take me seriously -i have these feelings and thoughts and hinder them because nothing matters and i won't get better and nothing can change the way i feel, i wasn't born to feel this depth of sadness but it somehow still continues whenever i try to get better -love is not real, why would anyone love a girl like me, life is meaningless, i will be alone and die alone knowing that i had no one who truly wants me for who i am -i don't want to face people, i don't want to go to school, i don't want to be at home, i don't want to go out and be independent, i don't want to socialize, i don't want anyone to like me or care about me i don't want to travel and change the world, i don't want to cry anymore i don't want to listen to anyone's rules or get taken advantage of because i'm so sick and tired of life and as long as i'm alive i'm suffering, i just want to die or at least have a chance to restart my life and end up having a better more positive life than the one i'm having now -i really don't have so much to live for because i have nothing special to look forward to that could keep me going and interested in living life -i don't care about life and no one can make me care -suicide prevention is a big fat joke and it doesn't really help or care for anyone, it doesn't even work for me -everyone is heartless and careless, and treats me like dirt -being ignored is all i'm good for -i carry the fact that i am a burden -depression tells me that no one cares about me, no one will come to rescue me or check up on me, that i will never have a good future that i'll always be worthless to anyone i come across and fail to be accepted into anything society has to offer and that i'm doomed for hopelessness -i want to die by suicide because i can and that i don't care who gets affected whether it's at school, at home or anyone else outside of that. i don't matter and i should die -everyone is doing better than me in life while i'm here trying to live and attempt to feel better hiding the fact that i will rot slowly one day knowing that i had no one in my life to help me, care about me, check on me, and spend time with me, everything moves on rapidly and i'm slowly getting left behind. -depression wins, depression always wins and suicide will finish the job -i have no friends cause if i did they wouldn't last -i feel so useless, everyone is better off without me every time i try to be helpful, people don't acknowledge what i have to say or do -i hate all people and i will never feel connected to anyone, only disconnected -no one would ever appreciate me or like me for i am treated like a monster or just super avoidable -i can't stand living why am i still here? i hate this boring reality and nobody actually cares -i can't hangout with people or socialize because i get left out, made fun of, humiliated and manipulated so i avoid working and talking with people all the time, all together and just get used to working and talking all by myself. -people i used to be with eventually forget about me -every time i talk to people they interrupt me ignore me or get lost into being uninterested to even want to continue the conversation i'm having with them -there's no love, friendship, and human connection that can distract me from being addicted to death -every time i explain to people on how i feel they think i'll have to get over it, that life will be better and that all my problems and issues are temporary when it's really not. i can feel so hurt and depressed for a long time and forever i will be -nobody actually takes depression and suicide seriously because no one can handle it and people constantly fail to listen and understand anyone because most people doesn't understand what its like to be depressed and suicidal -i feel endangered or at risk by everyone that could be secretly against me and wouldn't help me if i was experiencing a crisis -i'm not bad or aggressive, just overprotective and less confident in a lot of situations -i honestly don't know what i want in this world which is, someone to spend time with, money, success, love, great possessions, pleasure, fame or death. nothing really matters because i can't choose because pain erupts and my mind is rolling all over -i don't want anyone to love me or care about me. i simply want anyone to fuck me over again and again and let me die, love is nonexistent in a world where there's no peace -these thoughts and feelings are not real but i feel like they are and it keeps building up -people like to encourage me to constantly make me feel angry and depressed over and over again and it makes me tired to livid at the same time -depression makes me want to go against. everyone who continuously makes me feel worse but instead i keep to myself and bottle everything up -running away from my suffering problems and issues is always the solution but eventually comes back to me -maybe i was meant to be alone, i beg not to be born every day since i'm in this life might as well deal with it knowing i'll die alone knowing nobody that i could've had special times with or checks on me -when i'm alone i always get told by people to occupy my life with interests, hobbies and i always get bored quickly doing them knowing that i will still be alone doing things by myself while people actually have someone in their lives that cares and does fun things with them and i don't -i wish someone could take my life for me so i don't have to do it on my own -people who care about me are the ones that leave me alone all the time and doesn't want be with me every time i want them around -dying is better than living because nobody cares about me. everybody dies, so what? life moves on -i don't depend on anyone because there's no one that actually listens and understands me and actually takes me seriously, cares about me or needs me -i don't want to spread misery to anyone because when i grow up i want to die, i had no reason to be a part of this life and i certainly don't want to take a chance to continue living in this life in the first place and i don't want to live in this life and for anyone to not see how meaningless and awful it is to live in this life is clearly mindless and oblivious to what life really is, which is bad and not good. so i want no part in this world and it is my duty to end me so have a nice life everyone cause i don't want to be living in it any longer -i don't feel welcome at home, at school, in crowded places and everywhere else, i am in the middle of nowhere, no one to trust and no one that can make me feel needed -i am angry at the world but most of all angry at myself i shouldn't have made the decision to live -everyone will care if i died but they didn't are enough about me when i was alive and needed someone me and everyone one else doesn't care about each other and mean nothing to this world that we're living in, we will all be gone one day -explaining to anyone about my suicide depression and loneliness is like explaining to a wall that doesn't understand me because it blocks any of the information being said and can't imagine what it's like to go through these things that i feel -people say you need to reach out to someone to talk to, someone that loves and cares for you, someone who wants to be friends with you, someone to spend time with you and do things with you when no one is actually there for me -if i just died now i would never have to experience pain ever again all while not existing on earth -everyday i get more depressed, it feeds more on my negativity and makes me incapable of doing well in life -when i go out in the world, i'm invisible to everyone and feel like no one wants to hear me or even deal with me because i'm not worth paying attention to -i wish i was never born so i don't have to experience this meaningless life -i don't think i could ever live in a life where there's love because fuck love and fuck me too for living in this life -everyday there's more pain and i don't think i'll ever feel better about myself -therapy is so useless that's it's so stupid and annoying, like find a better job people, you only get paid to care about people it's not like you actually care because you have no heart. that's what these people are all about -when i'm alive no one is around to make sure i'm ok and to care about me and do things with me but when i'm dead everyone wants to come around and act like they cared about me but they never really did -is it ok to go through life pretending how i feel? i find it ok and so do others because no one will ever accept how i really feel because they don't accept the real me -i think i will live my life in solitary because i have nobody that is truly with me and can't depend on anyone and i can't make people accept me no matter how hard i try, i'm only hurting myself by doing so -i will never get to experience what it's like to be truly happy and not sad all the time -life is not happy, it's harsh, cruel, miserable, lonely, annoying, meaningless, worthless and bad -me being born in a world that doesn't understand me no matter how much things i do or say and i hate my parents for giving me birth to experience my life on earth when they could've taught me to be strong to care about me to help me instead of causing arguments with me and to actually preparing me for the real world instead they shut me out and doubt my capability on anything and fail to acknowledge my needs as well as my as existence -everyone needs to understand that they are against me and not with me because as a smart intelligent person i can't trust anyone unless i feel like they can understand me and relate to me as if they are me because they're feeling me -i have no friends and family -i follow depressed and suicidal people on reddit and instagram because that's all i can relate to -i don't want anyone to love me and i wouldn't want to love me either because i can't imagine what its like to be loved -i don't like people who judge me for stupid unnecessary things and who constantly put me down on the things i do and fail to see how capable of anything i can do -life is this huge heavy weight i carry on my back everyday and constantly puts me down -my my whole body hurts so much that i can't function properly -i hate love, i hate how i'm not having enough of everything i want in life. -life is suffering death is cure i'm already dead i should just die and get it over with so i don't have to handle myself being alive anymore -there's no way i'm going make it in life because of the manipulation of other people -we are all spiritless creatures born to die and so am i -everyone is so so stupid and annoying in life why strive to do anything when nothing matters in the end -people constantly take my spotlight and provoke me from being good into showing the evil side of myself -i am not going to listen to anyone because nothing matters and i've gone through so much stress, crying and headaches to the point where i just want everything to stop -i hate everyone and everything, there's so much suffering and pain in life and i didn't even ask to be born -i hate life, i hate how i don't get what i want, i hate how i'm treated. -when i'm dead and gone i don't want nobody to talk about how much they care about me, want me or how good i am, when they should've been there for me and how -i should've reached out- when nobody came for me to understand and stood by me if i was alive. -i go through life constantly being dead even though i am alive -people care only when i am dead but when i'm alive they think i'm happy and that my depression and suicide ideations is fake -people don't care when i'm around and when i need attention because everyone treates me bad and ignores me like i don't matter. why should i prove myself to show how important i am in life when there are better people out there than me -i hate living then having to suffer and die, why do i have to be born in the first place when i don't care about life and life doesn't care about me -i forgot how to socialize well because its been a long time since i had anyone to be with or talk to -i don't really care about what anyone thinks about me nor do i want attention and i don't care about being alive anymore because my life is meaningless -no one cares about me unless i'm pretty, famous, rich, or dead but none of that really matters in the end because i like anyone else would be forgotten -i don't want to be in this life because i don't get what i want. i feel resentful that people have the courage to make it far in life and i can't. why should i keep pushing myself so hard in life when everything i do doesn't get me everything i want -life hurts every time i find the strength to live because i can't handle how i feel people think depression is fake and a joke when its slowly killing me inside make me want to lose the will to live -i am sick and tired of people who don't acknowledge my existence and then constantly make me feel worse by pissing me off -as long as i'm still living i will suffer for long periods of time because i can't stand to be in a life that is unfair and doesn't care. i am alone and always will be and not everyone knows what its like to feel like this -nobody knows how many times i've cried alone until i was tired and couldn't cry anymore nobody would bother to read this, nobody should read this. this post might not even last, besides nobody cares why am i still here. i should leave this world🙄😔	1
tell me a story i love story's! especially true ones from strangers! i'll begin: when i was six(ish) my family took me on a cruise. it was a really fancy adult cruise and i was only there because they were friends with someone who worked there(or some connection i don't really remember) there were two giant pools on the main deck that i swam in every day. i've always been a good swimmer so sometimes my parenst would leave me alone while they grabbed a drink or took a pee or something . one day i got into the pool and after a few minutes i realized i had to go to the bathroom. my parents weren't around and i didn't want to get out and worry them. so genius younger me comes up with a plan: 1) swim to the corner of the pool 2) go underwater 3) create fecal matter 4) have it sink, and since the pool was mostly empty nobody would notice at least until i got out unfortunately that's not how things happened. shit floats, which is something my six year old brain had not yet learned. so instead of sinking, it floated to the surface. and guess who happened to walk in as soon as that happened. my parents. i tried to deny it was me but i was one of three people in the pool. so i was banned from the pool for the rest of the cruise 😬 anyways, tell me a story! it could be funny and embarrassing or sad or whatever! can't wait to hear them!	0

i need to have sex 😡 why did god make me so unnecessarily horny?	0
i always feel uncomfortable i'm not very good at being social. i'm a shy person but not on purpose. i'm kind of an introvert but not because i want to be alone, i wish i had friends. i probably have social anxiety. i've always been teased and alone and this makes me think that i'm not too good. i'm too ugly and weird. it is being confirmed by the fact that i'm always alone and getting teased 🤷‍♂️. this makes me feel so uncomfortable, like i lost at life. the fact that it has always been like this and that i try my best to look good and try to get friends also made me lose all hope. i just wanna be able to live life but i can't change my thinking and not be ugly... i only (kinda) talk to one person that i know in real life (but don't see) and that person is also my crush :/. i find it hard to talk to her now, i am just not good enough : i got no hobbies. i tried but i can't get into something. i can't make friends. i joined places but no success. basically, i have a hard time with people. i feel alone. i have a history of being alone and being teased. i'm too boring and ugly for the girl i like. i always feel uncomfortable (ps sorry for messy format i just wanted to write down and share my thoughts)	0

going on a drive to clear my mind from a bad break up i went through a real bad breakup 2 days ago and i have been so sad. today i went to dinner with my uncle and decided to go for a drive by myself after to help clear my mind and distract it. but when i was driving i drove past my ex and she saw me. to make matters even worse my friend olivia texted me and she saw on snapchat that my ex went on a date with another guy. if you thought seeing both of her once was bad, when i turned around later i saw her and her new date both together back on the highway on their way to go somewhere. it was the worst coincidence ever and it happened twice. i am even sadder now and don't know where to turn. my friends would make fun of me and i don't have much family to turn to. taking that drive made everything worse and its so sad to see her go on another date with someone so soon after 😢😢😢😢 tldr went on a drive to clear my mind from my ex and saw her on the road twice and saw she was with another guy just days after we broke up	0
my roommate is the definition of a choosy beggar my roommate is so disrespectful i can't believe i've lived with him for 6 months. i knew it was bad since the first bit i didn't want to kick him out so soon and thought that maybe i'd just have to get used to it. nope, he's so disrespectful. he does things i ask him not to do. he acts like i'm trying to control him for mentioning *anything* to him. there's this constant tension between us because i'm nervous to speak up and he's always got this tough exterior around me because i'm the fucking bad guy. if you're not gonna take orders from me, don't live in my fucking house! i let a poor guy move into my condo with me so i could get a taste of the roommate experience. because i didn't dorm in college and felt like i missed out in an experience and making friends. well i got it, and i think i realized how i might've been to some people growing up too. he literally said that "i go to work and take orders all day, i don't wanna come home and take orders too." well if you don't want to listen to me, don't fucking live with me! i'm the fucking landlord in this position, and i told him, like i have a certain way i do things around the house. i want to keep it similar. no shoes inside, close washer dryer room and turn on fan when dryers on. every house has a way to do things right? there's a reason, they're not fucking arbitrary. it's like he can't follow orders, he'd be terrible in the military, he does everything i ask him not to do, unless i ask him twice. and he acts like i'm burdening him. on top of that, he ignores me whenever i text him. which is like, less than once a week mind you, because i know he's gonna act like i'm the asshole. he says he's busy. why don't text me back an hour, two, three, four, or bring it up when you get home? so rude. why is he making me the enemy? we're not gonna get along this way and he's not gonna win, because i own the fucking place. on top of that, he acts like he owns the place. expects to use my shit without asking. he literally said that "i'm not gonna ask before eating your peanut butter." and that's fine, we've discussed it and now we share pb, but that doesn't excuse the months that you've been eating my food without asking. he has no fucking respect. i don't know why i let him live here. and last time we had an argument, he had the audacity to say he was a good roommate. why the fuck does he have this attitude? he also used my oil, spices, shoes, and other things that he assumed he could just use without asking. complete lack of respect. reminds me of my whole life. yet i'm in a position of power now, but i didn't want to be an asshole about it so i didn't bring it up. but here's something for you, with power comes responsibility- and that responsibility is to be an asshole. bring it up, i don't care how they feel about it. i don't know what it is about people which makes them not respect me, but it makes me feel so worthless. but that's another topic. speaking up feels so good 😈 it's gotten to the point where the last six months have been some of the worst of my life. do you remember that ulpt where it said that "enjoy work more by making your home life toxic."? ya that. i feel like i've recessed as a person. receded into my shell because that's how i handle a situation. i've lost friends because my attitude was shitty. and i've started to feel like i'd be lonely without him, almost like i've gaslighted myself. (voices in my head doing that actually, but i don't believe them or advice i get from others because they don't know the circumstance. the reason why i've been with him for so long). but i was fine alone. it reminds me of my relashe with my ex gf. we kept breaking up because she was terrible, but kept getting back together because i didn't know what else was out there and always gave second chances. he's so pathetic when he tries to act nice too. i can't stand it. anyway, don't get a roommate from craigslist who doesn't respect you. and always make the lease on a one month basis, so you can pull out when you want. like i did, but i still didn't pull out until 6 months, and hated every month. such an asshole in truth, it does get better- which made me doubt myself more. we get along as long as i don't bring up any of my grievances. but i'm not in it for the long haul, this isn't a relationship. if it's not working out now, it's not working out, i don't need the money. i could rent it out to somebody else for more probably. it's been 6 months and if it's not good yet it's bad.	0
i finally cut off a toxic person for some backstory, ive known this girl for 4 years and she was kind of the only person i hung out with for those 4 years. but after getting some new and better friends i see that she wasn't that good for me. she would never text first, didnt ask how i was, didnt care about her future. it was very hard but im proud of myself, i never thought i would do this and im glad i finally worked up the courage to do it. thats all thanks for reading 😊	0

this sub should be proof that they need to start teaching lgbt+ history in schools. the amount of straight guys who think they know anything about being lgbt+ on this sub is very annoying. all the time i see you straights saying things that you think are right but are lowkey homophobic/transphobic/any type of phobic. you's need to learn about what we go through and what our type of people used to go through before you can tell us stuff like "oh saying "straggot" is just as offensive as saying "f****t"". i hope schools start teaching stuff like this soon because the straights need to be taught. anyways cant wait for you straights's lovely, annoying and borderline homophobic comments❤️❤️	0

i don't know how to kill myselfshould i overdose? too unpredictable. should i hang myself? i don't see a good place where i can hang myself cause i am fat as fuck and i need a really strong support. should i jump off a bridge? sounds like a good way to go but i don't have any bridge around that is high enough for me to be able to die. should i shoot myself? no gun allowed in my country. should i cut my neck? i don't want to die in a disturbing way like that. should i cut my wrist and bleed to death? i like the idea of bleeding to death but i never cuted my wrist and the scar would be horrible if i survived. i just don't know what method to use and i am not sure if i wanna die.😕	1
i am walking on the edge... well... it's my first post here and i don't know how i should say everything. i am a girl and i am 16. since the first grade i have been an outcast. i was chubby and wore glasses and apparently it was enough of a reason for the others to mock and bully me. in these types of situation usually parents would be supportive and loving to their kids telling them that they are perfect the way they are, but no. not my mom. she would always tell how much of a failure and disappointment i am and that i am fat and this is why i don't have a boyfriend. but a few hours later she is the one that is trying to hug me and stuff, like nothing has ever happened. now i have anxiety and depression. i am thinking about suicide more often. and my mother, now that she is suspecting my depression, she is blaming me for it. she says that i am ungrateful and says that she is pitiful. quote: "and what are you going to do now? cut yourself? commit suicide? after everything i've done for you?". in her eyes i am the worst child in the world. right now while i am writing this, she is talking with my aunt and she says that she sacrificed her youth for us (me and my brother) and that i am such ungrateful, bad and horrible child. the only thing that stops me now from committing suicide is the guilt and shame that my dad will affect the others, that if they will even be affected. p.s. i told my "best friend" about my problem, she brushed it off and said "and what?". i regret telling her. i sincerely hoped that she will help me. edit 1: i am amazed that there are people who care. i am thankful for your kind words. your words helped me go through some rough moments and made me truly smile. thank you very much! 😢	1

what to write to family and friends? i don't want them to think they had any part in what i'm going to do. my family and i aren't close. they moved across the world ten years ago when i was 20 and haven't visited or anything. i have no close family or super close friends except people i've met online. every day i just feel so much loneliness it's unbearable. i went from being engaged to absolutely nothing, no career nothing and its been nothing but crushing loneliness in my life for four years. i would have done it years ago if it wasn't for my two lovely dogs who i adore with all my heart. it hurts me so badly to think what will happen to them but i just can't do this anymore. 😔	1

just got over my ex, feeling pretty great 👍🏼 it's been roughly a year and a half since my ex girlfriend and i broke up, most of that time i've been in a lot of pain and have constantly been checking her social medias out of curiosity and hurt. recently however i've realised it's an important part of life to grieve loss, and while i appreciate our good memories, when i think about her now i feel nothing. and day to day i just feel pretty great about everything. just wanted to share, hope everyone is doing well!	0

okay, i need to get this off my chest please tell me i'm not crazy okay, i need to get this off my chest. tell me i'm not crazy. i'm currently 21 years old and i was raised on the internet. i was pretty hot and attractive in highschool but i always decided to go for guys i met online instead. when i was about 16/17 met this guy in a chat room. he was about my age. he always asked me to visit him and we were getting really close. we got along really well and video chatted then one day he just disappeared on me. years later i was 20 years old, this was in summer 2018 and he reached out to me. at this point i had no profile picture and i removed him as a contact so i knew he really had to dig to find me. he said that he was sorry he stopped talking to me and that he hurt a lot of people and that i was the one he felt the worst about hurting. i have the philosophy in life (which i will probably change after all the bad experiences i've had) to try my hardest to make things work so i never regret not trying my hardest to keep relationships... so i forgave him, and boy do i wish i didnt. we were talking somewhat consistently and i was going through a strange breakup during this time and recently quit a bad job so i was really grateful for his attention. we talked on the phone a couple of times and he started saying that he wanted me to visit him again, mind you he lived 10 hours by plane away. after a couple of weeks of him asking i finally said yes. i started making plans but i was trying to keep it away from my parents because i didn't want them to worry. as the time came closer my parents kept getting more and more involved and he went mia for about a week. at this point it was less than a week until i was supposed to leave, this dumby even booked off time, and i told him i couldn't go. he said he was sad but that it was okay and i was going to let it go. the next few days following i felt like my father and the guy wouldnt stop telling me how much they wanted me to go so i finally said fuck it and i booked the tickets ($2000 both ways) to see him. this is a lot of money for me, i am deffiently not made of money so the entire thing was kinda a big deal for me... anyways my entire family figured out i was going to meet a stranger the night before my flight and i was screamed at all night about how stupid i am ... basically it felt like i was being disowned by the family. the guy i was going to see also was hardly responding to my texts so i barely slept that night thinking about how stupid i was. which i admit, i am pretty dumb. i realize i should not have done a lot of these things and i'm working on being less desperate in dating. anyways (lol) i fly to see this dude and he picks me up at the airport and right away he looks like someone i want to punch. he looks like the absolute worst version of his pictures but i am just happy he has picked me up at the airport. we walk to his place that night and he is pretty standoffish but in my head i link it to his nerdy exterior. thinking, he is probably just a nerd. anyways by the time we get to his place i am pretty tired and we kinda roll around in his bed a bit... like actually roll around not sex, idn it was kinda weird but also felt fitting for this weird spontaneous moment.... but i sleep cause at that point i am a bunch of nerves emotionally and really tired physically. so the next day, i wake up pretty early and i try to give him h*** (are we aloud to talk about sex on here....?) and i end up puking on his d because he went super rough... like extremely. this guy is a self admitted (no i am not lying!) sadist mind you. like i been with some freaking and dominant guys and i'm into some weird stuff and i'm pretty kinky but this guy.... like it felt like he just wanted to hurt me. even when we kissed... he bit my lip and it felt like razor blades. i even grabbed my lip in pain cause it hurt so bad, then he like forced my head down there and then the puke... ya! you get it lol!!!! (fml i am just cringing at myself) but ya he freaked about the puke, which ya know i puked on 2 d's before and they were wayyyy more chill. he literally started gagging as well 🙄🙄 like bro!!! man up! anyways he forces me to shower and then i force him to wake up because its noon and i didnt just travel all that way to puke on some d i genuinely wanted to see the city!!! so we go out and we walk/ bus through the city. which was probably the best thing to come from my entire interaction with him... we walked 40 000 steps that day (fitbit squad) just to give you a broad idea... anyways i would say 10 000 steps in he gives me a real fucking shocker. this mother fucker tells me of the 7 days we were supposed to hang out he can only hang out 3..... are you for real?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! fuck!!!! dude i almost passed out. that was probably the most shocking experience of my life holy balls man.... you travel 10 hour plane spend thousands to see someone and then they basically kick you out. i was flabbergasted. i still am, how can you do that to someone? he tells me to change my plane flight ect or to stay in one of those sketchy places where people sleep together.... mind you offers to pay for absolutely nothing and wont let me stay at his place when he originally said he would pay half of the flights and would take me out ect. i never got mad at him, the entire time i stayed with him i just asked him questions and i laid out the situation from my point of view. every time i tried telling him how he essentially screwed me over and that i even went against my family to see him he never seemed to feel bad or apologize he just acted like he did nothing. that is the thing that bothers me the absolute most. i am extremely forgiving and would have forgiven him he just never cared to make an apology. anyways the rest of our hike he talked about himself and his life the entire time. he talked about his life and his experiences and how "rich he was". he would say the most ridiculous things like that his dad is a millionaire and he parties on 100 thousand dollar boats and goes to the states every single weekend and when i would ask "really?" he would say "of course". of course, like it's the most obvious thing... like... this guy told me so many crazy stories and nothing adds up to the point that i genuinely believe this guy is a sociopathic compulsive liar. i listened to all his shit stories and even smiled when i really was so irritated with this clown. i even bought him a drink halfway through our walk because he was too cheap to buy himself one..... anyways, my world was shook... my mind was blown... i felt like i was gonna pass out it was a hot mess. we got back and i needed time to myself. i stayed in his room for a while just trying to figure out what to do, i had never been in a situation like that before. i needed help and i was not going to confide in my family and i (tbh) do not have a friend to confide in like that... so ya know, i went to tinder. i told people in the area my story, more condensed than this and they all said that this guy is a douche. at this point i started to realize they were right and i became furious. my emotions finally caught up to me and i just wanted to be away from him. he tried coming in the room to talk and i just glared at him. he left and became angry himself in the other room. he furiously did his dishes which is a stressful thing to watch... anyways once i calmed down enough i went to the room and i asked him legit questions, about where i could stay, why i couldnt stay w/ him ect. and... i cant go over everything but every response was upsetting trust me. he kept lying about why we couldnt hang out and even told me that he already told me he couldnt, which is the only thing i really stressed... was that i knew i knew he told me he was free. several times actually which he later admitted.... i noticed a girls stuff all over his apartment which he says is his ex's so how i'm thinking he is still seeing her. he plays video games and screams while i try to sleep and is all around annoying. anyways at this point i'm crushed but everyone on tinder is being really sweet, (which was a new experience for me) and told me to be strong, spend time away from him, figure out the situation and not let him ruin the trip for me... so i listened. i went out and honestly, every day i was there i tried to keep a friendship with him. i wasnt looking for a relationship w/ him to begin w/ anyways just a good time. all he needed to be was decent and i would have been happy. i kept asking him to go do things with me but he never did. not even a meal, or a drink. i booked a hotel and now i'm like 3-4 000 in.... way more money than i intended but thankfully i dont really care about money as much as other things in life so i am okay with the money i put in, it was just a let down. on the final day i spent with him early in the morning i went to buy a coffee at a nearby place. i listened to the new paramore album to try and balance my emotions specifically the song "24" (good song). when i came back i was deciding what to do and i told him i was tired but i wanted to visit the hotel and pay for my room ahead of time. he was sitting on the couch and in the moment i decided to do a me thing and try one last time to fix our friendlationship... i sat beside him and put my head on his shoulder and i apologized... i put everything aside and i apologized... i just wanted him to stop treating me like crap. he pushed me off him he didnt really accept my apology and kept giving me weird facial expressions.... he then slowly pushed me towards the door and told me to go pay for the hotel... mind you it was about noon and i tried to hug him but he pulled away and slowly closed the door on me... i know i am pathetic. so i went to the hotel and paid and at that point and with advice from the tinder peeps i bought a hotel for that night even tho he would have let me stay. i just could not spend one more second with that pig. so i bought a hotel for the night it had a super nice view+ 2 king beds, cause why the hell not i was already way over budget and i felt like i needed to treat myself extra well after being treated so poorly... i was done and i went to his house, packed my stuff quietly and quickly... like 10 mins tops and just carried my bag to leave i didnt even want to say goodbye because every word he said was like a knife and hurt me more and more... i couldn't take anymore. he said "you still have 1 more night" i said "i got a hotel." he asked to take me to the hotel, i said "i think i can manage" snarkily and he was like... "oh okay"... his face then turned bright red, he then went to give me a half hug and i just peeled his arm off like the dirty diaper it is and took my suitcase and left.... so ya that's the last time i saw him. the days followed which turned out to be very good. i posted pictures of my adventures on snapchat (which he followed me on) and he never bothered to check in see how i was or apologize. i never removed him as a contact because he was the contact my parents knew if something went wrong and i didnt want to freak them out if something went wrong god forbid.... the entire thing is strange. all he needed to do was apologize..... i dont understand. he showed absolute 0 care for me as a person. i was super nice to him too and spending all that money/ traveling to see someone/ forgiving them is a pretty grand gesture i would say. before my flight left i texted him that he is a horrible person and that he treated me horribly. i talked about how he never apologized ect. i was extremely angry... i still am. he never responded and when i got home this silence angered me i couldnt believe it. not even an "i'm sorry" so i kept texting him how horrible he is... later to find out he blocked me. ouch. anyways this angered me even more to the point of hatred which is where i'm at now. i went on his different social media and spammed them saying stuff like "you're a c***" "i hate you" "you're a horrible person" "i wish i never forgave you" "i wish the absolute worst for you genuinely" ... being myself i would come to ration and start asking legitamate questions again like "why" "how can you do this" "how do you not feel bad.." ect..... he responds to some messages in the most snarky, point blank unsympathetic way addressing absolutely nothing and simutaneously blaming me. calling me names, calling me pathetic, telling me to get over it when all i want.... is a reason... you know??? do any of you understand ??? please..... tell me i'm not crazy i hate him now, genuinely. i think of him randomly and yes it has been months and my blood boils. this hatred is so real and i want to let it go but at the same time this hatred is so real... he will block and unblock me and i will just spam him that he is a horrible person... idn, i know that its lame that i do that but it just makes me feel better knowing that he knows i hate him and how angry i am. that he cant get away with screwing me over that bad and treating me bad and not have any consequences... i mean he can i just feel better that he knows how bad he hurts me.... i do this once every couple montha and i met him last sept and now it is march... the last time i did this he said "it's been months and you're still messaging me" and pretended to be his own gf and the gf said "i'm a pre-law what are you?"... and just the past few days that last statement keeps running in my head... i feel worthless. that's the problem, he makes me feel worthless and maybe he knows that and maybe that's what he wanted to do.... i plan on not messaging him anymore and it's not like i was doing it to win him back... i was just doing it because he hurt me so bad and i would think of him randomly and would feel the hatred and would need answers and i go over this in my mind none of it makes sense!!!!!! he refuses to even apologize and i guess the moral of this all is.... am i crazy???? i know i shouldnt text him anymore and i wont... i do want to let this situation go but this hatred is extremely strong so its going to be hard and... is it wrong that i hate him so strongly??? i know this is long i just hope someone reads this 😭😥😔 please give me some advice or any type of comment if you have read this, it would make me cloud 9 happy and if you have.... thankyou so much ❤️❤️. i hope no one treats you the way he treated me.... you are valuable and deserve love, happiness but most of all respect.... i have become a bit of an angry person towards my family and even small things like traffic recently. i worked in fast food for a year and had many situations like this in dating where things just go wrong every way possible and was bullied all throughout my life for my personality, i'm unique so people dont like that... but i want to be a better person, i want to let more love into my life/ heart and i want to let go of all this anger and unhappiness. it will be hard but i've been through much worse. wishing you happier hearts than mine right now, thanks to anyone who has read this far.... please comment if you read this would love to read !!!! haha oh ... and ya best thing that came out of this situation was puking on that guys d just saying!!!!!! tl;dr: i met a guy online years ago. he disappeared for years, came back, apologized and i forgave him. after weeks of talking i decided to visit him. i took a 10 hr plane ride + spent a lot of money to see him. when i got there he told me that i could only stay half the week that we agreed upon. he spent barely any time w/ me when i was there and even started telling me to leave the house and do things without him during the day. he was super rude and lied and treated me very poorly.... he never apologized for any of this and months later i still hate him and send him messages telling him how much i hate him and he messages me back telling me how pathetic i am. i'm just wondering if it's wrong that i'm so angry with him? is it okay that i hate him strongly??? i'm going to let it go but this was such an upsetting experience and i just wanted an apology or explanation....	0

no bad days right now the soft pitter patter is jamming against the window. the world is quiet. serious vaporwave vibes. confoundly calm. even though i have every reason not to be, and i think that's what's making my mood that much more pacifying. my favorite time of the day is when everyone is asleep. when i can breathe and the air is fresh really early in the morning when the birds are chirping and not a soul is outside or late at night, when i can go out and sit in silence - except for the sound of cars passing by. or the train. i feel that way about the entire world right now and it's really really.. nice. i'm pregnant! hold your applause everyone. don't hurt yourselves trying to congratulate me. it's not staying but like worse things have happened. mistakes happen. roll with it people. when you have unprotected sex and you have a lot of sex and you cum inside me a baby will happen. i know that's how it works, but do you? so there is something growing inside me. undeniably. i knew i was pregnant before those lines turned pink, like something inside me changed. i'm going to figure out how far along i am but fuck i am pregnant. can't stop peeing. eating literally everything in sight. tonight i had seafood enchiladas with polenta sauce and beans and rice and an entire bowl of 8-layer bean dip meant to be eaten with chips. i gave into those separately but equally. fuck food is so good. swiss cheese with salt on it. chocolate chip cookies. dude. ice cream. i can feel it in me even though it's so smoll. feels so fucking weird. now that i know i'm pregnant i'm giving myself so much grace. no wonder why i was so emotional. no wonder i had no energy. no wonder i've been such a light-weight and one edible sends me over the m🌚🌕n. i get it now. i am not lazy or crazy just having a baby 🎶 but now that i'm not in denial about it i feel strangely good. i had the best day at work today i've probably ever had and not because the customers were different. i'm different. the world is different now that i'm pregnant. this is a whole nother trip. what is important to the world isn't what's important to me any more. i feel like i finally understand my mom. i understand everything. i understand what she did what she did for me and why she put herself and us first. i need to desperately start doing that more. nothing matters anyway but now that i'm pregnant i'm finding solace in the fact that.. i matter. right now i have precious cargo but dude i'm precious cargo too! why didn't i realize that before? i should be taking care of myself like i'm pregnant always. i should be eating. peeing. not drinking. not smoking. i mean to an extent but like i need to put good things into myself. i feel like since this enormous burden has been put on me and in such a traumatic matter fuck killing yourself. fuck drunk driving. i matter. i like actually matter and i want to be here. no bad days! this is all a blessing. even the mistakes. life takes you where it wants you to go and this has been such a learning experience. even though i have to undo my pregnancy in my own.. even this experience in life has been a blessing; i'm not sad it's over i'm just happy it happened. i feel that way about this too even though i do think i can blame myself for part of it but what's the point. we're here now. on one hand i think.. i should have had more self respect than to ever let him fuck me without a condom. ever. i don't know why i instantly thought we were different. i have never let a man do that before. i'm not a cum dumpster. nice fetish but actually i'm not an object. when i said i was too high on acid to fuck we shouldn't have. i shouldn't have said what i said but i'm not something you're just using to masturbate with. sex is something deeper. like god.. hot sex is connection and awareness of the other person and pleasing them because they're there and they want it. lately i haven't wanted sex because i felt disassociate. i was missing information that i'm pregnant and now i feel at one with myself again. sex with him was something deeper when it was that. i always thought i was infertile but then again no other man has made me cum the way he did before either and i have no idea if that has anything to do with it. goodnight	0

i give all of you so much credit for what you are going through 💙 in most experiences, when it comes to someone passing, people come out of nowhere to be there for you shortly after the death. they come and visit, go to dinners, keep you company... but as time goes on, people fade away. mostly all of them do, except a few. people act like they care so much but in the end we know most won't really be there. people talk a lot but they don't truly stick it out. with that being said, i have a lot of respect for all you going through this type of complicated bereavement. idk how you do it knowing that some who you thought really cared to stick around don't. you are all amazing people for being able to endure this process. 💙💙💙 and in case no one has told you today, i am really proud of you and all the progress you have made. 💙💙💙	0
my [26f] mom [55f] accidentally irreparably damaged my car without my permission background: i'm currently living at home working part time for six months before returning to grad school in the fall. this whole ordeal started because my mom's car was on the fritz. she asked to borrow mine that day to get to/from work while she was having it towed/looked at. i said yes, and she proceeded to ask me the next three days to do the same. it was very inconvenient and she could have been a lot more respectful of me and my time (once asked at 11:30pm when i was already sleeping over at my bf's and she needed to leave at 6 am -\_\_-) but whatever it's my mom. however, four days after this all began, at 10:30pm, i get a text from her stating: >it is with great sympathy that i must report that your car is dead. it died earlier and i have been trying to revive it since 2:30 ish. it will be towed to (auto shop) later. i was planning on renting a car until mine is fixed. you can take it in the morning. i don't know what will happen after that. as it turns out, my mom used my car (prius) to jump my sister's \[28f\] car, and then my car died. they spent the whole day trying to get it revived behind my back (hoping they could fix it and tell me about it later). while i don't know much about cars, i know that i would never have tried using my prius to jump another car because it runs differently. more importantly, i **never** would've taken liberties like that with someone else's car they were letting me borrow without at least contacting them first. i would **not** have approved this had they asked me first. surprise surprise we later learn from the auto shop that you should never use a prius in that way, and that repairs are going to cost an amount neither i nor my family can afford. aka i'm most likely out of a car. which stunts my ability to work part time. and i have to find different housing for grad school. not to mention the death of my social life these next couple months... :( i have a lot of building up feelings of resentment towards my mom about the entire situation. i'm angry that she felt so overly comfortable when borrowing my car that she 1) assumed i'd be able to drop everything and let her use it whenever 2) did not contact me before attempting to use my car to jump my sister's car 3) did not feel the need to tell me in the moment that my car had died, only when she knew there was no getting out of telling me and 4) she never really apologized or took responsibility -- using language like "your car died" vs. "i killed your car". i can't help but speculate that the attempts to revive the car after the fact also made it worse, which makes me even angrier that she didn't at least tell me at 2:30pm that my car was dead. obviously my mom didn't kill the car on purpose. plus, i'm staying at her home rent-free for 6 months, and while i know she enjoys having me here, i know is not something to take for granted. if this were anyone else this would be a different story. i have what i feel are justifiable feelings of rage, distrust, and disappointment, but i don't know how to let those out when it's my mom. i don't want to just let the resentment bottle up, but i also know it won't go away on its own. am i being reasonable faulting her for this? am i allowed to demand an apology? should i not try to be angry with her just because she's my mom? am i allowed to ask she put for the effort and resources into finding me a new car? do i have to just suck this up and move on? i think i'm just grasping for some feelings of control over this situation because at this point i've had none, but i'd appreciate any and all advice so i can stop alternating between seething and crying to move on 🙃 tl;dr: my mom was borrowing my car and used it behind my back in a way i wouldn't have approved of, which led to it being essentially totaled. i'm absolutely furious, but know it was an accident and don't know how to proceed.	0

well, i'm trying my father left my house long time ago, he tried to harm my mom so she left him. i'm proud of her. i had a step-father and he left us to. i'm not sad about it, i didn't actually accept him, i disliked him so i guess it's ok. but lately, my sister's anorexya and 2 of my mom's friends got cancer, i feel like i can't handle it anymore. i wanted to live a long and good life, studying forest auxiliary (google translate) and wanting to become a firefighter to help people, but i feel like i can't help myself anymore. i wanted to be productive all my live, not because me, i used to like live, but my firts goal was my family hapinness. now it looks like an imposible goal, and my life looks usseless, as i can't keep anything up. i lost contact to good friends, the only one who i've talked to is a computer freak (like i used to be), but he does not care about my personal issues. i feel so ashamed of myself. i want to be strong, i want to be the pilar that holds my family togheter, i want to help other people, but i just can't help myself. i won't ever kill myself because it would be 2 hard for my mom and aunt, but i'm losing hope so quickly, i just want to become invisible or something like that. it's so hard. i'm sorry for the long post, and sorry for my bad english. i used to care about my mistakes and so but actually i just care about my sister and my mother. sorry if i've wittren some misscence words, but i'm drunk and hopeless. listening to rock songs so i can get some hope. just sorry for wasting your time and wanted to apologyze. hope to see you soon. thaank you 💔. edit: actually i'd like to die with something like an overdose, so my family believes that it was my fault, not theirs. i was just a piece of shit, and i was so stupid. if nobody can cheer me up, i hope somebody can give me advice with how to kill myself and look like and accident. i wan't to suffer with my death, i wan't to feel my last feelings.	1

what do people mean by self-love, self-hatred and other stuff related to self synonyms? hey everyone, i see these synonyms a lot, mostly on quotes, and i don't think i know what people mean by that. like what does 'self-love ' meaning? or 'self-hatred ' ? and how can one know if he's one of them or maybe something else? i know it's a stupid question, but answers would help 😃😃😃😃	0

its 2 am, heard a loud noise in my house and now i'm overthinking every little noise i hear could potentially die soon 😳😳😳😳	0
guess i'll die i'm an extremely fragile person. when people complain about special snowflakes™️ ruining everything, they're referring to me, and people like me. someone is a rude in a video game and i get triggered. someone teases me for something innocuous i do and i get triggered. someone tells me i need to do better and i get triggered. someone sighs or looks at me in a certain way and i get triggered. i get triggered into constantly thinking about how worthless i am. it doesn't help that i'm legitimately terrible at everything. every time i fuck up, or someone does something that shows me that i've fucked up, all i can think about is how i've failed. i've failed as a teammate, a community member, an employee, a family member, a student, a friend, etc. sometimes i lash out at the stranger who triggered me (i'm the cause of this problem), but most of the time i recognize it's my own damn fault for fucking up again. because of all this, i can't handle any type of job that involves dealing with people. i've seen first-hand that strangers, especially customers, can be cruel over the tiniest things. as you can imagine, for someone whose day can be ruined by a single "lol u suck", i get destroyed when people get pissed at me in-person for yet another one of my fuckups. it hurts even more when i know they're right. i did fuck up. i should be doing better, but i'm not. it's my fault and *yet again,* i failed. i'm also extremely lazy, beyond what i can reasonably say is just add or even depression. after a certain point it's delusional to blame it on something else. i'm just an extremely lazy person on the inside. obviously, this meant i flunked out of almost every college course i tried to take. it's been six months since i've had classes, eight since i've done anything for them. just today i managed to get into a fight with my mom because i was too lazy to pay to gas up my brother's car. all i had to do was throw on some clothes, sit in the car, and slide a credit card into a gas pump. i said i was sick of doing things for other people. that's how lazy of a person i am. nowadays, i literally play video games all day at my mother's expense. aside from eating and showering, i have no responsibilities whatsoever. she's practically broke now, trying to feed my lazy, cowardly ass. i am the perfect storm of being suicidal for no apparent reason. i'm fragile and can't take criticism. i'm lazy and won't do anything useful. i'm terrible at everything and *can't* do anything useful. if it wasn't apparent from my writing style, i'm also the obnoxious whiner that everyone hates. i'm also broke and can't afford treatment (no i don't qualify for discounts or free anything). there is zero hope of me ever being a good person. the world would be a far better place without me. even if i were to get over my laziness and cowardice and go get a job, there's no doubt it would drive me to suicide. all paths point to suicide at this point. any attempt to delay it just extends my suffering from my own shittiness. i am going to kill myself. i don't know how, i don't know when, all i know is that it will happen. i know i'm beyond any support, so i'm just posting this here to air this out.	1

riding my bike into my friends it was a beautiful afternoon, i was at my mate's house afterschool with about 5 others, and we were playing football (soccer for the american folk) out in his frontyard. we finished a while later and, absolutely knackered, lay motionless on the grass. for some reason, i felt this burst of energy that needed to be relieved after a while, so i hopped onto my mate's bicycle and started riding around the street adjacent to his house. i was picking up some pretty decent speed, and decided to bike in the direction of my mates who were now sitting on the steps in front of the house, and brake just before i hit them. pretty routine thing, i've done this before. it was all just some good friendly banter, right? i started biking in their direction, and hit the brakes about 5 meters before so i could stop in time. to my misfortune, the brakes must have taken offense in my treatment of them and decided to just cease to exist. at this moment i knew i was fucked and tried to slow down with my feet, but to no avail. my mates managed to move out of the way last second, and my bike hit the steps just as i was in this awkward diagonal position trying to jump out of the way, which could honestly not have been worse. i fell forward onto the steps, the handle pressing against my abdomen, and heard a fair share of 'what the fuck dude' before it hit me. i felt a searing pain explode all the way up my genitals. it ran up my entire body and all color left my face. i jumped up and sprinted into the house and to the bathroom, for some reason deciding to yell 'i think i cut my fucking cock off', much to the amusement of the others. this was obviously met with laughter that i could hear from the bathroom as i furiously tore my pants off which were drenched in blood. it was all a big fucking mess, blood coming from everywhere, but i had no idea if the johnson was still intact. i started yelling bloody murder, and his father ended up driving me to the hospital. that was the most *bloody awkward and painful car ride of my life, i shit you not.* end of the day, i had cuts and bruises all over my bishop, and my urethra decided to collapse on itself. i'm catheterized for a month or so, meaning i'm basically peeing through a tube up my dickhole. apparently there could be permanent damage, but its too early to tell if my tallywhacker will ever be the same again. oh, and my cunt ex decided to confess how she no longer has feelings for me that same day. and she wouldn't believe me about my injury, thought i just wanted sympathy. only gets better from here, lads :) tldr: broke my weiner edit: jesus christ this blew up. thank you everyone for your kind words ❤️ should have used a throwaway in hindsight... edit 2: nevermind, i regret nothing. edit 3: my gold cherry has popped. my knob and i thank you, kind stranger. edit 4: three golds? i am not worthy of this luxury ;_; ;_; ;_;	0
been jerked around by guy[m18] i'm [f19] talking to? last month i started talking to this guy on okcupid. he's was really sweet and we shared a lot of the same interests. since then we've talked non-stop all day every day. every morning i wake up to a good morning message from him and he's the last person i talk to before bed. about 10 days in i asked if he was interested in meeting, and he said he would be eventually but not just yet. i said that was fine, and that i wouldn't mind waiting. after that, we continued talking all the time. he says he thinks i'm perfect and is just generally really flirty. sometime last week i asked why he wouldn't meet, and he said he'd like to. so we said we'd get coffee on saturday. we don't live really far from each other, but we'd still have to travel a while to meet somewhere in the middle. so come saturday morning, we were texting again, and he was saying how he was feeling really lazy and couldn't be asked to do anything. i asked if this was his way of cancelling and he just said: "yes and no 😂". the topic kind of changed after that, and as he didn't say he was actually cancelling i thought we were still gonna meet. so an hour until we're gonna meet, i'm about to leave the house, and he asks if i'm mad at him. when i asked why he said because i'm being lazy?. i asked him to clarify if we were still gonna meet, and he said no. when i asked if he was cancelling because he was actually too lazy to get out of bed he said no, and that he just looked really shit today and assumed i wouldn't want to meet him because of that. bare in mind we had been talking since 8 am and it was now 12, so he actually waited for one hour before we were gonna meet to cancel on me. when i asked when i had given the impression that i was so shallow, he said he didn't think i was and just started saying he was sorry for letting me down. what pissed me off the most was when i asked what now, he said he was just assuming i would block him and when i asked him for what he wanted he just said he didn't know. eventually, it was established that we both liked each other and i asked if he still wanted to meet. i asked when and he completely just ignored that question when he replied. i asked again and we agreed on next saturday. he tried to be funny after that, change the topic, and i just ignored it, and a couple of hours later he said sorry again. honestly, i feel jerked around and played.. i really like this guy and i don't want one stupid thing to ruin it, but i'm not sure if i should actually give him another chance. mainly because i don't think this means as much to him as it does to me, but i'm not sure. tl;dr: guy i've been talking to for a month cancelled on me one hour before we were gonna meet because he "looked like shit", doesn't seem to be bothered much and just keeps saying "i'm sorry" instead of replying to questions. should i give him another chance?	0

mother in law shows up unannounced and takes ovwr my entire house!!!! i (38/f) have been married to my husband (38/m) for 17 years. it hasn't been perfect, but we are happy and make the best of life. we have 2 teenage son's and my elderly, retired mother lives with us and shares bills and responsibilities with us. my mother in law (62/widowed/never had a job before in her life) "lives" out of state in alaska, & we are in california. she thinks it is okay to just show up at our house anytime she wants, and takes over everything making me feel very upset and angry. she acts like she is oblivious to my unhappiness, but i wouldn't doubt she knows how i feel! i don't hide my feelings well. she takes my bedroom, i am now sleeping on the floor in the extra room that my mother (72/single/retired) used for her crafts and things. i cannot go into my own room during the day because now my mother in law just lays in there the entire day staring at her cell phone games or whatever. she took over my personal bathroom, my backyard, garage, everywhere!!!! she chain smokes and i am allergic to cigarette smoke. she tries to wash her hands after smoking, but honestly it stinks up my entire house and my elderly mother who live a with us for the past 17 years, is now suffering from the smoke smell. she goes to bingo 3-4 times a week blowing money she doesn't have, and comes to us crying for money when she is waiting on her next ss check to come in. it's like clockwork each month. i don't know what to do. i want to ask my husband to have her leave, but he won't take it lightly. at this point, it's either her or me, and i don't think my husband deserves to have to make that choice. can anyone please give me some advice on how to let my mother in law know that she just isn't welcome to live and take over everything in our home??? it is ruining my marriage and honestly my life. i am miserable when she is around and i feel like giving up on life. she smothers me and doesn't leave me alone about anything. i try to stay respectful, but am at my witts end. please help me reddit family.😭 tl;dr: my mother in law shows up at our house from our of state un-announced and takes over my bedroom, bathroom, and everything basically without care. how can i ask my husband to tell her she is not welcome to do this anymore?	0

how do i figure out who my "secret valentine" is? probably won't keep this up for long, and this is totally some 1st world problem shit... i'll also try to keep this as short as i can without missing any key "evidence" lol and i should preface that maybe i'm overthinking this because i've dealt with someone stalking me in the past... so i was out most of the day yesterday, a friend gave me his tickets to disney on ice for my son and i, went to get lunch with a friend before that, but when i came home i had a note on my screen door that a florist missed me and to call or come by to pick up my delivery. so i went to the florist this morning because they are close enough to my house. it was 2 dozen red roses with a card that only said "to: danismilealot, from: your secret valentine". now, not to be a dick whatsoever, but any men close to me know i'm not a roses kind of girl, not to say i don't appreciate the gesture, but that cancels out basically any ex or man i dated for awhile. a few friends would have my address for various reasons, get togethers at my place, christmas cards, presents for my son etc; but not enough to narrow it down. i'm not dating anyone, but i do talk to a few men but nothing serious, they all know i'm not looking for a relationship. sooooooo.... what are good ideas to find out who did this? i don't think asking random male friends if they sent it would be appropriate... i was thinking of posting on instagram with the card and no caption and just wait for a message 🤷🏼‍♀️ should i even care if i don't want to date anyone? what if i just don't think i want to date any of my friends because i don't realize that they would treat me better than my ex did, because of my major trust issues? i would like to be able to thank the person though. i think i'm over thinking it, but any creative ways to figure this out would be appreciated. not trying to sound ungrateful, but i just seems really random and suspicious.	0

i bullied a fat kid into giving me his tennis racket some background information before you go to the comments to murder me for that. (also be prepared, this story is extra phat) so the fat kid in question: he's in my school year, and has been for four years now. in our first year when i was a massive loser we were friends, but i never liked him. i always found him annoying, and his worst trait: pathological lying. he once set up a 'vr experience' for our high school fair, advertised it with pictures of oculus rifts, but when you went in (after the non refundable deposit, of course) it was a google cardboard, and you had to provide your own phone. if it didn't fit, too bad. he puts the 'fun' in 'no refunds'. he also set up an amazon account pretending to be a testing company to get free products. what i'm trying to say is this guy is an asshole. complete wanker. but this is all in the past, so i put it behind me for this year. he's probably changed, right? so my tennis racqet went missing about a month ago, and i've been forced to use a spare which isn't my size. fine, i'm pretty stupid and i probably lost it like i do almost everything else (once i lost 3 coats in 1 week 👍). so i'm chatting with my friend in the lockers when i see fat kid. he already changed for games and is holding his racqet. neon orange/almost red, white, gold and black hexagons on the inside and a scuffed top and handle. huh... that almost looks like my racqet. me: 'hey (fat kid), can i see that racqet for a second?' fat kid: 'no.' *storms off out the room very quickly* and by this point it was set in my mind; this was my racqet. so i follow him into the room and repeat myself. fat kid: 'can you just leave me alone' now this was unusual. we had been getting along alright up until then, not like we were friends, but i tolerated him and he tolerated me. but this was different, he was instantly shutting me down, not even trying to explain himself. by this point, he knew i knew. me: 'can i just see the racqet. i lost one just like it a few weeks ago, and i just wanted to make sure you didn't accidentally pick up mine.' i thought i was being perfectly reasonable here, i was giving him a chance to back out of this with his dignity intact. and i honestly expected him to just give it to me then. i would. but shock horror, he didn't, and repeated himself again: 'can you please just leave me alone.' i was slightly taken aback, and sort of walked away like i had given up. instead, i walked round the corner to the other tennis people and overheard a section of conversation. 'did you hear? fat kid called (black kid) the n-word' perfect. everyone knew it, fat kid was denying it. no surprises there. so i walk up to them, and say: 'hey guys, fat kid stole my tennis racqet, wanna help get it back.' so the now four of us walk round the corner. they start getting mad at him for the n-word incident, then, when there's a pause, i say: 'also, could i get my tennis racqet back?' and the chat explodes. he starts getting all defensive, and gets up on a bench to say 'you can't prove that this isn't mine!' me: 'yeah? so when did you get it?' fat kid: 'well, i don't know... i think i was four?' (oddly specific for someone to remember that from when they were four but okay) me: 'really? cus i bought that tennis racquet when i was seven, and had just moved into the house because there were tennis courts down the road. i bought it from the corner store on the same road as me, and i have the case in my locker.' fat kid tries to get away. so he's decided that the best course of action is to try to get away from me to stop this. he walks towards the door where one person who knew fat kid stole it was blocking the exit. me: 'hey fat kid, could i get a look at that racquet please? could you give my racquet back please? he's now back against a wall with my friend holding the door shut for me. fat kid: 'could you please just leave alone?' he continues to walk away, when i get a former friend of fat kid's, and tell him about the theft. we start to follow him towards tennis, just repeating 'can we get the racquet back? can you give itsareference123's racquet back fat kid'. by this point we're pretty close to the tennis courts, and are showing no signs of stopping. we are speaking quite loudly, and there are teachers nearby, so he says: 'fine. you can borrow it for this one lesson, if you're really that desperate.' he begrudgingly hands over the racquet, and avoids me for the rest of the day. tldr: fat kid steals my tennis racquet and i, along with a couple others, pressured him into giving it back. did i handle this situation maturely? i feel like he's quite lucky he stole from me, because if it was most other boys they would have ratted him out within a minute.	0

anyone else trying out some self improvement? what kind of challenges are you having with it? i'm trying to become a more positive and likable person, especially on social media, because that's really where i'm the worst. i'm struggling with giving up my dark humor, though. just really want to make jokes about things, but yeah, sometimes my jokes have gone too far. won't get into it, but i messed up a relationship i had with my tendency to make negative and/or mean-spirited jokes. sooo, trying to be a better person. less negative and, in return, more pleasurable to interact with. i made all new social media accounts to "cleanse" myself and start anew. for facebook, set everything public and decided to friend people i went to high school with, hoping it would help me not make any of my jokes. since everyone would be able to see them, you know. but then a person from high school posted something like: "shout out to everyone who survived their suicidal thoughts this year! we're glad you're still here!" and i *desperately* wanted to comment "year's not over yet! 😉" i didn't. i managed to restrain myself. but damn, realized this might be kinda hard, i really like my dark humor... 😕 maybe it'd be better to find another outlet instead of completely stop. either way, i'll keep working on it. 😊 so, what about you guys? anyone else currently trying to change themselves for the better? what kind of unique challenges are you having with it?	0

my brother just nearly walked in on me going through the gun safei've had a long shitty life that i really don't wanna go into right now. tl;dr version is that i'm 21, live with my parents, grew up poor, living even poorer now. never really felt wanted or loved by my alcoholic father or mentally absent mother, grew up getting beaten up (and, once puberty hit, sexually abused) my by older brother, who now is just a manipulative sociopath who starts conflict just for the sake of entertainment, constantly stealing money, alcohol, and drugs from me, sometimes just to start something then put it back after i try to talk to my dad about it. (god, i wish he did that with my last paycheck... i had to make it through the month on just $100 already and he stole half of that...) given that it's christmas and we're going through bankruptcy, it's a shitty fucking christmas this year. morale is already at an all-time low and my brother is pulling his usual shit of trying to start fights, pitting myself and my already-upset-and-crying mother in his usual them against us bullshit, teaming up with my dad to let us know on no uncertain terms that we don't deserve to be treated like human beings i think he heard me in the gunsafe from the shower i knew it was stupid to go there with him directly above me upstairs, but all i've been able to think for weeks is how happy they'd be if, for christmas, i gave them that gift. after all, without me, everything would be better, right? you blame all the bad in your lives on me, anyway here's hoping i can tell the real guns from the bb guns 🍻	1

going to watch infinity war, then off myself after. failure of a person, and even a bigger failure in life. most of the people i know are graduating college soon, and yet my dumb self is still in community college and struggling. all my life, i've always been compared to my younger brother, who was more brilliant academics wise and overall seems to have a brighter future. i'm just wasting space and resources, i figured if i was gone, my parents can use that future resources to reinforce my brothers bright future to come. i've also lost my bicycle from a unfortunate hit and run, that bike was all i had to show for, i'd like to think cycling helped and kept me going for a little while longer. if you made it this far, i apologize for this rant, and i bid you a good day and a farewell. this is my last. 💊	1

it's incredible how strong music can hit your feelings disclaimer: i'm a little bit drunk so my feelings may be amplified a bit, but this shouldn't take away from the point. i just got some new headphones and naturally i'm testing them out with some music. but godamn, music has such a big impact on the way i feel. i can feel happy and excited with one song and i can feel melancholy and anxious with the next. whatever causes me to feel this way i enjoy it. i enjoy it because it makes me feel human and because it makes me appreciate all those things that come and go in life. all those thing you take for granted, all those things that are just there at that exact time and place where you are, all those small " meaningless" things... i feel they actually contribute to all those memories and feelings that are brought back when we listen to music. godamn, life is great. being human is great🙏🏿	0

to all those who think suicidical i won't say how could i help because i know i can't as we hardly know each other and the we don't know situations we are in... neither i can feel what you feel inside because "you is you" that nobody else in the whole world can be.. nor i can push you for what you wanted because that is not what i want you to do... let's think this way.. what if you have everything? will you still be happy ? you think ? how long will it last ? let's say when you were a child you loved a toy... do you love it today? if yes how many days you will keep loving the same way you love today ? family, friends, spouse, gfs/bfs, pets all are living being and they have their own life and nature... the way you can't love everything and everyone for eternity same way nobody can love you for that long too... now, in my tradition (i am an indian) they say "everyone loves rising sun"... meaning all loves those who gives them something... another meaning is everyone one loves to who is bright from within ... go in front of mirror... strip naked and see your self... are you your body ? no... you have a body... but how beautiful it is... totally functioning... everything is perfect... don't see skin... think inside of the body... all organs works perfectly... you are alive... and capable to be live... isn't it a beautiful thing ? you are with you.. fall in love with yourself... if you do suicide then what ? as you said nobody loves you then also everyone will forget you... but who is in loss ? you... you will loose this beautiful body and beautiful life... treat yourself as your best friend, a intense lover and a guide... make a great body, super bright career/ lots and lots of money, and first start respecting your own self and your body... became a self confident "alpha" .... we anyways going to be die one day.. why to not be happy now? choose your self over others and believe me you will become a people magnet... people will draw to you... they will try to be with you...because you know what all is dying inside... they show happiness, they show family fun photos, they show party with friends in facebook or other social media sites... but that is just a 1 second of their life... but what they go through after that pic is nobody showing .... take any one thing which you love the most... example helping people.. or adopting stray animals or wounded animals... help orphan children... help homeless people... visit to old age homes ... visit hospitals and spend time with those who have no one in life... you know what people will love you from deepest heart... because all the facebook culture is showoff what real love is when you give without expecting... that the essence of life my friend.... they way you feeling inside... if you see reddit post mostly feels the same worthless, finding for love and feels alone.. what if everyone like you meet with each other in an open space like garden or park or restaurants... my friend, god loves you and hence he gives you this body and life... (1) you are healthy (2) able to earn for your self... (3) have food for eating, (4) shelter to living... believe me there are millions of people don't have either of these or all of these basic things but still want to live... don't be an enemy of yourself... there are two people who loves you... you yourself and god... be blessed my friend, i pray you overcome this phase, i pray you live long and meaningful life... i pray you be healthy and successful in your life... and i pray you love yourself .... i don't know you... but i love you... 🙏 i will pray to god for you 🙏 your unknown friend...... let me know if you want to chat... we can... if i can be any helpful to you.. i feel worth of my life🙏	1
the national suicide prevention hotline is dangerous!!! 😱 even my reddit about the suicide hotline was deleted with zero zero explanation? 😢 there's no help out there y'all!!! trust me! trust your own instincts! that's what i plan to do from here forward! the only thing i ever got fromthe national suicide prevention hotline was someone sent to my home to beat me up. and a call from one of their representatives who started having a sexual relationship with one of the teenage girls who'd called the line. i met this girl while in the hospital and she told me about her relationship with this woman. how her mother didn't know she was gay, and how this representative from the hotline would fly here to see her and have sex with her. they apparently know how to find some real sickos just ready to feed on vulnerable young people. your chances of surviving russian roulette are better than calling these guys!	1

my thoughts on valiant hearts valiant hearts: the great war™️ or soldats inconnus : memoires de la grande guerre™️ is pc adventure game released 25th of june 2014. and made by ubisoft montpellier. ##the characters game is centered around four characters; anna, emile, freddie and karl each with their own unique backstory, motivation and gameplay elements. anna is a belgian student living in paris who volunteers for medical corps and while playing as her, you'll be healing soldiers with the mantra "a single life saved is a small victory against war". emile is a farmer [mobilized](<url>) at the beginning of the war whose specialty is digging. [freddie](<url>) is an american who volunteered to join french army in 1914 after his wife was killed in a bombing (i think of paris) and he's good with wire-cutters. karl is a german married to emile's daughter. he was [forced to leave france](<url>) in 1914 and leave his wife and son behind. you will control a different character during different chapters with only one short chapter switching controls between two characters. the dog shown in the trailer belongs to a german corpsman and helps you during the majority of the game. ##the gameplay gameplay is pretty simple; go there, pull that lever, spin this valve, etc. in any other game it would have been a bad thing, but here it lets you "enjoy" the visuals and the setting. progression is based on solving some reasonably easy puzzles. there were a few moments when i was stuck trying to solve a puzzle, but the hint system is nicely incorporated. hints are available every 60 seconds and the last hint gives you the solution to a puzzle if you fail to solve it. really, there isn't all that much to say about the controls and mechanics; they work, they're quite easy and they move out of the way to allow the player to focus on the important bits. ##the sound and visuals game looks **absolutely stunning**. really, words alone can't do it justice. it's a highly stylized game which doesn't strive to show life like graphics or have dozens of voice-actors. there are very few spoken segments in the game and the majority of dialogue is [visualized](<url>), there were a few monologues, but the main speaking role is that of the narrator. soundtrack is marvelous and the music even uses sound effects from the game. for example, there's a segment where a zeppelin is bombing anna's taxi with emile and freddie (and dog) onboard. soundtrack is [hungarian dance no 5 by brahms](<url>) and bombs are falling in rhythm with percussions while machine gun fire is in rhythm with drums. [it looks and sounds magnificent](<url>). ##the setting game, while starring fictional characters, generally follows real events. it all starts with the opening of hostilities and first battles, including the famous paris taxis transportation during the first battle of marne. first in-game battle is at crusnes which shows a beautiful french countryside being destroyed. the progress from [this](<url>) to [this](<url>) really shows what it was like for the french soldiers fighting in the opening battles when the excitement and thirst for glory gets replaced by the horror of death and destruction. the death of destruction is best shown in [this image](<url>) during the first battle of marne, and yes that *is* a trench filled with dead german soldiers and that *is* an almost destroyed forest in the background. while the game is really somber, there were a few lighthearted moments like when [karl disguised as a french officer](<url>) to reach st mihiel where his family lives. those lighter moments really accentuate the rest of the game. one of the last "levels" is the [attack on chemin des dames during the nivelle offensive and it's downright depressing.](<url>) ##the emotions for the first time in my life, i empathized with the characters. even with comically short legs and with almost no spoken lines, they felt like real people with real motivations. all of them were normal people in abnormal situations. they didn't race the clock to stop the destruction of our civilization, they didn't possess any superhuman abilities and they died just like anyone else (watch the chemin des dames video to see just how easily emile dies). during the last few minutes of the game, i bawled my eyes out. that's how huge of an impact the game and the story had on me. ##the nice touches during the game there are two things which serve to educate the player. there are [historical facts](<url>) which are available from pause menu and [discoverable items](<url>) which are usually hidden in some nook or behind something. ##final thoughts valiant hearts is an amazing game, it's available on pc, ps3/4 and xbone/360 for eur15, or equivalent in your local currency. it has a pretty unique setting as it's quite rare to see a game set during wwi, great soundtrack, magnificent visuals and actual human beings as protagonists. i can't stress enough the emotional impact it had on me seeing regular people, regular foot soldiers during their hardest times. buy it. really, just buy it and thank me later.	0
isn't it intensely interesting how so many people put forward a public view on a topic yet hold an opposite view privately? i saw a post on the front page about marijuana smoking being legalised in the same areas tobacco smokers can smoke in public and it hit me like a ton of bricks: publically, i'm all for legalise it, let people do their own thing, etc but privately i intensely hope it doesn't get made legal where i am because i cannot stand the smell. seriously, the beer garden at the pub smells bad enough, we don't need that extra smell! why are we such slaves to how people view us? 🤔	0

do any other straight guys have that one boy who you would totally go gay for - just once 😈😈😤 i have always like girls, but there is this one kid in the grade above me who could be considered a "pretty boy" - as in he is skinny, has an appealing facial structure, and acts effeminatley. i sometimes jack off to the thought of him giving me a blowjob, fucking him in the ass, sometimes even he fucking me in the ass. i'm pretty sure he is gay so i was gonna make a move this summer, but he hasn't added me back on snapchat yet. lets see what happens! 😫😫😫	0

losing a check ok. so. i received a reimbursement from my landlord (over $1000) for security deposit shit cuz we kept the house nice. good stuff. was really looking forward to having that extra money in my account asap for bills payments and such. i endorsed the back of the check, submitted it via mobile, and promptly forgot all about it. apparently the check was held for review. no problem, i've been filling out checks via mobile the same way for years and have never had a check rejected. today i got an email from my bank saying the deposit had been deleted because the endorsement was incorrect. um what? i been doing it the same way for years remember?? i call my bank, they say they changed the way you have to write the endorsement on july 31st on the back of the check!! remember how i've been doing it the same way for years?? now the old way is wrong! and i was not informed of this change!!!!! or i guess i just didn't open their email when they informed everyone of the change a few weeks ago idk!! it's okay, my bank says, just make the necessary edits to the back of the original check, submit it again, and we will complete the deposit it for you. oh. okay. easy. but where is my original check?? i search everywhere. not tacked to the fridge. not in my junk mail box. not in the kitchen drawer with random coupons and papers. fuck fuck fuck. did my cocky self really throw it away?? i start digging into the warm rotting trash full of slimy egg shells and rotting god knows what my roomies and i throw out - fruit flies dancing about in my frantic chaotic search, looked in all my pants pockets, purse, more random drawers, i'm sweating, and our exploding recycling bins (exploding cuz of another fuck up because we missed cardboard pickup last week and there's a shitload of boxes because they we had new roomies move in last week)) only to not find the damn check 😩 so i had to go talk to my landlord and look like an annoying irresponsible twerp about writing me a new check.... 😩😩 gahhhh tl:dr just swam in gross trash and had to annoy my landlord because i lost a 1k+ reimbursement check from him that i deposited via mobile but got rejected by my bank due to super brand new endorsement rules via mobile deposit that i wasn't aware of cuz i'm stupid and don't check my email enough for those kinds of bank emails or whatever	0
exposing my breast to an elderly gentleman my husband and i were at home at night and i was breastfeeding my baby daughter when he heard someone outside our house. he called out, "you right there mate? can i help you?" a man replied that he was looking for his wife and was a bit lost. damn straight he's lost, we're at the end of a street with bushland on 3 sides and it's pitch black. my husband told him to come around the front and answered the door (rolling pin in hand 😂) to see a very elderly gentleman covered in bugs and sticks. he said he needed help. we invited him inside and handed my sleeping baby to my husband so i could call the police... forgetting i had been feeding her. i stood up with my boob all the way out and completely uncovered. cue averted eyes and an awkward silence i called the police and there was a missing persons alert out for him, so we waited while making awkward conversation until the police and his family arrived. turned out he had alzheimer's so he might not even remember but it's not a high point for me tbh tl;dr with an elderly stranger in the room i handed my baby to my husband, forgetting i had been breastfeeding so my boob was completely out of my top	0

i [24m] lost the battle with her [24f] hi! i just want to share how i feel today. i admitted to my friend that i like her but yeah, she did not feel the same way. after the confession, i told her that i am.open being friends again after i have move on. she told me that she needs to think about it and if i change. throughout the weeks, i worked on myself really hard to move on and i finally did it. i told her that i finally move on and i am open being friends again with her. she told me that she does npt want to be friends anymore..what's worse is that i think she completely forgot what we have talk about during my confession. she told me that she did not tell me that she needs to think about it whether we can be friends or not. in fact, she told me about it and agreed to it. in addition, she told me that whether she told me that or not, bottomline,her decision will not change 😔 it just fucking hurts especially on the part that she completely forgot what we have talked about during the confession. that part hurt me the most. i feel so depressed today. thank you guys for listening tldr: admitted to her that i like her and she never felt the same. after i move on, i told her i am open being friends again and she told me she did not want it anymore. what's worse, she completely forgot what we have talked about during the confession. it fucking hurts	0

taking out the trash at work i work in retail. when we get our shipment we have a thousand cardboard boxes we have to throw away. i don't mind taking it out because i can get a quick smoke break in. however, before we leave we have to have the other associate do a "pocket check' to make sure we are not stealing anything. i was working manager, (of whom i have a major crush on.) anyways, my shirt was tucked in so i pulled it out so she could see my pockets. unfortunately, i pulled a little... too enthusiastically? and my boob popped out..straight out, right there in front of god and everybody. to add insult to injury, she was so shocked it was a full 5 seconds before either one of us realized my tit was literally on display for my entire store to see. i was incredibly embarrassed, however we all got a good laugh at it throughout the day and she was a good, understanding sport. on the bright side, my crush complimented my rack tl;dr: i accidentally flashed my boss while preforming a pocket check.	0

told a guy i loved him & now he's avoiding meso,i've known this guy casually for a year since we're both students in the same major at my community college. we've never gone out or anything but we're members of the same campus club related to our major (theater). we've never communicated outside of official club correspondence but after not seeing him for an entire summer when classes started again in august,my heart told me he was the one. so,having no experience with relationships or social skills,i wrote him an anonymous email. however,i might never see this guy again after this semester because he may graduate etc next summer so i though i might as well confess my love. i emailed him a week ago,signing my name to the letter. in addition,i left a physical copy of the same letter where he could find it twice,and both times i know that he ripped the letter off of the community cork board (where flyers are posted,etc).and i know that you're not supposed to post love letters there🙄 but they were sealed inside envelopes for privacy,addressed as "to so & so only" for his privacy & mine.i left both letters during times when he was there.its a very small department at my college and both times there were only about 5 people in the entire building (empty).both times,immediately after i knew he was gone i went back to see if he took them,& they were gone.there is no doubt,to me,that he took them both down.the second letter i left earlier today during a time where the building was basically empty except for the current mainstage play rehearsals.barely 15 minutes after rehearsals started (30 minutes after i posted the envelope where i knew he could see it,along with a shakespeare quote from hamlet covering the envelope,i went back to check the board and the envelope was gone.there are about 12 people in his play........he took it down.i know he took it down. last friday,i had emailed him the letter.a few days ago he skipped our club meeting on monday.my suspicion that he can't tell me to my face how he feels,either way,were confirmed because we have a voice class together tue/thurs where he flirts with his co-stars in the play & both days after class i sat in the lobby in plain view where he had every opportunity to walk over & say "hey,could we talk?"our theater department is in an independent building........he stands in front of me joking around & talking to everyone else for an hour.😳that is why i say he had every opportunity to tell me "hey......can we talk for a bit.........yeah,sorry but i'm just not interested in you".there are only five people in our theater club (me......the guy i like........and three other people) so if he skips next weeks meeting as well then its clear that he is avoiding me. my therapist has told me that his silence is all the answer i need. 😔 growing up (i'm 31,black/arab female) i was isolated (female) from society by my extremely religious fanatic schizophrenic father while my two brothers (male) ran buck wild. i have zero experience in relationships & have been single my entire life. every time i try to reach out to someone i am either rejected or made fun of. call me immature..........but i will be absent from the following two meetings to see if he even cares but i doubt he'll give a damn.😳 it hurts because i really like this guy.....but because of my social anxiety his hurtful silence is devastating to my heart. he seems like a good guy to me but to not be able to tell me "hey,i got your letter but i just don't feel the same way" is not only cruel,but cowardly. he doesn't know how hard it was for me to open up to him emotionally via that letter. i tried to protect his privacy and my dignity........& so far he has ignored me........mocking me by talking to every woman in his play.......except me (the ugly woman who wasn't cast). the director (faculty) is bias towards hot guys & pretty people overall. she's cast the guy i like at least 5 times over the past three years. my therapist tells me that "love is a game" & "you need to play the role......go out for coffee........ask him out" how weird is it for a woman to ask a guy out? maybe that's too old fashioned but i would never ask a guy out.......that's so lame. well......as a part of one acting course i'm taking we have to write a 5 minute one act (scene or monologue) & perform it during a classroom performance open to the public (mostly other theater majors). i told him not to come because of my social anxiety but being the star of multiple plays in our department over the past three years,he'll come because he doesn't give a damn.😳 guess what my monologue is about?😁 of course,names were changed for privacy.....blah blah blah.......written in the third person so its just vague enough to not call him out but clear enough to him what i'm talking about. yeah........he should't come to this performance but my therapist thinks this is a good idea to express my feelings through theater,etc. i thought for sure he would tell me not to do this,thinking it immature & childish. now i know what your thinking. are you so socially anxious that you can't face the man you love? how dare you call him a coward? this man is no stranger.........he's known me for a year but it took this summer to realize that i missed him. this afternoon,i could feel my heart being ripped apart as he (probably) threw away my letter,this time. the production (we're doing dracula) is cursed........the faculty member (director) smacked her head on wednesday night when the coffin landed on top of her as crew were moving it around so she's cancelled all her classes until next week. i believe this occurred because the universe took retribution against the man i love for rejecting me.........hey its what i think,that's all. now the entire production is cursed like macbeth.......and my heart is broken. i don't want to hear any bullshit from anyone. i am so fucked up right now.😔 his rejection of me is almost impossible to bear. i told him that i couldn't imagine loving anyone else ever again. i don't know what to do.	1

is suicide a bad option? why? - i used to meditate but it just made me aware that i am drifting endlessly through life. - i go to work, waste my time there. i've been trying to do a routine for 3 years now, but my brain just won't let me do anything correctly before switching to the next new thing i'm excited by. i went to a therapist, he gave pills that made me feel sedated. it left me with no drive to do anything. stopped taking that shit because it used to make me feel constipated. i forget to exercise, sleep on time or even eat right because i get caught up in an activity for a time being and forget everything else. - my parents are constantly fighting so it sucks to be at home. - i have no employable skills. liberal arts major. - i don't know how to connect with people. i have no one to actually call a friend. i don't even connected to my parents. i mean ppl are nice and i appreciate their work and effort. but i don't feel the need to interact. so i'm just chilling here by myself. the pain of existence is real. how do i cope? just disappearing seems like a beautiful option right now. sigh😔 let me know your thoughts.	1
i have tea about my dumb life and i got rejected 🥺 so what had happened was- i have a crush on my best friend, gamers. i'm a mythical creature ((a girl)) and my bestfriend is a boy. i told him i had a crush. he told me to tell him. (i also have a small crush on one of our mutual friends yes i'm a whore) and i told him to guess and he got three hints and i answered them and i was gonna tell him i had a crush on him and he said "i don't want to say this... but is it ahww" (his initials, we have a running joke abt it) i said "who?" and he said "is it me?" and i said "i don't know anyone named me sorry" and then he got mad at me and i just said "no ofc it's not you" and then he keeps on guessing and he says our mutual friends name. i've already given up at this point and i just say "yes." life is sad and full of disappointment.	0

well, here we are again.so, i decided to go out tonight to one of my favorite bars. just to get out of the house and be around people, y'know. and get drunk, of course. i'm by myself, however. which i've done numerous times before and have been fine, but tonight i'm just feeling like a loser who doesn't have any friends. i'm kind of regretting coming out at all. sigh. i guess i'll just drink the loneliness and depression away. and hope the suicidal thoughts will be kept at bay. cheers 🍻	1

thinking my house was getting burgled. it was just last night at 1am so technically today but since it was a weekday and me being the nocturnal youngster i am, everyone was asleep except me. i woke up my dad thinking there were burglars in the house. the kitchen door went back and forth like crazy and there was no one downstairs, i was terrified because i had locked up everything securely half an hour prior to it and couldn't sleep in bed. so after getting him up we make the trek downstairs. we went full on the walking dead style with chisel and hammer in hand, not even joking. using army hand motions picked up from movies indicating the coast was clear we progressed, slowly but surely. inspected every door, every room and every table, heck, every cupboard too, anywhere someone could stay hidden but alas, no burglars found. there were extreme winds and somehow they must be gotten through a gap somewhere which we couldn't spot, it couldn't have been anything else. they got in somehow and messed with the doors and that was it. so we had to block them with chairs. i mean, i thought that burglars could use the winds to camouflage themselves making last night the perfect opportunity. it didn't help that every five minutes the opposite garden's light kept turning on suspiciously. but only now i just found out it was motion sensitive 😅. oh well, it's clear. at least i can sleep in peace now. tl;dr: if you think you're being burgled on a windy day. go to sleep.	0

i dont even want to be happythe thought that always just finds its way into my head is "i don't want to be happy even, i just know i want to die before im 30". i dont have anything. literally anything to live for. my main goal in life was to have a family, but i just don't think im ever going to have kids because generational trauma is real and i cant possibly imagine doing that to my kids. i thought i wanted to be a teacher, but im so tired and burnt out and thinking about it, i honestly don't think i can handle constantly being a good role model to kids all the time. i don't think ill ever date again because i just drag people down and i ruin the relationships in my life. my degree is useless and i don't enjoy anything. literally nothing makes me happy anymore. i used to love anime. cant motivate myself to watch any. dogs? used to research and dream of them. now? not really... my family? i am so extremely sad to say that i feel like i don't even feel like i love them... im literally shiveling up. i used to be strong and fit and whatever. and everything is gone. i just despise life. and it makes me sad because maybe i do care? but i don't??? and then life. what is the purpose of life anyways. so what if im happy? i just don't really care anymore about it. i might believe in heaven (please don't comment on religion thanks, id rather not have to deal with the ✨religion is a fairytale✨ stuff. respect beliefs even if you don't belive it, its not that hard), and it used to make me so hopeful about being happy forever. but honestly...whats the point. i'd rather just not. not exist. not be here. just nothing. id just rather have nothing, be nothing, exist nowhere. death is so comforting. just nothing. no afterlife, no suffering, no mundane, no existing. i have no motivation to go back onto my meds or do therapy. im losing motivation to graduate. im tired. im exhausted. and i just want to feel absolutely nothing.	1

getting pulled twice over by cops in less than 5 minutes let me preface this by mentioning i'm on a special road trip with my dad to go hiking in the blue ridge mountains after we both got fired. we have't really spent much time together in years so this is a really special opportunity to reconnect. we both love hiking and we haven't been to appalachia together since i was little. we are however on a really tight budget (unemployed) and can't spare a dime. so we left out this morning and we were going down a small state highway having a merry old time. out of nowhere there was a speed trap going down from 65 to 55 with 2 state troopers waiting. i got pulled and a ticket issued. that sucks big time but whatever, not going to let it ruin my trip. so to get back on the busy highway from the shoulder i had to accelerate really fast to get with the flow of traffic and i over compensated a little i guess?. and not even 30 seconds after, the motherfucking town sherriff runs me down and gives me another citation for reckless driving. despite my explaining the situation and showing him the other citation. now i have to appear in court for getting 2 citations so close together and pay a ton of money i don't have. completely ruined the mood for the weekend now we're just sitting here in aggravated silence. fuck that sherriff 🖕🖕😤😤🖕🖕 tl;dr : got dp'd by some next level speedtrap fuckery on a special trip with my dad.	0
thoughts on this phrasing? really need help my best friend that i kinda like is in a relationship. we were talking about stuff and she used the phrase "he's not cooler than you 😐 he just has a crush on me and you don't" do you think there's an underlying message there? or am i reading too far into it	0

paige okay so this happened on fb. i thought- okay she's calling herself fat, i can call her that too, i meant it as a joke, i even used laughing faces and shit, and as u can see even called her beautiful so i really didn't mean to be a dick. now that i look at it i see how she could have been insulted, but i honestly was just being a dumbass trying to be funny, and i've told piage to come crossfit with me before, so that's the reason i even said what i did. for real, as in "dude for real come to cross fit" not as in " for real you are fat" anyway i didn't even see her comment saying "this is why we aren't friends anymore" and later on in the day i invite her to my braai. she starts raging saying i'm a dick and whatever cause of my comment. so i tell her i was just joking, but say i'm sorry anyway, i can see how it could be seen as dick or whatever, and i ask her if i should delete it. she says don't bother. i try to reconcile and she starts being mean to me, so i say that now she is hurting my feelings, and she says she doesn't care.. now i'm thinking come on, you don't want your feelings hurt but dont care about hurting other peoples feelings. then she sent me this: "can honestly say i have no need for people like you in my life if you're going to treat me that way 😊.... i'm actually happy with how i look, and even if i'm not, it has fuck all to do with you. most disgusting comment. from a revolting human. 👌🏻🍭" so now i get a little pissed cause i honestly didnt mean to be a dick, i appologised anyway and i deleted my comment and she's calling me a disgusting human. i say something low key insulting about the way she's acting, and she says shes gonna block me, so i say "your loss" and she says some cocky shit and blocks me. so now i cant even reconcile with her cause im blocked. but like i really didnt mean to be a dick. shes obviously self conscious about her weight and i touched on a sensative topic so i mean id like to reconcile but fk i donno maybe one day	0
why is my mouth numb... welp, tifu - i had one of the highest sat scores in my school. still doesn't negate that i have my moments... this morning whilst half asleep i was brushing my teeth thoroughly but halfway through it felt and tasted weird. i immediately threw up and my mouth felt completely frozen. i look down and realized i had mistaken the tube of icy hot for toothpaste. this happened an hour ago. i can't stop salivating and i think my tongue is about to fall off... at least i can laugh at myself 🤷🏽‍♀️	0

good game, buddy. i don't know you, online friend, but i was touched you used such nice words online. i'm a 25 y.o playing an online shooter and didn't really have high hopes for "decent" commentary. you were nice and we chatted about different strategies and you even complemented some strategies i was working on.

to die, or not to die? that is the question. hello, to whoever may be reading this. so, as you can probably tell from my posting to this subreddit, i'm not feeling too well/stable atm 🤷‍♀️ kinda formulating a plan to take my own life tonight, although i'm not sure how yet. copious amounts of alcohol and pills will most likely be involved. just a little brief mental health background, i've been dealing with (treatment resistant) major depression/suicidal ideation and social anxiety for about three to four years now. to the point where it's crippling and debilitating. i've been in and out of the psych ward too many times to count. i feel like all the avenues of treatment have been exhausted. i'm tired, hopeless, and at the end of my rope. i don't know what else to do. and tbh, i'm not really sure what i hope to gain from posting here. whatever. i'll probably just end up deleting it anyway.	1

when i travel i don't only like visiting and discovering new places. i like to experience different airlines and other transportations i love traveling and since i have a lot of money and have plenty of time for it i go on travel sprees when ever i'd like. i've travelled to a lot of cities in the usa and a lot of different countries as well with many different airlines and other form of transportations. i try them all out just for the experience and if it's good then i do it again but if it's mediocre i stay away from it. i've never been on long train rides but a lot of my friends have and they tell me that it's fine but i can be tiresome so i decided to try it out for my self. i'm going from philadelphia to miami next month and instead of taking the plane i'm gonna take the amtrak train 🚂 just for the experience.	0

my life...i'm 20 years old and i've been low for a long time! it's about the member down there! i've measured my penis bone pressed and got it to 9cm flaccid and 13,5 erected! i feel like that is to small! i think of it every day! doing exercises like never before, searching how to make it bigger, but it doesn't follow! my biggest dream in life was to get a wife and kids! but i think that's no point dreaming... no girl wants that small of a penis it is really small and i feel its hard to find smaller on the internet. everyone is bigger! and since nothing works to make it bigger and you have no one to talk to about it (i don't have a dad) maybe it's time for me... time to end this miserable life... just wish i was normal.. wish things were different... why did i have to get this shit life? people that are complete shit gets everything.. can't even get a normal dick.. i'm not here for attention i've been her for a long time but nothing is changing i though maybe the exercise would help.... guess this is my goodbye 👋	1

tifu. suggesting to my boss german sausages had been dipped into his beer 🙊 so, a colleague had some german beer kegs in the office to celebrate. we all had already drunk one, when a superior showed up, grinning and asking where the offered german sausages where, although knowing fully well there only would be the beer, and a few, err, germans. i promptly replied: "we dipped them into this just a moment ago!(pointing at the beer glass he had grabbed)" everyone was laughing but then got silent and everyone felt a bit ashamed i think. oh gaaad. i'm probably get fired for this insubordination 😿	0

my boyfriend [26/m] of [8 months] doesn't want me [25/f] to dye my hair "crazy" colours i've always loved playing around with my hair and hair colours. and i've always liked "crazy" hair colours. i've had my hair blue, lavender, gray. i think they're super fun and when done right, look beautiful, cool, and unique. i currently sport a more normal hair colour, blonde, and honestly have no intention of doing a crazy colour any time soon. that's just not the look i'm into right now. my boyfriend... absolutely hates a lot of crazy colours. he does like lavender and silver, and could "deal" with some others. but some - he just hates. turquoise, bright purple, pink - he says he finds them absolutely horrendous. i tell him well, i actually like those hair colours, and if i wanted in the future, i'd still do it even if you hate it.. he says "well that means you don't care about my opinions/feelings. you know i hate it but you would still do it. you're not a compromising person. you would choose your hair over our relationship?" he says he would be embarrassed to go out with me. he compares it to how i would feel if he went and got a purple mullet. obviously taste is subjective. so it's fine that he hates it so much. that's just his taste. but i tried to tell him that, well, you shouldn't be embarrassed because the general public doesn't hate it as much as you do. tons of people love those hair colours! (i can't say the same about purple mullets). i show him instagram models with turquoise, pink hair. these girls have half a million followers. "see? look at all these people that like it!" him: "well those are instagram models! that's different." me: "so instagram models are above me? they can rock the colour but i can't? 🤔" he says he never sees anyone in real life with those colours. they're so few which means they're probably unattractive. well just because somebody doesn't have it doesn't mean they find it unattractive. 🤔 i would never get a tattoo but i still find them attractive. he says "just because people think it looks cool, doesn't mean they find it attractive" ... what does that even mean? why does it matter? why does he care so much about what people think? i'm not sure who's the one being uncompromising here. is it me? i mean, i don't absolutely have to have turquoise hair. there are other colours that he likes like lavender and silver. but i don't know.. it still feels restricting.. like i only have a short list to choose from. hair is temporary anyway. but he says "6 months? that's way too long" i mean, if i put myself in his shoes, i wouldn't like it if he wanted to shave his head. i would express my distaste. but if it made him feel himself, and happy, and he really wanted to do it.. i'm not sure if i go off on him "you don't care about my feelings!" maybe it was the way i said it.. maybe i came off a bit rude with my "well i'm still going to do it anyway no matter what you think" or is he uncompromising? should he just suck it up? let me have my bodily autonomy? support me if it makes me happy? be able to look past it and love everything else about me? it's just hair.. right? or maybe he just hates it thaaaatt much. i mean, if he insisted on getting a purple mullet for some reason... i probably would be less attracted to him.. i don't know. but i would respect that he's doing what makes him happy i think? idk, it's hard to say without being in the situation myself.. i don't mind not doing my hair turquoise.. i think? but i can't shake the feeling of feeling slightly controlled? .. he also gave me shit for wearing a crop top to a diner once.. said it's not appropriate in the winter time at a diner.. why not? 🤔 diners are casual restaurants.. i was wearing high waisted pants so my belly button wasn't even showing.. anyways, just not sure who is being unreasonable here. maybe both of us? maybe neither of us are handling it gently? maybe i got too defensive and maybe i'm supposed to sacrifice a bit for my partner? and maybe he cares way too much? tl;dr my boyfriend hates crazy hair colours. i like crazy hair colours so it makes me feel a bit restricted in my ability to express myself. should i compromise? is that how relationships work? or should he not care so much about my hair.	0

how do i feel my mum that i self harm and feel depressed? f14 i need help. i admit that i do. i've attempted suicide more than 10 times and yet no one knows. i still want to kill myself. i self harm every night and sometimes during the day and yet no one knows how bad it is and how bad it's getting. the only people that knew have left this world. i do online school and the only two friends i have go to the public school that i left. i left public school because of my anxiety. i've told them both that i self harm (through text because i couldn't see them at the time) it was really hard for me to even do that. they kind of changed the subject but they told me they were there for me. now we never talk about it. i have no idea how to open up to my parents. we aren't very close and i wish we were. i live with only my mum. no one else, my siblings are all older and live with their partners or children. my dad lives close to us and he sometimes comes to see me. he's already lost a sister to suicide and he has bipolar himself. i don't know how to tell them anything. i haven't hugged my mum is so long. i really just want to hug her, tell her how i feel and what's going on in my life. but i don't know how 😭i really want to commit suicide but i feel like if i do that my mum will think it's her fault. and i don't want to leave this world without hugging my mum, but i also don't want to see my parents die before me.	1

i turned into a crazy ex and feel so pathetici was losing my mind after i quit smoking. like i'm not the type of personality who likes to live with an increased risk of cancer. fuck... life isn't a joke. if your body gives out it's over. you have to eat extremely healthy, constantly work-out, make sure your body is in top shape. what did i do? fucking smoke all day!! everyday i would constantly smoke cigarettes and spliffs and my diet was just whatever. like no idea, just dicking around with hamburgers and other garbage. barely any fruits and vegetables. just destroying my body. now when i'm older i feel so fucked up about it. i constantly go to the gym, eat healthy, sleep well, quit smoking and trying to save my life. i'm 28, quit almost one year ago smoking like 5 spliffs (tobacco + weed in a joint) per day and cigarettes too. i think i'll get cancer because of smoking someday. ahhhh :( now i'm just a normal healthy person who tries to keep his body as healthy as possible. but it's fucking scary because i didn't do this for like 8 or 9 years at all. it's such a fucking huge contrast... it feels like such a different person who did that. so naturally: i lose my mind. i talk with everyone about this. everyone encourages me to keep going. i go with my friend to the gym everyday. i eat so much healthy food! like i'm just manically trying to get better. gain weight and become so much healthier. i also want to talk with my ex for some reason. i'm not thinking this through and let her know how hopeless i feel. she was so helpful in the past and i'm like i need to talk with her. but i'm so dumb because i get completely carried away when she finally replies. i finally have her attention and want her to listen what i'm going through. she blocks me though and something goes haywire in my brain and i keep making new accounts (it takes like 3 seconds on instagram). i keep talking about my problems and she keeps saying something i want to reply to and then blocks me. i walk right into a trap. oversharing my problems with her and then she feels overwhelmed and insults me so heavily. like fuck... so heartbreaking what she said. makes me even feel worse. i really don't understand why i did this. being so fucking annoying with making new accounts. she engaged a bit so everytime she blocks me and i want to reply to what she says. i didn't even think about what i was doing was strange. ugh wtf why did i do this 😓 after that i keep begging her for months to talk because it's like... just give me some validation :( you can't insult me so badly that my whole spirit is broken and then not talk to me ever again. so then i get stuck in this compulsive rut of sending her messages on instagram dm and then think: nah, this doesn't work and delete them again. then write them again because living with those insults repeating in my head hurts too much too. i wrote so much shit and then deleted it again. i just kept thinking of things to say why it's fucked up why she treats me like this. broke up for her. she didn't even let me explain how i was living incredibly healthy now and that i'm trying so hard to save my life. if she'd just call and let me make amends i'd feel so much better. but after months of trying and embarrassing myself i gave up. she doesn't want to talk at all and now i've spammed her so much in vain that i'm even more fucked up because i turned into a stalker. like crazy ex to the max. my emotions are calmed down a bit after like 6 months, but i feel so utterly embarrassed for my pathetic behavior. like if your ex clearly indicates she's not the right person to talk about this then why did i keep going? it's so strange that i did that. i also kept trying to explain it after she wrote her insanely cruel last message, but it's just such weird behavior of me. then i harassed her for months to talk it out because her insults ruined me so much that i walked around as a zombie. feel so destroyed by this situation. like i'm such an idiot to end up in this position. i wish she had saved me with a 'i will never reply again' and i would have gotten the message. i guess i kept making new accounts because i wanted her to understand me? like humans like to be understood by people they care about so i wanted to tell her about my extreme existential crisis i'm going through and she just keeps dismissing me and even saying she doesn't fucking care if i die and so much harmful other stuff in the end. that made my problems even worse. i felt even smaller and felt like i don't deserve to live. i felt completely broken by her insults and often slept for way too long to escape having to face another day with her words hating on me constantly repeating in my head. fuck. so hard to make a comeback after acting like this. what's wrong with me??? why am i such a strange idiot?? :( fuck, fuck, fuck :(	1

not sure what to name this.. things are just happening so fast kinda weight post but here it goes. it has been about 4 months since i have decided to join the marines. i'm that amount of time i have done so much to be eligible. my life in general feels like it has been going on the fast setting. just right now i realized this. let's starts with the most "shocking" thing. when i was little i used to be very obese. not sure if anyone reading this can relate to this but, when i jumped, everything jiggled. when i ran, i was out of breath, every second i used to look forward to eating. yet when i looked in the mirror i was disgusted. i have spent the years between 8th grade and 12th grade wanting to lose weight and struggling to keep it off. now, well, it all happened so fast. 4 months ago i was "skinny fat" i remember how i still had "man boobs" and everything was bouncy. a few minutes ago i woke up from a nap and you know how when you're asleep you do dumb shit? (well i do.. i have some stories lmao) ok so i woke up touching my self (not like that 😐) i sleep without a shirt and like i was passing my hand over my chest and i remember how it was bouncy and shit but now it's firm. arms too, back etc. i guess what i'm sayin is, i spend so many years trying to lose weight and having setbacks so often but now i'm just 4 month im in a better shape than i've ever been in. i never imagined i'd be here and to me it's shocking how i transformed my body from being jiggly to having muscles left and right in such a small amount of time. throughout all of this i have changed my name too. this is a huge accomplishment in 2 ways. i have had sever selective mutism and social anxiety for years and for me to go into a count room and explain my reasons, go to every government building and request my files changed is freakin huge. i mean like throughout all of this i, 1. got a mind of myself and went with it(changed my name against my parents wishes) 2. talked to so many people 3. i was clueless on how and what to change but i went out of my way to figure out without someone holding my hand. i have always hated my birth name and i guess now i officially say, "i love my name" without being ashamed to tell people what it was when they asked. here a big one too. i woke up and i was like "lol.." "you can do pull ups" "whaaaaat" lmao because it's like a reality check. the last thing i needed to be eligible to join the marines is to be able to do pull ups. i started wanting to join by not even being able to pick up a 20lb dumbbell. i can do 15 pull ups now like wtf? that's amazing. i'm terrified of what i'm going to go through in boot camp. i honestly am. like i mentioned, i suffered from social anxiety and selective mutism and i'm going to be 100% out of my comfort zone. sure i'm terrified but i'm also really excited. i have wanted this for so long and it's finally within reach. it's like being in that pitch black tunnel for decades and finally being able to see that light at the end of the tunnel. it's all been happening so fast i haven't really had time to process it all. i have achieved so much but i have a long way to go though and i intend on getting there.	0

thoughts on dreadlocks ? for context on myself, i'm a swashbuckling pirate from australia. dreads are easy for me being on the ocean and not having hair dresser access for long periods of time. i'm curious about people's thoughts about dreads, a lot of my friends don't really like em, some really do, i think there's a lot of misconceptions and people who think only certain cultures are allowed to have them (i only have respect for these cultures). any y'all got any thoughts? people try to sell me a lot more drugs since i got them 😫.	0

helping my dad put the cover on our boat hoist my boyfriend and i are in okoboji, one of iowa's great lakes, visiting my dad and helping him get stuff ready for the summer. we have a dock on the canal with a boat hoist. usually all summer we keep the boat out but the rest of the year it's inside my dads garage. so we take the boat down to the lake, put in the water, and drive it the dock. the hoist stays in year around - the part out of the water that "houses" the boat is a metal frame with poles going across the top. a canvas cover goes on top of that. we only put the canvas cover out in the summer. putting the cover on is pretty easy - the hard part is securing it. there are holes in the top of the metal bars across the top that line up with holes in the cover along the bottom. you secure it with a metal spring with two hooks on either end - one end goes into the pole, the other in the tarp. the metal part extends over the edges of the boat so you have to lean over the side of the boat to put in the springs. i'm on the dock side of the boat trying to secure it. you really have to pull down hard on the spring to get it to reach the hole in the cover. i was really struggling with it and it slipped out of my hand and i almost went overboard. no big, i'll keep trying. i put all my weight into pulling the spring. next thing i know i'm losing my balance and fall out of the boat. i faceplant the dock with my legs still in the air before sliding into the canal. i hit my head so hard i saw stars. luckily my boyfriend was close enough to pull me out - not that it's super deep but i was a little delirious. my lens fell out of my glasses from smacking my head on the dock, i have a minor black eye, a goose egg next to my eye, and a nice red scrape about the size of a pack of smokes. my shoulder is also all scrapped up, as is part of my arm. the worst is my bum - it scraped the boat and the dock on my way down - i've got a nice patch of "road rash" and a fist sized bruise. the worst part? my grandpa's funeral is thursday (today is sunday). i'm singing and giving the eulogy and i look like i got in a bar fight. yaaaay. 🙄	0

i suffer from severe anxiety/ depression/ ocd and it's almost 4 am here. i'm lying in bed with my husband and our doggos but i can't stop crying.i thought coming to this sub would make me feel better? boy was i wrong. reading all of your stories of how "perfect" life is and how you're still miserable makes it so hard for me to be optimistic about life as a 22m homosexual. my life has never been good, not even okay. i thought dogs and marriage and a house could fix it but it was just a brief glimpse of something reminiscent of happiness? life really fucking sucks and i just want to go to bed. my nervous ticks that i haven't had since grade school are resurfacing. oh and the cherry on top is that when i cry i feel guilty that my husband might hear me so i feel worse and the cycle continues and worsens 😎	1
me. everyday i wake up, get ready, go to school, come home, eat sleep and repeat. i experience huge amounts of stress, no matter how much i study i cannot achieved what is needed for my program. i don't even want to become a nurse anymore. i thought i could help people but i'm not cut out for the job especially when i can't get through my pre reqs. i have a loving boyfriend. he is my world, he helps me stay the person i am deep down. he's the reason i made it through high school and am where i am right now. i helped him too, we compliment each other. i love him dearly and i know he loves me. this is why it's so hard for me to go. i have dreams, goals and aspirations i want to achieve, with him by my side. but i'm not going anywhere. i have a loving mom and dad; my brothers drive me crazy but they mean so much to me. i don't come from a broken home. so how come i am so lost? i feel broken. i don't trust in people anymore, for everyone i have has let me down in ways i wouldn't have ever thought possible. betrayed trust is a recipe for disaster.. there's no going back. i lost a bit of myself each time it happened. i severely struggle with it. there's not a day that goes by where i don't think about all the people who have done terrible things to me. the truth is i can't get over it because i will never be the same person anymore. i will never have a best friend that i will 100% trust. i will never feel comfortable with them around my love, and when they are around other people. i cannot trust anymore. i am scared of heartbreak, i am scared of losing the people i love. i never want to feel that alone ever again. but i really am that alone even if it's not the first thing on my mind anymore. i have no friends because everyone hates me. people say "nobody hates you, you're liked..." blah blah blah. then why was there a group of girls whose mission was to make my life miserable in school, during sports, online, and at work. i'm still angry at them. they made me lonely, they made me miserable and most significantly, they made me really sad. sad to the point where i often stay up crying for hours silently so nobody hears me. i cry because it hurts. i cry because i have no one. i don't have people in my life who i can invite to things or who invite me. i'm almost always alone. i don't fit in with what's cool. i hate drugs, alcohol and parties. social situations make me shake, confrontation makes me shake. this is all because of the last year and a half. i never used to be this version of me. the first time i experienced an anxiety attack, i thought i would be alone at grad. i couldn't reach my boyfriend, and i cried all of my bio class in the washroom. all i wanted was to not feel so alone for once, i wanted to go with him and not have the manipulative malicious girls take the one person who made me feel okay, away from me. i couldn't stop shaking and i honestly kept wishing i hope i'd just disappear. i almost committed suicide a few weeks after. my boyfriend actually found the message on my phone. in that instant i almost felt like i didn't exist. i was washed over and my emotion had gone. then it came back only i felt guilty. i broke my bf, i made him cry. that was one of the worst feelings i've ever felt. i thought he would just move on quickly and i still think he would be okay to this day. but that's something i've forced myself to believe because he too is sick. i could not live without him, so how could i leave him in this state?! right now, the urges come and go. they freak me out sometimes, i feel like i almost wanna jump in front of a bus or a train sometimes when i'm standing right there. but i can't because i now understand the pain if leave behind. i just want to feel the way i did a year and a half ago. i want to be me! is that too much to ask for? i'm sorry if i cannot make it, just know i've always tried. i've always tried my best to make you feel extra special as mine. please tell my family i loved them❤️ they were always my home and my safe spot. so just in case... i love you babe! thank you for always being mine ❤️ you were understanding when i was upset, you treated me well. you made me the happiest girl ever when we hung out. i wish i could always feel like that. my favorite days were full of kisses, cuddles and chicken tenders. thank you for being you.. you are my world! you stuck by me through thick and thin. you deserve so much happiness and love. i tried to give you everything i could. please don't forget about me and all the memories we made. i will watch over you, just please hang on. i love you handsome❤️ you're my sweet pie :)	1

genuinely debating creating an anon gmail and sending this to my school... so there's a kid at my school, and i recently (a couple months ago) found his profile on tik tok. and to say the least, it's bad. racist, homophobic, just plain gross. we're in 9th grade, is it gonna matter if i send these screenshots and recordings to my principal? is it worth doing? i'm debating :0 "data" i've collected: 🙈 [yikes](<url>)	0
causing a massive fight in paintball buckle up guys! this is a long one but sooo worth it. heres a bit of context, i was a part of this after school club that organized a paintball trip for the first time in decades! the amount of participants in the trip was a lil over 20 and the majority of them happen to be friends of mine. fast-forward to the paintball arena, each person is assigned to one of two teams. me & sam (a friend of mine) happen to be on opposing teams so we trash talk about how were gonna take each other down and enter the arena pumped up. they explain to us in there that each member has a tag wrapped around their arm. the color of the tag corresponds to the color of their teammates tags. problem is, the place was too dark to see the colors. they also tell us to yell "freeze!" to anyone within a 2m radius as a safety rule. game starts and all hell breaks loose, people are throwing grenades and shooting aimlessly but not me. im on a mission to take down sam since i know hes gunning for me. i manage to sneak behind enemy lines and get a few kills. then...it happened... this 7ft arab dude catches me off guard and whispers "so whats the plan?" right in my ear. i jump in the air and do a 180 degree turn followed by "freeze!" but he was confused. he said "what are you doing?", i was still panicking since my instincts took over so...i shot him....5 fucking times. he yells "what the fuck is wrong with you?!", so the referee escorts him off the arena and the game continues. i didnt really think much of it until it was time to leave. we all wait outside for the bus and thats when the arab dude rushes towards sam and shoves him into the wall. he doesnt even give sam room to ask whats going on before swinging a punch. i get in between the two of them since i was the biggest guy in the group (humble brag) and push them both away. thats when the arab dude yells "how can you be such a bitch and shoot your own fucking teammates?!". thats when it hits me, there are only two black guys in the group. me & sam. this arab dude must have mistaken me for sam when i crossed into their area since the gear covered our faces amd all you could see was our afros. they were both given a warning by the club leader which defused the fight. i took the secret with me to my grave. to this day sam is confused as to why that guy attacked him 😂 tl;dr: unintentionally instigated a fight between two people.	0

there's actually a positive side to being lonely i used to think it was pretty shit being alone. no one to communicate with, no one to share life with, no one to experience new things with and just generally no one to talk to. it gets boring. but i've realised actually it's more of a positive. there's no one to impact. i see people who have tight families, have loving partners and great friends but they battle their demons everyday and this can cause either pain and hurt for those they are close to or they will suppress their feelings for fear of hurting those loved ones. but for me? i can break down in a pile of shit whenever i want and i'm not hurting anyone. i can do irrational things and exhibit erratic behaviour and there's no one to question me and my decisions. most importantly i can get in to the mood and decide that it's time, which leads me to.... i can die without hurting anyone. people with tight families, loving partners and great friends will leave behind a path of pain when they pass away. these are generally people who can be considered contributors to life and other people; these are people who have left an impact in the hearts and minds of fellow human beings and so their absence takes away a piece of those hearts and leaves in place only a void that can not be filled. but me? when i die i take no pieces of heart with me. i do not cause pain on my way out. i die as i lived: silently and unnoticed. and while i am a non-contributor in life in the negative sense i am actually doing more of a positive recompense in death by not hurting anyone. so while i live alone, dying alone is more important. giddy up 🤙	1

i'm just about ready to off myself i have depression, anxiety, i've had them since i was six and i'm now thirteen, i've dropped out of school, have no education, don't even work towards my goals, don't look after my poor doggy properly, cause my parents problems, piss off my friends and to add to that, i've suffered with constant severe constipation my entire life and i don't want to do this shit anymore. i don't want to go through another agonising five-hour fortnightly trip to the toilet or sort out my sleeping schedule which fucks up no matter what i do, or disappoint and annoy anyone anymore, or face up to the fact that i'm an inevitable mistake of the universe and end up living only to be a hole for my parents' money to fall into. my poor, poor best friend is just having to deal with my shit constantly and he's understandably getting distant and spending his time with other people instead of me, my parents are constantly worrying about my future and my dad doesn't know when to stop reminding me that i'm turning into a fucking trainwreck. i'm so done. i want to give everybody a break from me - no more worrying about my wellbeing or my future, no more depressing fucking texts from me at 3am, no more expensive trips to the doctor for an issue that'll never resolve itself, no more of me. my family and friends would benefit in every way from my permanent absence. i just want to leave. i'm 👌 this fucking close to just throwing myself out the window. i fucking hate me.	1

i accidentally came out to two of my friends this week it's both hilarious and so very embarrassing. basically: i dropped my phone last week and the screen is messed up. so when you tap on one area, it sometimes spazzes and brings up something totally different. i'm a 21 year old guy. it's not really a secret that dudes sometimes use their phone to watch porn - but usually they delete their history afterwards, which i did not. you can guess how i accidentally came out to two of my buds: wanted to show them something on safari, stupid screen mucks up and brings out my history for all to see. i don't think i've ever turned that dark a shade of red 😅	0

hormones possibly making me into a cunt 🤔 hi, i'm currently taking birth control pills. i haven't really kept up with them because i'm irresponsible. now before someone gets their panties in a bunch, my birth control is strictly to help with painful cramps. not for baby making so blah. i use to have an implant but my body hardcore rejected it. then i got switched to pills due to painful cramping. anyways, i use to be a really nice and patient person (i know that's hard to believe) but now i have the temper of a ticking time bomb. things upset me so easily now. i almost threw my phone against the wall out of frustration today. got into a petty argument with a receptionist. usually, i would let rude remarks go but my claws came out and i was ready to rip her a new one. my overwhelming frustration builds up for no reason sometime. anyone else have this problem? should i look into a new birth control? i was thinking the shot but now i'm considering opting out of any form. i'm not happy with the mean little nugget i've become.	0
i wanted to kill myself today but i couldn't carry through it this week has been the most painful in my entire life. i never felt so much pain and despair and confusion as much as i have in this holiday week. i had a perfect plan. the materials i needed. the perfect location. one thing was missing. it was the same thing that i lacked that drove me to want me to kill myself in the first place and that was courage. i have so many overwhelming reasons to end my life but the thought of those left behind ate me up in the most tortuous kind of way. i still want to die i feel nothing but powerlessness and despair most of the days but i just cant i fucking cant. suicide is horrible no matter how attractive it seems it doesnt change the fact that its horrible. to anyone struggling today im with you and i completely understand lets just hope we make it through ❤️	1

unrequited love suicide i have loved her for ten years. she loves me but isn't in love with me 🙄. i'm so hurt and in pain yet she is out on dates and fucking other guys. i have been told to accept it or leave. would killing myself cause her to feel as much pain as i am experiencing? i'm tired of the pain and hurt. she doesn't care. i'm just her friend. she looks right through me. i wanna die...	1
space waffles :d during break [at school] i was chilling with this new girl i met in chemistry class then my friend pushed the girl out of her way and ask if i wanted to try this waffles, i said no because i don't like waffles but she was being pushy and begged me to try them. i knew there was something up and so i asked her if she had put something in them, she nodded her head like those big headed toys plus her pupils were huge asf. and out of curiosity...i tried at least two of them and well, nothing happened. she said that it will take it's time and i've been waiting for it for about two periods [lessons]. until math [second last period], during the lesson everything was slow motion, the teacher wore this white shirt and the walls were also white so it looked like his head was floating which made me laugh maniacally. even the numbers on the board kept on moving then at biology, i noticed my friend was starring at the wall and apparently she was standing there for ten minutes, i think she had more than two.... we basically just sat there starring at board while the sir was explaining, my friend kept on complaining that she was hungry while i was in my own zone trying to understand why the board created a void filled with creatures. sorry my english sucks, ik, i'm still learning +(^v^)+ this happened last year and i'm planning getting stoned after the exams. ✨🌈👁️👄👁️	0

hello people, i lowkey have some issues in my life just felt like sharing. its a bunch of text. comment if you feel like it. so my little brother is sorta going crazy but he has a healthy lifestyle and he seems to channel his energy just fine until he sorta gets remotely confronted by the parents. he's doing good in school but i'm worried if he loses friends he will hate himself, cus that's how i would feel even though i don't know exactly why. we are sorta distant lately, i think his reason for not being super close to me is that we're not totally brushing all those years where i abused him under the rug. i was really violent n shit. i guess that doesn't go away, and i know in some ways i bring out a really vulnerable side of him. i think he loves himself so that's important. people seem to really love his god complex #2019. my little sister is also happy, but it seems like she's going crazy. she's already rebelling against mom but it feels like she doesn't know how to express what she wants and why. it's this whole process of realizing that just because mom is our mom, doesn't mean she can treat us like idiots for the rest of our lives. she's entering that process where she realizes mom isn't allowed to control her all the time, and is simultaneously realizing mom isn't that great a role model. instead of having developed complexes about herself due to having a relationship with mom, which i guarantee is the case with all her other kids, she has embodied mom's complexities, but only the superficial ones. most of mom's complexes are rooted in her own self-hatred and depression, so thankfully my little sister hasn't adopted those yes. but i feel like if in the future she does get depressed, she will act juvenile, defensive and detestable like mom is because of depression. i really hope she'll be okay. i feel like her future and her personality is already within her own hands. she's grown up really fast in a lot of ways. i don't love it when she talks a lot. more on the complexities thing, she is a hardcore perfectionist with her art, like mom. her art is also kinda shallow and all she focuses on is the superficial details, so already her artistic future is stunted by mom's absolutely shitty artistic process and demands on herself and my little sister. i don't know if i'm allowed to criticize how she treats my little sister considering how much time she spends listening to her and being with her and at times taking care of her. but it still feels like she doesn't support her, she doesn't inspire her. her perfectionism doesn't allow her to love my little sister because my little sister isn't perfect. i think this must bother my little sister a lot sometimes, but eventually she will break free and decide permanently that she doesn't have to be mom's little girl. my parents and their parenting. is questionable. to say the least. i realized talking with tita and abuelito that they don't have any advice from outside sources and they are pretty much doing things on their own. it's not very effective and at present time i don't have relationships where i want to talk to mom for very long. our parents are there for us to depend on them, but they never taught us how to depend on ourselves, which causes some complicated for everybody at home, because everybody has things they want to deal with on their own. i remember very few times where my parents encouraged me to grow, or change, or become a better person, or become a certain kind of person. it really shocked me to hear my dad say that shaping the way we turn out wasn't his responsibility. people figure that out on their own. i'm resentful towards them because so many issues i'm encountering now with people at school i'm learning how to deal with for the first time. i feel like there's something good in my values because the person i'm becoming is somebody i want to be and i'm happy when my friends tell me i've changed for the better. i think i don't restrict my role models to just being my parents, i feel like most of my high school life, from 9th grade onwards and especially after 10th grade, starting with my main g, was when i started learning things from my friends. it's sort of become a passion to get to know people and learn from them. i think this is how my passion sort of translated into acting. my parents however, where the source of lots of behavior i wanted to filter out of my life. being rude, mean, entitled, and above all acting without caring about how other people will react, are all things i feel like i learned from my parents. i remember being told a lot by friends, teachers, that i had to think before i speak. which meant i was never being considerate of other people. i know that this sort of narcissistic behavior where i am the only person that matters in a conversation is what i learnt from my parents, and it's something i'm happy to grow out of, which ultimately feels like a lot of growth, a lot of effort, and relatively a much larger amount of selflessness, even though it shouldn't be a massive task to not be narcissistic. it's becoming easier but that transition out is still in progress. i'm so happy i built relationships that aren't all bad. i hope this change sticks. there's still this voice of temptation in the back of my head that sometimes tells me to be selfish or do something rude because i am angry or i completely disregard the other person's emotions. these are momentary lapses and i'm still in this process of controlling my narcissistic personality when i am in tense or emotional situations. this is not hard to do when i consider how much less i end up hurting others. i'm okay. i'm happy. for the most part, i still feel like there's areas to grow. at the moments i'm lowkey in love with this cute argentinian guy. he's a nice guy and he's always ready to talk and he makes things funnier and he doesn't get tired of me and he sort of agrees with all the stupid shit i do and say. he is probably not good for me, because he brings out my completely inconsiderate side. i guess he is like that too in some ways. we sort of both had this recent change from bad to good, so i guess psychologically there are some similarities. it's implicit but he cares about me. toxic masculinity gets in the way i guess. i'm going to be sad to lose him. i like his taste in music. maybe a little too much. dad is still living that life where everything is in a pressure cooker. i think he ultimately wants what is best for everyone so if you just explain and ask what it is you need then he will listen. the problem is he doesn't know the difference between what people need, and what people want. he always says yes to the things you want. he's attracting women who even if they don't mean to take advantage of his complacent nature, do so. i think i'll talk to him about that. i hope he's happy. i think his relationship is healthy because it's making him happy enough for him to want others to be happy, which is all we all need at the end of the day. i guess that's why deep down he is still a good guy. i feel like we're about to see a version of dadinlove©️ which could be for the best. mom will lose her shit. mom losing her shit, walking on ice. the healthies thing for her is to do is... i don't know. she has a boyfriend but i don't think it will last. i highly doubt she is her true self with him. the problem with people like mom is that there's a dark side that people should know about. she is i'm almost sure a narcissist. she's also depressed. i can very much relate with the issues she is having. the narcissism. i really hope i learn and grow for good. maybe i won't, and i'll snap one day. i lowkey hope i develop schizophrenia. i think bi-polar disorder. there's just this fine line between loving and hating myself. and that's because the version of me i hate is still there, and i don't know if it will go away. i want to change and be this better version. the best version. ultimately, most of what i'm changing is how i act around people. the things that don't feel genuine: like being supportive, being caring, affectionate, i sort of fake. that's a scary thought. i don't think i'm suited for a relationship. unless somebody can accept that those things aren't in my dna. it just feels like i haven't had those things in my life for so long. i'm still really awkward with physical affection. i still feel that affection from my mom when i was a kid, but there's something conflicting about it. like i don't know if there's really emotion there. nowadays it's just a kiss mom gives me on the cheek. completely empty. i don't feel anything towards it, except lowkey disgust because i don't know why she does it. i know it makes her happy. it's complicated. my older brother is doing... i don't know him well enough, but i also know that he is battling narcissistic personality disorder. i need to have faith in change. my older brother is a success story with some clear flaws. most of his solution hinges on weed. he still can't control his emotions. he still snaps. he still doesn't care sometimes. i'm sure his girlfriend is used to that, i'm happy he found someone who is. i assume he deals with it the same why i make my close ginger friend deal with it, which is by apologizing and hopefully learning because you don't want to hurt the people you care about. i feel like love is maybe the key to getting out of this thing. i'm going to let that apply to everyone. i'm still an asshole sometimes, pretty often. i still see my older brother snap sometimes, but he's a very good human being, so there's some hope there. i guess a lot of his personality is him compensating for being an asshole, which is respectable. and healthy. props to him. my eldest brother is going to drive himself crazy, i think. i believe he hasn't grown enough as a person, but have we ever. i feel like he will be stuck an adolescent until the world either brutally tells him he can't be one, or until something clicks in his brain. i think it's not even an issue. it's just. i don't know. my eldest brother is such a different person. he has really become his own person. in a lot of ways, he is super individual from the family. the issues are somewhat still the same, but its forgivable because he is a very sweet guy. i think his girlfriend might be disappointed in the long run if what she is thinking about is a boyfriend for life. there's that added social pressure that must be absolutely fucking with her. i need to talk to my eldest brother, and my older sister. my smallest brother is happy and already a good boy, which is a strange thing to say, i woulnd't expect me to say that. but he puts his toys away, says thank you, is sweet. he's very innocent, but he is learning a lot. he is already making progress at age two, growing, learning how to be patient, learning how to eat foods he doesn't love. love him. my step mom is also doing good. i wish things were a bit simpler there because to be honest i don't know how to feel about her. she's very nice and sweet so at the end of the day that matters the most. i'm pretty happy with who i am right now, which is a new feeling, and it's still not constant. i'm scared that when i go to uni i will be the version of myself that i hate and that others hate. i want to make friends and have fun and not get into drugs or gangs. i just want a loving, nice group of friends. i feel like after high school i will never get that again. there're so many people to trust here, it's so easy to branch out and talk to whoever. i like my life a lot, but only because of the friends in it. julian is a confusing guy, i love him but i wish he had a little more time for me. i'm worried about his relationship. i'm also worried that if things start to crumble he won't have anyone to depend on. i lowkey want to be the guy there to take care of him if it doesn't go down well, in part because i want him to know i'm there. maybe it's just twisted. i don't know. i had a wet dream last night. i don't know about who, but i wish i did because i feel like my own conscious screwed me over. like how could that happen without my consent? feeling violated. i hate cum, its gross and i don't like cleaning up. guys are a pain. low key wish this cute argentinian guy was bi is what i feel like saying now. i don't know why, i guess what i want is a relationship with a guy to see what it's like. i want to experiments, with relationships girl or guy, but sexually. not necessarily because i'm horny but because i'm anxious to learn and interact on that level. it's a whole different world waiting to be explored. i feel like my narcissism might interfere with the sexual side of my life is i don't learn how to deal with it before leaving uni. maybe i should ask my colombian about it. her girlfriend said very nice things about how my colombian friend treats her when it comes to sexual stuff. i love em. low key want a threesome with em. but again, i don't know if it's to say i had a threesome or because i want to try the sexual experience. although to be honest with myself i don't need 2 girls to have an amazing experience. i definitely wouldn't be bored with just one girl. why did i just write 2400 words just thinking out loud. do i need people to know these things? i guess so. i want somebody to hear these things. i want to say these things, but i don't know if i care what people have to say about them. i guess that's when i decided to post on r/self. if you guys have something to comment on, especially with relation to narcissistic personality disorder (npd, diagnosed my parents myself, nothing legit, lowkey unsure if i have the narcissistic trait as well), please share.	0

by not planning for tomorrows road trip so this fuck up hasn't happened yet but it starts tomorrow. sorry about the formatting 😬 heres the situation: recently my girlfriend left me and iv been trying my best to move forward(not going well). i just got a car after not having one for over a year and have been driving and listening to music pretty much anytime im not working or visiting friends. so anyways i found a couple new bands and saw they were on tour together and the closest they'd be is in brooklyn(about 6 hours away from me). i got the tickets, took time off work and figured i would drive down and spend 2 nights in my car since i definitely cant afford a hotel or anything. iv only been to nyc once, never really drove in a city that big and have no idea how to find a free or cheap place to park near the bar ill be at or what the hell other problems im going to run into. tl ; dr driving 6 hours tomorrow to sleep in my car in brooklyn for 2 days for a concert, haven't really planned at all, never driven in a city that big, and im going alone. pretty sure this is going to be a nightmare so any tips or assistance would be great!	0
not now, but i know i will do it one day.for years, since 6th grade i have just had horrible mental health. years and years later i still feel like shit. i have dealt with bullying, and mentally abusive relationships. i almost killed myself, had a plan, a note and everything. i have been doing really well recently, i have been happy with friends, but constantly in the back of my mind, i just think about killing myself. i can't look in the mirror without crying, i hate my looks, my personality, my intelligence. i told my parents about how i wrote a suicide note back in grade 9 but they just called me attention seeking (they both work in mental health so i thought they might actually help... but no). i don't plan on killing myself anytime soon, but i am so mentally weak, i don't even know how to describe it, my chest just feels heavy, and i feel worthless. the littlest things set me off, make me feel like suicide is the answer (and i mean the littlest like an argument). at this point i dont even care for my life, i started abusing shrooms in grade 10 because it gave me a good high, followed up by coke. i was sexually abused by my brother when i was 3 to when i was 6. he is ten years older than me. granted, he is much nicer now and acts like a good brother but i still have flashbacks and nightmares. my parents don't know, they favour him, and would never believe me. i harmed myself for over 5 years, i have lost so much blood i almost passed out. i stopped thankfully ❤️ i can't help but feel like everyone secretly hates me. i feel like such a burden to everyone. i seriously don't plan on killing myself soon or even want to, but i have been so mentally weak for so long. i just know that the second something bad (such as the death of my dog, a friend, another assault, etc) i will just end up killing myself. sorry this is all over the place even if anyone cares to reads this:/	1
hey guys, i'm 1 today! 🎂 hi, reddit! i've been a long time lurk, and finally made myself an account with only a few posts to my name, nothing special. recently i have become more active, replying to things, posting personal stories, actually upvoting things that make my day, etc. so, when today rolled around and i saw that it was my cake day, i got super excited and wanted to celebrate with my fellow redditors! thanks to reddit, i know how to be a functioning and financially stable adult, i see the beauty of our planet and the creatures that inhabit it, i get inspiration to create art or do that diy project that's been waiting to get done for ages. i get motivated to be healthier by people sharing their stories of fitness and their progress pics, i get to laugh on those days i really need it, and fully enjoy people's personal stories and confessions (it's so great to know i'm not the weirdest person on the planet). and as of today thanks to reddit, i now know that people cut their shits with inappropriate household objects to make them flush. thank you, reddit! i'm excited for our future adventures and i'll try to make a post here and there more often and not just lurk like a lurker! happy cake day to all those reddit babies out there celebrating with me today! 🎂	0

due to a typo by our it department, everyone has suddenly started calling our coworker a different name and i feel like i'm living in the twilight zone lol..so.. this man named greg who works down in the warehouse decided one day that "his email was broken" and asked it to issue him a new email address. turns out they made a typo and now his email address is grey@******.com. without hesitation, every. single. person. at the company began calling him grey. people that have worked with this man for *10 years*. it's so weird lol and no one will acknowledge it!! i even asked him to be sure since everyone was calling him grey and he assured me his name is gregory. 😂 😭 i just needed to put this out there in the universe because i feel like i'm taking crazy pills everytime someone calls him grey.	0

[m17] issues with [f16] friend tl;dr met a girl, mutual attraction she's busy though i miss talking to her need support/advice after my last relationship ended i started to try to friends and i made a friend [f16] who shares similar interests and we hit it off really well, we'd talk a lot but it was an on off thing, she's really busy with ice skating and school stuff, she wants to be an olympic skater so we talk when there's time. it was enough for me to be happy with. we have a very similar sense of humor which led to the greatest conversations i've ever had with someone, naturally this led to attraction from both sides. i was still a bit hung by my ex at this time. so i thought *shit i can't get involved with her, it'll just end up being a rebound* so i kept us as friends. i was looking for a cuddle buddy at the time because i'm moving to florida sometime next year for school but i liked this girl a lot and wanted more than just a cuddle buddy. i was having a surgery on my tailbone shortly after so i wanted someone to hang out at my house afterwards and i must've went through 10+ girls but i still couldn't get close enough to any of them to comfortably ask them to hang out at my house for a bit, but the surgery wasn't too bad and i felt alright afterwards. while i did this though i fell out of touch with [f16] for about a month. after a few days of recovery [f16] liked one of my pictures so i told her how i was doing and what was up. i told her i wanted to invite someone to my house after but i couldn't find anyone, she replied "i feel hurt you didn't invite me" i told her i basically just slept afterwards so it wouldn't have been fun anyway and told her we could go out together after i healed but she said "but you hate me" i was confused so i told her that i didn't and what made her think that, it was just a misunderstanding with a previous text. she was happy that i didn't hate her and she said she thinks i'm great but she's always busy and she'll try harder to talk to me. we talked a lot from there, it was mostly just get to know you stuff and at this point i was ready to move on from my breakup so i ramped up the flirting a bit and all seemed well. i was sitting in bed one time around 11pm feeling extremely torn between her and another girl that i might have wanted to date and so i described my situation referring to her as "girl 2" and the other one "girl 1" because i didn't want to just give it away that i wanted to date her even if it's obvious enough from my actions she was such a sweetheart helping me sort out my feelings and at the end i sent a "thank you for helping me i'm pretty sure i know where i'm at now ❤️" and she sent something back with a heart at the end as well. i went to daytona for a vacation a little after that and i was bored in the room so i asked if she wanted to see endgame because everyone wants to see it so it's an easy date. she was like "with you" and i said "yeah with you" and i thought i was finally gonna get my date but she pulled up the "but you hate me" thing again. i told her "[f16] we've been over this already, i don't hate you i think you're really great, why would i hate you?" she just said "i know you do" i went into more detail as to why i don't hate her including the fact that it's hard for me to hide emotions so she would know if i hated her, and the fact that we're really alike, ending with "i'm not meany i'm huggy" and she lit up after that "no way" and i said "ya b i g hugs" and she said ":,( i want a hug" i said "well do you want to see endgame together? i'll give you one" she said "i'm in colorado for the next few weeks but yeah i want to go" after that it's just been really slow, she's in colorado for skating stuff and i'm assuming she's just way more busy there because i barely get any texts now and i get self conscious i'm being really annoying and clingy because i initiate all the conversations now and i've brought it up a couple times with her and she says it's not annoying but i've already brought up the fact that none of my friends ever initiate conversations in the past and she brought up herself that she'll try harder to talk to me, which has been the case until recently. i think i'm just pushing her away but i miss talking to her we've got such compatible personalities, she still talks to me like she's interested in me, i haven't had much luck with friends really ever in my life so i can't just be like *i'll just spend some time with friends* off the top of my head i've only had one friend who consistently enjoyed talking to me and initiated conversations but i messed that up by saying something stupid. i don't really know what to do right now i think i should just leave her be until she comes back from colorado and then start up again since nothing is really happening at the moment.	0

hmm. i think i'll make an entire sketchbook dedicated only to my celebrity crushes. now how much weird is that? so i have this sketchbook - and there are some rules on the first page. one of them says that if there's a super ruined page i don't want to look at anymore everytime i flip through it, i draw a face of my celebrity crush all over it with a black ink. (i'm girl, 16 btw) now i have tons of crushes, even in real life. i don't know why, maybe it's because i was never able to talk to boys and they seem super alien to me. and don't worry - my celeb crushes don't affect my everyday life and it only stays in my phone gallery and on youtube playlists. and lately i was having this weird idea about buying a sketchbook, that i would fill up only with them. every page would have different paper, colour and pattern and i even honestly think it's a good idea. now that i shared this story, i just want to ask: how do you guys view celebrity crushes? do you think it's unhealthy, or okay? and does anybody else do something similar like me and my sketchbook? (even tho it's obvious this is kinda weird 😄) it's almost 3 a.m here, so good night for now! 😄	0

how to deal with the bureaucracy (specifically, my university dean)? i'm in a huge bind and hoping for some advice (any advice). this past september, i enrolled in a graduate program at one of the ivies. within 2.5 weeks, i realize i dislike the program intensely and can't justify paying for the degree. i talked to my advisor, dropped my classes, and left the school. it was very early on in the year at this point, and i hadn't paid tuition yet. the finaid office tells me i don't owe anything because i fall within the school's 100% refund schedule. then a few weeks ago, i received a bill from the university for almost $10,000. i almost cry when i see this. it's more money than i spent on my 4-year ba from a state college. and keep in mind, the $10,000 is for ~10 days of just a single class (we run on a block schedule). after calling, e-mailing, and visiting the school for 3 weeks in order to try to understand my bill, i finally get a cold email from the dean of financial aid. the e-mail states that my class was a special exception to the normal refund schedule on the website (because of block scheduling) and so i was charged on a prorated basis. meaning i didn't qualify for a refund. (this prorated policy isn't written explicitly anywhere, btw. nor was it mentioned by anyone else in the finaid office before/after my withdrawal.) i also am told i don't qualify for financial aid (since i'm not a student). i asked to meet him in person to explain my financial situation and the wrong information i'd received, but he simply replied: "all i can tell you is what i've written here". so, what are my options here? if i don't pay now, the bill gets forwarded to a collection agency (which sounds like a pretty bad thing?) i'm planning on visiting the dean's office anyway, but i'm not sure how to use my ignorance and sad-sap "i'm broke" excuse to make him change these arbitrary rules for me. i'm not sure i'll get any sympathy for that. has anyone had any luck dealing with the seemingly cold/soulless university™️ bureaucratic system? honestly, i've had more luck dealing with at&t... any even slightly related advice would be deeply appreciated. i have never been in a situation like this before. thanks in advance for tolerating my whining.	0

help my mother screamed at me when she wanted me to drop out for community college at 15, and i wanted to just change schools so i'm not bullied. "don't try because i'll win." she screamed at me when i said i wanted to go to college after failing school. "you never do anything to help yourself." she wondered why i don't say anything. she said "you have to turn everything into an argument" when i tried to explain why i want antidepressants, even though she doesn't want me on them. i experienced antidepressant withdrawal and she'd sarcastically go "poor you. you have it so tough." she didn't believe me when i said i wanted to commit suicide until we saw a counsellor. i'd repeatedly hear "you're too sensitive", "can't say anything around you." she would give me so much constant criticism that i just didn't want to be in her view. if i had a task to do, i'm not going to do it in front of her. she threatened to cancel university when i said i feel like i have to justify everything. "don't get cross." now i've left home and they're kind. but i just want to give up. i'm in $50k debt and dropped out from 4 institutions when i could have just been supported instead and not be in a train wreck. i had behavioural problems and lost a tonne of friends in the process. i'm very alone. 😟	1

⚠️trigger warning (rape)ah, hello reader! after debating which subreddit would be the most fitting, i guess this one is the one i felt might be most suitable based off i currently feel. i feel so fucking (pardon my language) disgusting. i have never felt so appalled by my own physical being. i seriously do not want to be here right now. to be upfront, last night i was raped by a stranger. i do not remember any of the actual event, and maybe it's for the best (?) but, when you know, you know. i have taken the right steps following what has happened, or well, at least the necessary ones. i've already also talked to my mom, close family and friends i just feel like nobody has been able to say anything i could get any help out of. understandable. not that i'd expect any of them to fully be able to know what to say or do. i would probably react similarly and say some of the same things they've told me. i just can't shake how literally absolutely 1000000% disgusting i feel. i've been shaken up all day, both mentally and physically. i have so much anxiety. i don't know what to do right now. i have debated calling the crisis hotline, however, i really would just like to be in the comfort of my own bed (my literal safe place) and i know the things that i would disclose wouldn't allow for that to happen. :( alas, if you made it this far...thank you for taking the time to read my post. it means more than you think. i just wanted to get that off my shoulders.	1

this life is getting old. this month, i am contemplating goodbye 👋 today, i lost the best job i've ever had, at least in terms of salary, benefits, opportunity for advancement, etc. i have been lost and constantly trying to find purpose in my life but it has really taken a toll. i feel free, but very lost. i'm confused on what path to go down. wake up tomorrow to apply to jobs, try and let my mind focus on a plan (potential failure), or plan the end. i've honestly lived a happy life and i sometimes don't see the point of going on. this world exerts so much pressure on us. we all handle it differently but this pressure i am dealing with now; i'm 50/50 on if i want to face it. i love growth and overcoming obstacle but it gets old after a while. this life of constantly getting knocked down and trying to get back up again is not fair and it takes a toll. what a way to start off at 28 years old	1
the kindness of our parents we only have one mother and one father, and from the moment we were born, we relied on them heavily for everything. a parent's love is the closest thing resembling unconditional, selfless love that we can find within the universe, and because we have a strong affinity with our parents, we were born into their lives, becoming a significant part of the being. the special bond we share with our parents is often taken for granted because it's all we've ever known, experiencing their undying love from our very first breath until their very last. in this article, we share the many ways our parents' love have impacted our lives and how we can practice filial piety as an expression of our gratitude and appreciation towards them. thanks for reading, and may you and your parents be happy, healthy and peaceful 😊❤️🙏 [<url>](<url>)	0

introducing my teacher to my doctor back when i attended community college, i took a french class to cover my language requirements for my major. my teacher (who i'll just call m for madame, which is what we called her) was a decent enough teacher, but she had a very strict rule; absolutely no phones in class. never take it out and if it rang in class, she would answer it. i silenced my phone every time i went class. except that day. that one day. the day came of one of our regular exams. yep, perfect day for something like this. i was feeling pretty good about this particular exam as i had been having an easy time understanding the particular subject matter (which i've all but forgotten now, because of course i have). m handed out our exams and the room was quiet. i'm breezing through it, the weather is finally warm so i get to wear shorts, the sun is shining. what could go wrong? 🎶who's phone is ringing?! mine! mine! who's phone is ringing?! mine! it's mine!!!🎶 (whoever knows where that song is from, here's a free cookie 🍪) i feel my world crumble as my phone screams this on full volume from a pocket in my backpack. i don't need to look around to know everyone is staring at me. i can feel it. before i can have any further reactions, m yanks my phone from my backpack and answers it. seconds feel like hours as she listens to the phone call, not really saying much of anything (found out later the call was a recording). everyone in the room was either staring at her or me. i'm glad i was wearing shorts because i could feel my entire body burning. it can't get more embarrassing than this, right? eleven herbs and spices of wrong. m finally hangs up and hands me back my phone. what she said next, i will never forget. "op, you have an appointment with your gynecologist on thursday." cue the laughter and me seriously debating whether or not to jump out the window to my death. i finished my test as fast as i possibly could and got the fuck out of dodge. moral of the story kids, always make sure your phone is silent in class. by the way, i got an 89% on the test, so at least there's that. tl;dr i forgot to silence my phone and it rang during a test. my teacher answered it and told me in front of everyone i have an appointment with my gynecologist.	0

my first day at a new job was today. i started operating a forklift at an alcohol distribution center. warehouse work. never driven one before but it's so fun! we unload the incoming trucks onto pallets then just move the pallets where they need to go. super simple, plus i'm making more than what i was at my old job which i hated. i also get a $1.50 raise after my first 90 days! my coworkers were all really cool and they made the day fly by. my girlfriend was kind enough to make me dinner and give me massage when i got home as congratulations for finally getting a job. i've been unemployed for a month after i got discharged from the army. oh well, tough shit, life goes on and i learned a lot of valuable life skills from the military. it's been a good day. definitely looking forward to that first paycheck. 😊	0

keeping oni got a good job, good friends and family and i still think about killing myself everyday. i don't really understand why. corona has really driven my mental health down. for the last year i would only casually think about suicide like this sucks i'll just kill myself lol. over the past few weeks it's been more serious like how would i do it?, what would i write for a note?. i know i don't want to die, i just want to stop feeling so worthless and overwhelmed. i knew something was off so last week i took a leave of absence from work and have been running and mediating everyday. i thought the road to recovery would be linear but it is very up and down. i'll hang out with friends and look completely normal but then right before bed i'll feel like shit. i truly hope nobody ever has to experience depression but that unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case. this sucks and i hope we can get through whatever it is we are going through. love you all! ❤️❤️❤️ better together ❤️❤️❤️	1

why does everyone abandon me? i'm nearly 22, i used to have so many friends in school and we all live in the same area so we used to hang out nearly every day, now i've been completely excluded from my 'friends'. i see them having a great time on social media without inviting me. it's gone on for a few years now and i'm still not over it and i don't think i ever will be. if you knew me personally you would know that i always try to be nice to people and don't do confrontation. i don't even smoke or do drugs i asked my ex bestfriend why everyone hates me and she said that they don't 'hate' but dislike because apparently i play dumb and i fake my accent trying to sound american like wtf! they know that i have a brain disease (that kills brain cells) that my dad passed away from when i was 13 called 'huntinton's disease' that's another reason why i'm suicidal but this is not what this post is about but i'm not going to be able to walk, talk , eat, function properly and my symptoms are going to start in just over 8 years - so obviously i'm not smart-my brain cells are litrally dying! but for them to think i'm faking really hurts and to be excluded for it? and it really pissed me off about my accent because it's the way i talk i can't help it! i don't even think i sound american. i told my ex bestfriend that i felt like jumping off a bridge and she told me that i was being dramatic. - great friend i had. also i can't stand being dumb because it's stopped me from getting a job- i always get fired. never good enough, it really gets to me. my first and only ever true love that i'm still madly in love with we started dating when we were 13/14? and were together for 6 years and he left me for someone he met at the nightclub...and now he has a baby and they are engaged. he was my first and only everything and i always thought we would make it through whatever. i tried getting over him by dating but a guy led me on told me he liked me constant kissing me, inviting me over to his house completely leading me on and saying he doesn't want a relationship in general. now he has a girlfriend... i dated some one else for a few months who also left me for someone else. i'm so lonely why does everyone abandon me? i can't stop myself from crying everynight. i feel so shit about myself i hate the way i look and i'm fat and i'm going to die alone i have nothing to live for. it's making me isolate myself even more i'm counting down the days until i can kill myself. 😔	1

idk what i did, bois. ive been texting this girl constantly for the past 2ish months, we even moved from snapchat to *texting* because it seems more personal. but for the past week or so, she has been answering very poorly, like only a few times a day. no longer saying goodnight, only saying goodmorning if i do. yesterday we got in like 5 texts tbh, and in the gap of many hours between her answering me she literally put something on her snapchat story. yikes. so as she kept not answering, for over 8 hours, i would just occasionally check and see if she was active on any social media, and she was all the time. yikes pt 2. she literally didnt answer me past 2pm yesterday, yet she was on her phone literally constantly throughout the day. and to top things off, she told me this morning that she had no service, no internet, all day yesterday. so uh, yikes pt 3. i have no idea what i did. but she honestly was one of, if not the most, trustworthy people i knew. not so much now tbh🤔	0

tinnitus is testing me honestly...fuck this. i'm a 21 year old tortured male with several severe mental and physical health conditions that make my life a waking nightmare. i will decline to elaborate here on my conditions and broken life because it's too much personal information. it will suffice to say it's more than bad: others would have killed themselves in my place years ago. i've suffered enough to the point where acquiring tinnitus is pushing me over the edge. i don't have the means to end it anymore but i wish i had a way out. i don't want to suffer anymore. i aborted a suicide attempt a few months ago and i'm already regretting being condemned to an existence where i no longer enjoy life or have the opportunity to create a decent one. tinnitus took my silence, pieces of my sanity, and my last shreds of a will to live. i just want it to stop. 😭	1

my (32f) husband's (32m) friendship with his friend's fiance so, this is something that has been bothering me a little bit, but maybe it shouldn't be. my husband has a male friend (we'll call him andrew) who recently became engaged to a woman (we'll call her melissa) that he's known for about 1.5 years. my husband was introduced to the fiance a few months after they started dating, so they haven't known each other for a very long time. anyway, we all have a group chat (the 4 of us) but i've known for a few months that my husband texts melissa privately, also. as far as i know it's not anything inappropriate so i haven't said anything. i'm not very close with her, not sure if she likes me very much, and she and i do not ever text privately- i don't even have her name saved in my phone, just her phone number shows up when she texts us in the group text. the private texts have been bothering me over this weekend though because i happened to see one of her texts to him over his shoulder the other night and it said something along the lines of, "i'm so glad that andrew has a friend that i can be a total psycho in front of ♥️ ." (there was an actual heart emoji in it, i'm not exaggerating). there has been a lot of drama with andrew's family regarding the wedding, and one particular family member who we'll call sarah was recently kicked out of the wedding party. so basically all weekend my husband has been constantly texting melissa and andrew. he also seems to emphatically take melissa's side regarding all of the drama and seems completely blind to any part that she has in it. i don't care about it, it's not my drama, but he was explaining to me that the wedding party had all been asked to reserve rooms at the hotel for the wedding for two nights: the night of the rehearsal dinner and the night after the wedding. melissa's parents are paying for rooms for the wedding party for the night of the rehearsal dinner, but everyone in the party is expected to pay for their own rooms for the second night. after sarah was kicked out of the wedding party, melissa called the hotel and canceled sarah's room reservation for both nights. sarah was upset that melissa had canceled the room on the second night, even though her parents weren't paying for that one, sarah would have been paying for it. my husband was laughing about how "ridiculous" sarah was being, so i said, "well, sarah knows she was kicked out of the wedding party, i don't know that she knew she had also basically been uninvited to the wedding..." and he kind of scoffed at that and was like, "well, she wasn't uninvited..." but i feel like if the bride cancels your room reservation on the night of the wedding, that basically means in a not so subtle way that you're uninvited from the wedding... he can't seem to see that though. like i said, not my wedding, but it bothers me that he can't seem to see any faults in melissa. melissa can be rude, too, and he was also scoffing at the fact that sarah had said melissa has always been rude to her. i almost feel like my husband has a thing for melissa, and what's holding him back is loyalty to andrew, not to me. i should also mention that something similar happened with one of andrews ex girlfriends (he would text her privately regularly) and when that relationship was going south in the end, she was even texting my husband about her sex life with andrew. my husband told me about this and said that it made him uncomfortable, but he kept texting back and forth with her until i asked him to stop, because i didn't think that was appropriate at all. i am not friends like this with my friends' significant others- the only reason i'd ever text a friend's husband/fiance/ boyfriend would be to plan a surprise party for my friend... otherwise i would just feel weird and like i was overstepping a boundary by getting so cozy with my friend's so. should i be weirded out by this whole thing, or just ignore it unless something worse happens?	0
i'm extremely neurotic and it's making my life helli had an argument with my ex, made a fool of myself and was being very annoying. she ended it with the cruelest message possible. i feel so fucked up by it. it's been 3 months and i still feel depressed because her words destroyed me. they were extremely demotivating because i'm neurotic and things like that always repeat indefinitely in my mind 😓 something died inside of me after it and i'm very scared i'll never get it back again. i'm also so incredibly tired of fighting my mind all the time.. why can't i just be like 'fuck what you've said, i don't care about you..' no, i have to make a big deal of it and let it repeat for months. fuck. never contact your ex when it isn't necessary..	1
what's the point of living anymore. cause of my deep depression and my loneliness i chose to throw in the towel like wanting to kill myself, cause like does anybody care or love me anymore. i sense the forgotteness of being forgotten and it absolutely sucks! 😢😔	1
i don't wanna live in a never ending nightmare anymore. i just want to kill myself. (update) i've really taken some time to consider what i said. i always know it can get better, and after talking to a lot of friends and my family, i'm okay for now. thank you to the people who helped me out, i really can't thank you enough. 💜	1
my (25f) boyfriend (30m) is having an emotional affair and keeps lying about it. **tldr; my boyfriend lied about an emotional affair, told me he was breaking it off with her, and then actually just took her out on a date and can't understand why i'm upset.** **i would give backstory but to be honest this is already too long so i'll just jump right in*****.*** my boyfriend gave me his phone about 2 weeks ago to put some music on, and while i did a message popped up from a girl i didn't recognise (let's call her sarah) with something like "i'm 5"6, what about you 😉". i didn't say anything, and i didn't bring it up or really think about it that much. over the next week i happened to notice (not by actively checking, but if you live with another person you'll know that you just notice if the same name is always popping up on their phone) that she was messaging him an awful lot. i didn't say anything because hey, maybe they're just friends, i'd hate to be that jealous controlling girlfriend that doesn't let their partner talk to anyone of the opposite sex. he finished work at 3pm and we had plans to hang out together, but instead he texted me saying he was going for a drink and would be back at 4:30. i replied saying that was cool, out of interest who was he going out with? he just replied saying he was "catching up with an old friend". i asked if it was anyone i might know, and at about 4:15 he said it was a girl called sarah, and i immediately knew it was the same sarah that had been popping up on his phone all week. at this point my gut feeling told me he was up to no good, but i didn't want to sound paranoid so told myself i was being crazy and texted him to say i hope he had fun. at 5pm he replied that he might be a bit longer as they're still out, but he'll definitely be back for 5:30. at 7:30pm i hadn't heard anything and didn't know whether to make plans for dinner etc so i called him and asked if everything was okay - i could tell on the phone he was quite drunk and didn't seem to want to talk to me, he said he'd be back for 8. when he did get back i asked him how his night was and if he had fun catching up with this "old friend". he got quiet for a moment before saying that he'd lied. she wasn't an old friend (shocker), he said he'd met sarah online a week before, when i was across the country for a few days looking after my mum who was sick. he said he thought she was attractive and cool and they'd gone on a sort-of date. they met up at 3, got drunk and kissed etc. and then he told her at about 7 that actually he had a girlfriend and she (understandably) got really annoyed. he said he was sorry and that they agreed to just be friends. i was quite hurt, i was hurt he'd lied to me, i was hurt he'd gone on a date with another girl and not told her he had a girlfriend, i was hurt that while i was away caring for my sick mother he was taking the opportunity to find other girls. but i told him it was okay and that while i was upset he'd lied, it was fine. i made us dinner and we didn't speak about it all night. about a week later i was leaving for work and he told me that he was going out with sarah again tonight while i was working. i said okay, are you going out as friends or are you going out as something more? he got quite defensive and said "obviously" it was just as friends and that i sounded crazy. i didn't want to stir anything up so i just said i hoped he had fun, but that i didn't really want him to get off with her again. he again said i was being paranoid and i didn't want to start an argument so i ended up just leaving for work. when i got home he said he'd gone out in town with her and they'd had a great night - just as friends. i won't lie, i was still a little bit jealous of sarah but thought you know what, if they've decided they're just friends then that's okay because i'd hate to dictate who he can and can't be friends with. this was about a week ago, they've definitely still been messaging a lot and i've noticed that recently he's been making ever-so-subtle efforts to keep his messages more hidden - for example, if he leaves his phone in the room with me, he often puts it onto airplane mode. and now we're at yesterday, wednesday. he called me up and said he had a "surprise" for me - he'd rented a car for the weekend and was taking me away somewhere friday-monday. i was happy, obviously, it was really sweet and i was really grateful. i thought that maybe he felt bad about the whole situation and was trying to make it up to me - not that he has to take me away to make it up to me, but you know what i mean. i met him from work and told him i was really excited - he said we're leaving friday evening. then he said he's picking the car up today - i asked why he was paying for 2 extra days when we don't need it until friday? he said he wants to take sarah out for a drive tonight. i asked if i could come, i said they're obviously good friends and i'd really like to meet her (this was a bit mean of me i know, as i knew something was going on that he wasn't admitting and i know it sounds bad to force him into a corner like that but hey he's cheating on me). he said he didn't want me to meet her, he just wanted to "chill with her" on his own. i said if there's a friend that you're so against your girlfriend meeting then that's weird, and it implies something is going on. i suggested we invite a couple of other people and make it a group thing if he thinks it'd be weird just me tagging along - he kept insisting that he just wanted to spend time with her on his own. i got a little bit upset and it developed into a mini-argument where he admitted that he wanted to take her out to "break it off" with her. i asked what he was breaking off - he said he'd lied to me about their relationship and that actually he thought she was developing feelings for him and wanted him to break up with me, so he was going to tell her they shouldn't see each other anymore. i asked if he was developing feelings for her, he got quiet and just replied that he thinks she's "really cool", but she wants him to break up with me which he doesn't want to do and he doesn't want to hurt me or her so he's going to end it. he said they've been messaging and flirting all week and he thinks it's going too far. i said that i appreciate his honesty, that i wish he'd been honest from the start but that i appreciate he's doing the right thing. so he went to pick her up in the car - this is about 7pm, and he got back at around 11. i asked him how it went, did she get angry, did she understand, are you not going to see her anymore? i'm sure, as someone less blind and stupid than me, you can guess what happened. he didn't do any of that. he instead drove her up to the beach and took her for dinner, they had a wonderfully romantic evening and they made out at the end of the night. he doesn't see anything wrong with continuing to see her. i asked him what the fuck happened and why he didn't say or do any of the things he said he was going to - he just said that he thinks she's really cool and loves spending time with her. i said but she wants you to break up with me and to be honest i'm really not cool with this - he just said he isn't going to leave me for her so he doesn't know what the problem is. i'm really upset, i don't know what to do. i've been through so much with this guy already, i know it's only been 9 months but i suffered a miscarriage about a month ago and he couldn't have been nicer. he's the only person i've felt confident enough to confide in about my abusive past relationship, and no one has ever treated me so well. i asked him last night if he was going to break up with me to be with her - he said no, and i asked why not. he said that he gets bored with people very quickly - he says i'm the only person he doesn't get bored of, and he thinks he'll get bored of sarah once they've had sex or whatever. the thing is, i don't want to sit around and wait for him to sleep with her and then get bored of her and come back to me. there'll be someone else after her, and someone after her, and i think he's always going to do this. and what if he doesn't get bored of her? he's cheated on me before, but it was just sex and there wasn't any feelings involved which is why this one hurts so much more. he cheated on his ex girlfriend that he really cared about - he had a 6-month long affair behind her back and when she found out and broke up with him he got with the girl he'd been having an affair with. his ex girlfriend is beautiful and absolutely lovely - they were very happy together for a long time. i'm not stupid, i know if he can do that to her he can definitely do that to me. before i met him i was very chill; i never got jealous, i never felt insecure in relationships, and now i feel like i'm constantly on edge wondering if he's doing stuff behind my back. i don't know what to do. i know that people on here will tell me to break up with him, and i wish it was that simple but it's not. well maybe it is but the thing is i still **want** to be with him. i like him a lot, i love spending time with him and i love how he makes me feel but i hate it when he makes me feel like this. i don't want to break up with him, but i really don't want to be the idiot girlfriend that sits at home waiting for him to come home from his other woman. he *admitted* that if the roles were reversed and i'd done this to him, he'd be "heartbroken" so i don't understand why he thinks it's fine to do to me. i'm trying to talk about this with him but he keeps saying i'm just "having a go" and "stressing him out". i don't understand why he refuses to talk about this or admit that he's really upset me. i don't know what to do. sorry this is so long.	0

so my friend and i had a million dollar idea... thotpockets™️ so we're going to open up a stand where we cook hot pockets at 420deg and serve them warm for $5 a pop. what differentiates it from a normal hot pocket is that it doubles as a flesh-light (our target demographic is r/teenagers). don't worry non-existent grils, anything's a dildo if you're brave enough. once you've had your way with it, you have a tasty little snack for that post-masturbation case of the munchies. thotpockets™️ (you can't make your own because of the ™️, we will take legal action) thx to u/halobesteyboo for confounding this corporation with me	0

"to be or not to be, that is the question; whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them." sorry for the cliche, i couldn't help myself. i just need to rant, if for no other reason than to distract myself. i am 24 and have been depressed pretty much every winter (i have sad) for as long as i can remember (the first memory of wanting to commit suicide was when i was 8 begging my mom to let me jump out the 3rd floor window to just end it). i'm on medication, have tried several, even homeopathy and 'natural' shit blah blah blah. it just feels so inevitable, it's like clockwork, something inside my brain just goes wonky and i spiral down into this emotional pit where the pain of existing is often measured in milliseconds. and even when i'm not technically depressed during the summer time, if i think about anything philosophical i'm reminded that i really *should* kill myself (according to my personal philosophy, which i won't bore people with), and this gets so much worse in the winter when i'm drawn to think about philosophical/existential questions. so why stretch the suffering out, if i'm inevitably going to hit the bottom of that pit and muster up the courage to actually kill myself? i have no friends, and when i get out of work i have no energy to go meet people (i'm an introvert even when i'm not depressed). i admittedly have an awesome boyfriend, but he lives across the country, so i'm still basically alone, and i hate it when i bog him down with all my emotional crap (same goes for my parents). i'm not even particularly suicidal/in pain right now, but i just feel so tired of it all. i got two bottles of zzzquil™️ today, ostensibly so i could actually get some sleep for a change, but now i can't stop fantasizing about drinking them both. there's no guarantee that it would work (and it'd probably be rather painful), but i'm not sure why i should even care if i fail. i've been doing stupid morbid shit like googling suicide statistics. i think i could be an outlier for most of them, which gives me a strange sense of satisfaction. anyway, i'm sorry for all the emo.	1

i don't know how to stop myselfi've been pestering people about my problems, knowing i won't be able to be helped anyways. how do i stop telling them what's up with me? how do i stop crying out of nowhere once the spike of bad feeling hits? i'm one of those people who make it obvious that something is wrong, while at the same try to hide it. i feel selfish being straightforward, so doing that makes me feel like they get a chance if they wanna ask what's wrong or not. i've had confidence issues my whole life, but they've really taken a bad turn and the downhill turned into a straight drop. every time i see myself from the mirror, i start crying and gagging. i've puked many times recently. never deliberately, like i haven't put a toothbrush down my throat. but i think it's still my fault, i keep torturing myself by looking at beautiful and talented people. showertime is horrible, seeing how abnormal my body looks like. i can't compare to anyone, i don't feel like i'm on the same level at least. i smile at beautiful things, but now it only takes a very small amount of time before i start crying because the feeling gets so bad. i can't go outside too much either anymore. so yeah, i keep seeing amazing, great, beautiful people everywhere...but i won't ever be like that. i'm not enough. so right now i'm trying to push my friends away from me. i don't mean to insult them when i say they should strive for better and not be stuck with me, i don't mean to assume what's best for them and what they should think about me. i don't mean to say they're selfish and only take overlords in their lives. but i guess i am saying it. i've tried apologising for being like this, but made people mad, made them say i'm not actually sorry, just busy determining how they think. i'm getting annoying with this, since i won't just learn after one message. i feel like i'm constant trouble, so that's why i'm asking how could i just hide it all. never bother anyone ever again about my stupid problems. i just can't understand why'd they want to keep me around. i'm sort of happy that everyone's getting sick of it and me. when they leave, well...they can smile again. they won't have the extra baggage anymore. everyone's happiness is so nice, of course i'll be alone but once everyone's forgotten about me, i can vanish. i can only hope the 4th floor will be enough if i have to make that decision. i'm sorry about the long message, but thank you for reading. 🐻🌻	1

corrosion of my brain.i don't have a bank account nor a license my individual dependency is so low i honestly couldn't function without- i dont know my mum? i've lived so long without meaning, at first it was awesome no stress in the world no one is dependent on you, in a way your virtually free from all of life's modern stress. year goes by still living in the state of not having to worry about getting a job having to find food etc but coming onto three years and i'm 18- still here not progressed with living independently ⏳, it's not just that days become repetitive, 3 years of memories similarity blur into one, and it's of me starring at my ceiling. guys i feel- i can't even describe how i feel into language, my brain feels just like it's deteriorating, i have no self confidence to be able to get a job. one failure is enough for me to slowly self-destruct even if things go good afterwards. i'm so lazy but not in the cleanliness sense but in doing something active with my life, i do push to make things better but even if things go good it's this self destructive behaviour i can't seem to tackle. being brought up quite roughly has made me have a "nothing really matters" vibe to it, not that i dear show or express that's the way i feel about things those thoughts are %100 lurking with every action i do.. i want-- i don't know what i want, i want not this.	1

no job, no friends, and family that sees me as a disappointment.i know these type of posts are seen all the time so i don't expect a lot of interaction with mine. i just need a place to vent since i really have no one else to go to. i've felt like a loner for years now but i'm at my absolute lowest at the moment. the one companion of mine that i had for almost 8 years, my dog, passed away last month. i always said i wouldn't kill myself as long as he was here with me and now that he's gone i see no other reason to keep going. i graduated from college this past december and haven't been able to land a job since. most days i just sit and play video games because i just get so angry at all the rejection from employers who say they're hiring for entry level but require 2+ years of experience. i don't have any skills. i tried to learn programming but honestly i'm just not very tech savy and i just don't have enough time to learn before my situation gets worse. i feel like i've let my family down, especially my grandma and mom who sacrificed so much to get me to college. killing myself would just be doing them a favor. at least i would no longer be a burden. the people i thought were my friends grew up and got lives and just abandoned me in the process. only things that seems to keep me somewhat happy are sex and alcohol. i don't see myself being the type of person to commit suicide by hanging or an overdose but honestly if the rampant sex with strangers won't kill me, the alcohol poisoning sure will. 🙃	1
faith has been restored! i was volunteering at a summer camp today and it was time for outdoor games for the kids (6-8 years old) the game was basically do whatever you want just don't get hurt and the councilors were told to supervise so that's what i was doing. anyways, i was by a play set and one kid yells "no councilors on the play set!" and the rest start chanting that😂 the fun part is that after a few seconds, one boy says "he can come on if he likes minecraft" and i enjoys a few blissful minutes atop the play set	0

my girlfriend texting another guy i'm a guy, 21, and my gf [20] of about 2 years has a guy friend that she's very friend to. to be honest, it seems like she's friendlier to all her friends than to me by a long shot. but i suppose that's not my issue as of right now. i saw she was texting this guy, and i was stupid enough to look in her phone and check it out. it's all very very sweet friendly messages, using words like "love" and "b", but that is circumstantial to a point. not that i like it, but it's not definitive of anything. however, i found something that made my stomach turn. since i can't post images i'll type it word for word. (chad is the guy, k is my gf) chad: i do but i just don't wanna make myself look like an idiot by trying that shit again 😂 k: what do you mean by an idiot? like 😂 like where are you coming from with this my guy chad: no like haha i dont want to try and kiss you and stuff like i usually do because i know it makes me look like an idiot and i don't want you to think i only hang out with you because of that because it's not true and i just don't want to make myself look dumb when i see you and when we are alone it's hard because sometimes i can't help myself and i know you don't want it so this time is gonna be different 😤 k: i don't want it? lol if i didn't want it then it wouldn't happen silly but i get what you're saying and i respect that you don't look like an idiot to me but i still love you and can't wait to see you chad: i love you too b so yeah. maybe i'm crazy. but that seems very... not great to me. and it's burning a hole in my stomach. most of the rest of the messages are her begging to hang out with him and being overwhelmingly supportive of him (support that i don't even get). i know that most people reading this are just gonna tell me i shouldn't be snooping in the first place, but i did. it was stupid. but now here i am. does anyone have any advice? a new angle? better interpretation? i mean... what should i do?	0

being the harmless looking tall, vacant guy with a place to sit next to. today in my class i was sitting alone on the second last bench by the window and then a group of three girls came in, out of which two of them sat on the vacant bench in front of me. the third one was all about sitting with me but just then i heard one of the other girl whispering, "look at him, he looks so innocent and harmless, he's cute too but he's a tad bit too tall. go sit somewhere else." b!t©️# didn't let me understand whether i should have taken that as a compliment or as an insult 😐 all of my day got spent wondering about that and now it's almost 12 of midnight here and i still haven't reached a conclusion yet. i need a closure to all this. ps - i'm 189cm(1.89m) tall. . tldr - sat at the back of the class. a classmate needed someone to sit next to, discussed with her friends about my cute and innocent(harmless) look getting my hopes up and then shattered them by saying that i'm too tall.	0
my bf (50m) threatens to leave me (22f) on a daily basis for another woman my bf is still married on the road to getting divorced (i did not meet him until after he decided to divorce her). i am very insecure and it seems he takes advantage of that. whenever i give him "attitude" he leaves to go to the house she stays at. when we get in fights he says she looks better everyday. he says the next time i give him attitude he will go and fuck her just out of spite. now, i do have a big mouth and i do have a bad attitude (due to my insecurities that he feeds constantly). do you guys think he is doing this out of love? i don't want to leave him, but i don't know how much longer i can take this. he says all i have to do is fix my attitude and he's good. however, words stick. i can't bring myself to trust him and in turn i get very distant and moody. i get whiplash from all the things he says and i don't bounce back easily. it sort of feels like a nasty cycle. i tell him that i understand what i need to do to get better but him saying the things he says is not making it easier for me (he doesn't care). i am hidden from everybody and i can't talk to anyone about these issues and he does not want to listen. it doesn't help that his ex-wife is still is sending him lovey messages and emails. he doesn't tell her to stop or anything to let her know it's not ok. now they aren't divorced yet, and they do have a lot of finances tied together so i figure that has something to do with it. i'm just scared and stressed all the time. i feel weak and worthless in this relationship.. he takes care of everything financially so i feel like i don't really have the right to complain. but i just can't take it anymore. am i being selfish and spoiled? tl;dr my boyfriend (50m) doesn't respect me (22f) and threatens to leave me for his ex wife on a nearly daily basis due to my attitude. 📷**replyforward**	0
it's all so fucking hopelessit's funny, i have "freinds" but most of them don't like me, they just use me. i have a part of a family, they kicked me out and pushed me around, made fun of me, berated me. i fucking despise the bitch i call a mother, i want to fucking strangle her, all the punches all the drugs all the beating everything. i hate myself, the only person i have left is my grandma, once she dies i go with, prolly to hell to, where peices of shit like me belong haha🤣. isn't it so funny, laugh at me, i know no one really cares, everyone just scouts this forum to feel like a savior, in reality, your all the people that watch people like me jump add the roof with your phones pulled out. just give me some encouragement to die, i want to feel like i'm ready to kill my self by the time i'm done drinking myself silly.	1

i can't keep doing thisi'm just so beyond done with life like, i don't want to continue living at all. nothing makes me happy and i mean not a single damn thing. i've gained a bunch of weight, i have no friends, no skills or hobbies, like life is just meaning less to me. i don't want to work at all, i also don't want to get money from the government. all i want is death at this point. i don't want a future, i don't want a happy life, i just want death. its all i can think about and ive been trying to kill myself these past couple days but obviously i can't even do that. i'm just so tired of living like why can't i choose to end my life. i never asked to be born, i never asked for this life and now i'm supposed to be forced to survive just because maybe possibly in the future it could get a little bit better. no fuck that, i can't live like this much longer i just can't 😢😢 for the love of god plz i want to die	1

just came back from a traumatic gaming experience i was playing fallout 76 , and i minding my own bizness, until i heard a girl in game chat . she was with a group of friends and they were talking about some stupid political stuff . when they them mentioned how some people need cut their mesgintic crap , that's when i got furious. i plugged in my mike , and told them how girls shouldn't make fallout political, and they shouldn't be playing video games in the first place . to my surprise her friends defended her , what a bunch of simps, saying that i was mesgintic. it got really heated until they muted me . i just don't understand, why the gamers wouldn't support in taking down this pretender making my a political game political. ☹️😡	0

another suicide in the family male suicide is such an epidemic, i found out that my younger cousin's dad took his own life last night 😞 absolutely terrible. i am worried for my cousin as he's only 18, has no siblings and has always been very socially isolated and has mild learning needs. he is very vulnerable... so incredibly sad and painful. also i heard that if you have an immediate family member who have taken their life then you have a statistical likelihood of being much more likely to take your own, so i am very worried for him. his poor mum is shattered, although they hadn't been in a relationship for many years i think she's so sad for her poor son. he is the 3rd male i know who has taken his life in the past 4 years. a few years ago my 17 year old cousin took his own life and his family are absolutely shattered to this day. so terribly, terribly sad. for many years i had a daily battle with suicidal thoughts and seeing the harm that suicide brings is so sad to see. i am sending every one that feels this great pain so much love. xxxxxxx	0

trying to talk to my so's niece so there's this picture she posted and she's in a bathing suit that she knows doesn't fit. it barely covers anything. i commented on it and said it wasn't very appropriate because it isn't. and most of her friends are guys that are way older. she's hardly 16. anyways the argument went like this: me- that's not very appropriate😯 her- it's just a bathing suit and its hard for me to cover up since my tits are huge. me- it's pretty low though. so- then buy a bathing suit that fits. i'll buy you hundreds her- calm down👌 she then proceeded to claim that the older guys were her age. that bothers me and so because some of them are literally full time college guys. and she thinks she can get away with anything because there's a newborn in her house. now so is irritated and i may have ruined a family relationship.	0

it's world suicide prevention day - please donate to my afsp fundraiser! through all of my struggles, i really believe that a key to living is giving. advocacy and charity have given me a sense of purpose in a world that often leaves me feeling isolated and hopeless. today is world suicide prevention day. on october 20, i will be participating in the out of the darkness walk in santa monica for the american foundation for suicide prevention. my team goal is $2,000. if you can donate anything from $1, $5, or $100 - it would mean the world to me. if you want to join my team and walk with me, that would be ever better. 💚 we walk for those of us who have lost someone, who have almost lost someone, or who for those of us who have almost lost ourselves. we walk to bring hope, end stigma, and heal our community. - suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the us - on average, there are 123 suicides per day - for every suicide, 25 attempt - suicide costs the us $69 billion annually [<url>](<url>)	1

i made an internet friend and what we had is kind of over and honestly i'm sad. we didn't say much to each other, just replying the same thing to each other's comments and i don't know. i always smiled when i saw he replied back. i'd tell my friend who knows about it, and i'd say "he replied back again!" and then she'd say "woo" and it was always a thing i looked forward to. sometimes he'd be gone for a couple of days and i'd worry that he forgot, but he never did. and now it's over and i'm just a bit more melancholy. you know? like the moment was here, and the moment has passed. such is life i suppose, but i enjoyed our moment. ❤️	0
when did i become so numb? so before i post this: first, no i have no regrets and i don't usually cry for help, second, no i don't care if people will miss me. im so emotionally detached from he world a smile comes with my job description. ive become so good at hiding my depression and sadness people cant even see it anymore. i live in a veil of joy under a dark burka of shame regret and despair. its easy to hide pain under a mask 😷. im in pain, it hurts to think about what my life is so i take so many drugs, drink copious amounts of alcohol, and smoke packs of cigarettes a day, only to try and block the memory of yesterday. sex has even lost its point. some days i can wake up and live life but others i feel suicide is just easier than getting out of bed at 3pm. therapy does nothing, medication only costs more money that doesnt help, ive been on vacations and breaks from drugs and booze but it only seems to make things worse. am i just crazy? a psychopath? when did i become so numb to everything and everyone? if i died today i know many would care but i have no sadness over their feelings orlose.	1

i hugged and held hands with my favorite girl while watching toy story 4 today. my best friend and i have had a very complicated relationship over the past year, but over the past week we decided to forget all of it and love each other. we won't be official until school starts again, but we do say i love you and send tons of heart emojis. we missed each other and our friends a lot so we met up with them all and saw toy story 4. i hugged her before the movie started and after a few minutes in, when it got dark, i held her hand for most of the movie, fingers intertwined and all. our theater has big reclining seats so there's a lot of room. she eventually scooted close to me and rested her head on my shoulder. it was wonderful and i want it to happen again. i did it bois 😎😎😎😎😎😎	0

a couple things to mull over. so here are some questions to maybe think over and if you want we can talk about it :) if there was a list made of how you spent every minute of your life what do you think you would feel about it? what would you look to find out? if someone made a parody of you what do you think would be included in the parody? this would be things like how you talk or your different ticks. and also on your personality. ____ thanks for reading 🐻	0
i really wanna die.i think i have gender dysphoria, some days i'm really confident that i'm trans, and other days i'm not sure. i hate this. i'm worried. what if i transition then change my mind? i don't think i'll look good anyways. i care what i look like, i don't wanna look like a man with long hair. i don't wanna look ugly, but i probably will if i transition. sometimes i'm like really confident this is what i want, i wanna be a beautiful girl, i can't stand being a man, i can't live this way. and sometimes i'm ok with being a man, which makes me worry. i worry, is this just a phase? will i get over it? idk i've been feeling this way for over a year. ⚠️ trigger warning ⚠️ going into r/transtimelines hurts me a lot, because i either: - see a beautiful women, and get really jealous, and think how i'll never be that beautiful. - see a not as passable women, and get really worried, because i'll probably turn out like them. i'll probably be a really ugly girl. also all the hate is getting to me. "transwomen aren't real woman", "tranny", etc. i haven't even told anyone irl yet. i worry they'll judge me too. i'm really unsure, and this is really getting to me. i don't know how i'll kill myself, but i'm really thinking about it.	1
it was a good day today was a good day. i woke up at 5am...had coffee and took a shower. i cut the fuck out of my leg while shaving ( new razor ) , got dressed and put my make up on. it was raining where i live but i was reminded by a good friend that i'm his sunshine. made me smile. did my hair nice and cute and played with my 2 year old. i did dishes and laundry and organized and then made dinner. i had a doctors appointment today and that went well ( i'm healthy ) and then i got my kids ready for the day tomorrow. it's been a good day for me and it's been a long time since i had a good day so this is huge for me. tomorrow i get some me time and i can't wait. taking care of me is a hard job because i sacrifice so much for my kids and i forget about me. i have my outfit all picked out and my boots ( knee high ) all ready. i think i'll have a good day tomorrow as well 😄	0

i (17m) think my friend (16f) might be into me and i don't know how to approach it. i'm going to start off by saying that i'm extremely dense, so i don't assume things at all (it's easier this way). but, when i do assume things, i over think and over analyse them. just for context. one recent example is that i think i said she was attractive (she has low self esteem) and she replied back 'not true but you are' over text. i didn't think much of it then but now i'm over analysing it. another is when i sent a funny picture of a mutual friend to her and she replied 'cute' as a joke. i was like 'i'm jealous' and she took it seriously and said 'don't be it's not a big deal', 'think about it, who am i talking to right now 😂😂😂😂😂'. the first part makes it sound like she's saying that i'm cute and that she's interested, but the '😂's confuse me as it seems like it's in a friendly way. this is probably overthinking it. so, after these recent examples i'm asking reddit as a second opinion on these two things, and how to approach it with her if i need to. tldr~ i feel like my friend is giving me mixed signals (romantically) and want to ask about it, what should i do?	0

i had to post a set of instructions for a 3d printer on the internet for a level i.c.t., so i decided to choose reddit how to setup a 3d printer (instructions are for a "makerbot®️ replicator" 3d printer as it is one of the most common 3d printers out there) 1. open the packaging, carefully remove the printer and place on a flat surface making sure you have enough space and that it won't get knocked onto the floor easily. 2. in the packaging you will find two cables, a power cable and a usb cable, insert the into the correct sockets in the back of the machine, the usb cable goes into the rectangular socket and the power cable goes into the square socket with a rounded top. 3. plug the other end of the power cable into to a wall socket and turn the plug on. 4. flip the power switch on the back of the machine; you should see a red light on the top of the extruder (printing head), and the printing chamber light up a soft purple colour telling you that it has finished powering up. 5. going back into the box, you will find a black reel with a white coloured wire wrapped around it, this is the spool filament, remove it from the box and place it on the filament holder located on the back of the machine above the wire sockets, push the spool filament until it clicks into place. 6. feed the filament through the filament guide tube (the smaller of the two wires leading to the extruder). 7. remove the filament guide tube from the extruder and feed the filament through until you can see it. 8. access the menu on the front of the printer, using the d-pad to navigate, go to "utilities" and then select "load", the extruder will start to warm up. 9. when you hear an electric motor turn on start to feed the filament though the opening at the top of the extruder, take care as the extruder will be very hot. 10. push down firmly until you feel the extruder start to pull the filament through. 11. when you see filament appearing at the bottom of the extruder replace the guide tube back into the extruder. 12. access the menu on the front of the printer to stop the loading process. 13. for the best possible results it is necessary to level the build platform, this will ensure that every print will be at its highest quality. 14. access the menu and select "level build plate", the screen on the printer will guide you through what to do. 15. after the build platform has raised up the meet the extruder, find a piece of paper and adjust the screws under the build plate until there is just enough clearance for the paper to pass between the extruder nozzle and the build platform, but still have a little bit of tension. 16. once this is done, click the red button in the middle of the d-pad and the extruder will move to a new position. 17. repeat the process using the paper and adjusting the screws until the board is fully level with the extruder nozzle. 18. after you've done this connect the printer into the computer and start printing (assuming you have the correct 3d design software).	0

my end is probably near i got a feeling that i'm not gonna be here for the next year. i'm 16 and literally cannot stand living with my parents anymore. it's been awful, yesterday my mom called my grandma and my cousins to the bedroom i was sleeping in (we only have 1 bedroom) and let everyone stay at my bed, making me wake up and completely fuck my sleeping schedule up. when my grandma realized she had waken me up she apologized, but my mom said: "waking him up is great, because otherwise he'd be awake all night long." guess what bitch, i stayed the night awake cuz you woke me up. absolutely awful.😕	0

i made a hamburger today like dang man. i spent time in county jall, have slept in parks, broken into vacant lots, freight trains(and got caught, twice), stolen groceries out of cars, couch surfed, stayed in communes and have done some reasonably sketchy shit to feed myself. i just asked my echo to turn off the television, shut off my stereo, and went to bed to read a book i bought, browse netflix and post on a tablet i refurbrished after i was studying for a cap exam and watching anime. i mean i had a good upbringing, but i kinda thought i'd be dead by now to be honest😌	0

replying to snap story from a girl i went on one date with. so, this one is a little lightweight compared to some of the other stories but i do cringe whenever this comes to mind. also, this did happen a few months ago, not today. a little back story, this girl was someone i had an english class with for the fall semester of 2017 and i had a bit of a thing for her so i started talking her up, i asked for her number and we talked a little from there. we had similar political views and other things in common so we decided to go out for sushi. it was a nice date, nothing spectacular. come to the end of it, i say we should do this again and she seemed down. however, she ghosted me afterwards; it was a little annoying but not a big deal, i moved on. couple months later she moves a few hours north. so this is where the cringe comes in. one evening while i was at work, she posted to her story that she was eating at this restaurant in the city she moved to and it just so happened that it was one of my favorite restaurants i've ever been to. so, i respond to her story saying "that place is the best in the world," or something of the sort. she responded with "yeah it's great!" i decided to say something like, "yeah i've gone there so many times in the past." to which she said, "really? you should come up sometime!" i was like, wait a minute...is she asking me to come up and see her? i mean, i'd be lying if i said it didn't slightly peak my interest a tad. so i replied, "yeah! i'm sure i can find sometime in the near future to do so." now, this is where the cringe is. this is what she said, "oh crap, i thought i was talking to one of my other friends 😂 but yeah, you could come up too!" i sat back after i saw that. i wasn't hurt. i wasn't upset. i just could not get over that lingering awkwardness that i felt after reading that message. so yeah, that's my story of the peak cringe moment in my life so far. like i said, not as intense as others on here but i still think it's worthy in its own right. tl;dr responded to a girl's snap chat story whom i went on one date with in the past, thought she wanted me to come up and see her, turns out she thought she was talking to another friend.	0

even i think my suicide would be selfish and short sighted but here i am anyway this is gonna be a massive wall of text. i need to get this feeling out of my system, and i know better than to kill myself but here i go again anyway. i categorize my problems as within my control, and not within my control. i will categorize this post the same way. things in my control: * i'm not exactly in debt, but i am iminenyly facing the brink of debt and it is facing me back, mouth open, ready to bite. i have $7 and need to replace my car in order not to lose my job, so i can pay for vet bills for my cat, also do things like not be evicted and go to the doctor (reason for doctor in part two: things laughably out of my control). * my living environment is a disaster and i keep getting overwhelmed when i try to rectify this, so it's gotten to be a big scary problem™️ * i am gaining weight because i am depressed and i am depressed that i feel unattractive. * there's probably more but i'm too daft to take ownership of all my current problems because i'm a loser part two: things that are out of my control * i have a physical disability that causes me immense pain on a daily basis. it will only get worse. i am 21 and am losing the ability to walk. * two of my closest relatives, and also my mother in law have died recently and i feel so alone without them. * i am gay and my parents have rejected me and i feel alone. * i moved to a new area and have no friends despite being here for over a year. other contributing factors: * i have the woefully underrepresented and misunderstood form of ocd where i get graphic and violent intrusive thoughts mostly directed toward myself. these images range from wanting to slam my face into a wall until i stop feeling, to prying my ribs apart with a paring knife. these thoughts are triggered by feelings of guilt or embarrassment and can last for minutes. which doesn't sound like a long time but if you're an audience of one to the mind-movie of watching yourself peeling your skin off until you're just meat and bones, it feels tedious at best. (highlight: i have gotten physically sick as a reaction to these thoughts) * i am failing out of school (probably goes in the same category as things in my control, however, there are extenuating circumstances for the most recent semester that even faculty say it's not my fault but here we are anyway with a 0.85 gpa for the semester!!!!) * i cannot talk to my spouse about this matter due to the fact that her mother just died in a highly preventable way at the mere age of 45. also i can't grieve with her family because "i turned her gay" and am not welcome. i cannot begrudge her for being there, but also miss her dreadfully * my cat is probably dying. that's all for now folks! more, as i continue to feel this way possibly	1

am i immature or is she controlling? together for almost 3 years [m21] [f22] my girlfriend is the love of my life, but it makes me sick how she acts when i want to go out on my own. she always says how insecure she is and how uncomfortable it makes her that i want to go out on my own. i try my best to help her get over her insecurities but sometimes i say forget it and disregard how she feels and do what i want. (a little history): she was in a physically and mentally abusive relationship before ours and this is my first serious girlfriend. is she using me as a crutch? your thoughts 🧐	0

creating home made tear gas. for once in tifu history this actually happened today, in fact about 2 hours ago. just a little backstory before we get started: i like to make stuff, creating things has always been a passion for me and i try to make something new on a daily basis. today i was trying to make a coin sorter for all the loose change i have. i started by making a template out of cardboard and cutting it out with a razor blade. all was going well until it was time to glue it up. this is where i fucked up real bad, instead of using hot glue i decided to use super glue. to hold the pieces while gluing i used clear packing tape that stank like a mother. when the glue came in contact with the packing tape a toxic vapor immediately filled the air. my eyes instantly started watering up and i was slowly loosing my vision. the best comparison that could describe the feeling was like taking tabasco®️ sauce and using it for eye drops. in desperation i ran to the sink and started flushing my eyes. for the past 30 minutes my eyes have felt better but they are numb. tldr: made home made tear gas, went blind	0
help i talked to my dad today. he wanted to facetime and i've never done that before. all i could think the whole time was how ugly and scrawny my face looked during it 😞 i am struggling with bulimia, for 20 years on and off, depending on my mental state. all i could could think of during our call was how my face looks old and gaunt. he said i looked great but i have trouble believing that. i moved across the county 5 years ago so he doesn't see me except for random pictures (which i also hate) if he knew i had purged 2-3 times before our call he would be so sad... i feel like such a shit daughter. shit mother, shit wife. why do i hate myself so much and why did talking to my dad trigger such pain and self hate?! 😞 ughhhhhhhh	1

my little kitty ❤️ my little baby girl means the world to me, even if she's only 5 years old. she lays next to me in bed as i weep; sometimes to knead her paws on my chest and lick my fingers to comfort me. if ever i get distressed, she scratches in front of her ear, hurting herself while trying to comfort me. it's gotten so out-of-hand that she is permanently missing fur there, and that makes my heart sink even more. she doesn't meow, afraid it'll annoy me. my mother hates her. my father likes her, but my sister is almost too rough with her. my dad is almost never home; so that leaves me. she always curls herself up on my lap every time i look sad, and she sleeps there, purring softly. she is the only reason i don't commit suicide, and i just want her to be happy. once she passes, my will to live will drop to zero, and i am 99% sure i'll kill myself. she has a few years left, but not many to keep me until i'm even 20. i pray to god that she ends up being alright, but i don't know. i would (literally) die without her.	1

things that grow in the dark. we leave a lot of things unsaid because we are scared to see what happens when someone else knows that thing you keep in the corner of your mind. i think a lot of time that allows it to grow and take over more of your life. we don't allow ourselves to resolve it and it just festers. this is an incredibly safe place though! you are behind a name no one else knows you by. you can carefully say each word to help make sure i understand exactly what you mean by saying certain words scares you because you always trip over them. and you can just always delete it! seeing what you are afraid of in front of you can be just in itself so great. you might feel a bit unburdened or it puts your racing fear laced thoughts into perspective so you can really understand them better. so even if you don't hit send just seeing what you right to yourself is a nice step forward! sharing is also so helpful for everyone else. we all have these internal fears and stuff we don't like about ourselves. we might just share the same fear or self dislike though and that can be a really strong connecting force :) and maybe we can soothe the fear. i don't want you being afraid of yourself or thinking any less of yourself than you should. i am sure you are a great person and i want the full breath of it. not just what you think i want. if you have any questions please ask :) this is a departure from what i usually like to get into but i think it is important not just for you but a community that wants to connect. ___ thanks for reading 🐻	0

i [19f] can't fully trust my bf [22m] for drawing another girl and sending it to her. can i trust him again? backstory: my boyfriend \[22m\] and i \[19f\] have been together for about eight months now and it's ldr. everything has been great, and we try our best to visit each other when we can. long story short, one of his hobbies is drawing and he's actually pretty good at drawing people specifically. we have a lot of mutual friends through greek life and it's how we met too. there was an incident that happened a couple months ago where he saw a girl's selfie on instagram and was "inspired" to draw her. but the thing is, he drew it in the type of way that made her look more flattering? (or at least this was his perception of her? kinda like that anime-ish style) and i found out because she put it on her insta story tagging him. saying "oh my gosh, thanks for making my day @him <3". he's only ever met her once at a party we went to together, and i personally see her often when i go out. of course, when i saw her story i got really jealous and furious. like the idea of him sitting around for awhile drawing this girl into detail that he thought was really good looking and then proceeding to send it to her made me really upset. and i confronted him saying i didn't care about him drawing, but the fact that he sent it to her made me extremely uncomfortable and what he did could be seen as something else. heck if some guy drew a cute picture of myself that i met once at a party i'd be either creeped out or flattered depending. but she clearly was happy from his gesture. he responds by saying that i'm overreacting, that he made her day, that in no way that it's cheating, accusing me of being controlling by not letting him draw girls (which i didn't even say at all) and that he didn't even know that she was going to post it on her story. even then i'm still just so upset at the fact that he sent it to her. like look, i wouldn't have cared if they were close buddies, but dude you only met her once. he even went as far as using pornstars' as an argument on how they separate work from their love lives; okay buddy your drawing is just a hobby like did you really have to pull that out. in conclusion, the fight was bad, but we eventually talked it out and he said he misunderstood me and won't ever do that again. the fight took a toll on me and made me question my trust for him a little, considering he was arguing how happy he made the other girl and that i was overreacting to begin with when he should've just understood how uncomfortable it made me. my insecurities and fears got the better of me and one weekend when he came to visit, i went through his phone while he was sleeping. and lo and behold, i found out he lied to me about not knowing she was going to post it because she explicitly asked for a better pic for her to post it, which he happily sent. and the conversation went kind of like this: him: hey! i saw your pic on insta and wanted to draw you 😊 her: oh my gosh!! this looks better than me, thanks so much!! can i have a better pic to post on insta? him: sure! and don't say that, it's you so of course you look good her: (heart emojis) thanks so much you made my day!! <3 i was pretty guilty snoopy and finding out he lied messed me up on top of my fear becoming true that she was going to be so sweet on him for the gesture. i told him what i did and what i found out. and ever since then the trust in our relationship took a blow and sometimes i catch myself wondering what else he's hid from me. with how the fight went down, and me resorting to what i did, i wonder if the trust can ever go back to the way it was. even though he forgives me for going through his phone and understanding why i did. he's aware of how much damage was done and tries to prove to me that he won't ever hide things me again and wants to regain my trust. things have been going fine ever since, but what happened still eats at me now. what should i do and can the trust ever go back to the way it once was? -thanks for reading!	0

sad boi hours 😔 i'm pretty sad, as i got left on read twice by the girl i like. i messaged her last week and we had a pretty good convo, that wasn't one sided. her responses were higher quality than mine, if anything. she left me on read three days ago. i followed up with "what's good?" two days ago and got left on read. she seems polite and her responses were good so why/ did i get ghosted? i responded pretty fast sometimes but other times i'd wait a few hours. maybe i was too needy? just would like anyone's opinion. thanks 😔	0
my thoughts on elite dangerous so far **big disclaimer:** i've only plaid the game for a bit, just over 30 hours (for this game, 30 hours is nothing), so i don't know everything about the game, but i do know enough. in this post i don't wish to bash on the game, but there will be a lot of negativity, i hope it will come out from the post itself, but i'm only trying to point out some flaws in the game that i wish weren't there, because i love what this game *could be*. also i kinda feel like no one will read this massive wall of text, but i enjoy writing it! # the sandbox elite dangerous is a *pseudo-sandbox* space sim, and i'm fairly confident in using that term: "pseudo-sandbox", first of all let's look over a definition of a sandbox game (i wouldn't say there is a "the definition" and this is close enough): > **a sandbox** is a style of game in which minimal character limitations are placed on the gamer, allowing the gamer to roam and change a virtual world at will. in contrast to a progression-style game, a sandbox game emphasizes roaming and allows a gamer to select tasks. and that is quite apparent, you have no goal, no destination, no objective, no *real* story, you are not pushed in any direction and nothing is imposed on you. all you do is because you chose to do it yourself, any direction you take, and all your actions are yours and the game *for the most part* facilitates this. now, why would **i** call it a *"pseudo-sandbox"*, it passes the test, does it not? to this i say *"not quite"*. it does let you do anything you want, but there's not that much to do. i suppose you could simply call it a very shallow sandbox, but i feel it doesn't truly capture what a sandbox is: it's a way to sculpt the game into whatever you want (given some limitations, of course), but here all you can *actually* do is get the next ship, the next module, everything else is meaningless. a sand box with no sand, is just a box. # the lack of instructions i think minecraft started this, or at the very least made it popular; you see, minecraft is what lego used to be: building blocks that let your imagination go wild; these days lego's more of a kit for "build your own promotional material"™️. however i don't know how much that helps the game, sure eve is similar, but eve is a mmo (a real one) with player help chat and corporations (guilds), it can get away with this. you are simply thrown into the world and told to fend for yourself, which is not that bad actually; discovering something new, that no one has told you before, something that your friends don't know yet is a great feeling, one that is not that available in most games. but this also falls a bit short: there isn't really all that much to learn, and even the little that is there, is very badly explained, understood and shown. without someone telling you that scanners work off of thermal signature, that the thermal signature that you see is not the one that the others see (even if they are closely linked), once you "go silent" you stock thermal energy, and now you have no idea what your signature is, since like i said, the exterior thermal is different than the interior, and even though they are usually linked, storing it inside now breaks that link, or at least changes the formula, but you have nod idea how effective you are. and there is more, the movement is not explained at all (disabling auto correct, roll, weapon groups, heat sync, scanner, weapons don't show up in the ui part that tells you what is impeeding you from going into supercruise, etc). **my conclusion:** there is hiding parts of your game and letting players explore for themselves and there is bad ui and a lack of a tutorial, ed suffers from the latter. which brings me to my next point. # the interface is an obstacle, by design you may not agree with my last point, maybe you want to discover everything yourself, makes you feel good about yourself - i totally understand that, but that's one thing, this is another. the interface is your way of communicating with the game, it's what lets you do anything; hiding stuff is ok, actively impeding you is not. ### let me try and illustrate my point with an example: i'll even skip the part where nothing is explained, 30+ hours in i'm still finding new stuff (that would have been very useful in the past, this is not some fun little easter-egg ). trading is a pain in the ass, and it's because of the interface. i understand they don't want to make the game obvious, glance at the map, find the best route, never explore, but what they did to solve this, is frustrating to say the least. you can't see from the galaxy map what systems produce what exactly, or what they need, all you can see is the type of system (industrial, high tech, agricultural, etc) and there are known lists of what each system produces and what it wants. however, not all systems are made equal, not all produce / want the same things in the same quantities. all of this is not only fine, it's damn near perfect, but things aren't what they seem. when you look at each station in part, they don't really tell you much, they give you 3-4 things they want, and 3-4 things they sell, but those are not necessarily the best, and they are definitely not everything, in the end you have to go there and check the market yourself, this defeats the whole purpose of the map in the first place. sure you can make educated guesses about the local situation, but that's all you can, guess. this however is not the worse offender. once you do get there, no data is saved what so ever unless you screenshot the market place. you can't see what they have, in what quantities and at what price, not even after you visited it, not even an out of date version. this is the very definition of the classic excuse "it's not a bug, it's a feature". this has no point other than to waste your time, and this game is full of that. ### what the ui does more often than not it gets in your way, slow you down. it's either very bad design or very good design. i think it's the latter and let me explain why: the game is designed to waste your time, keep you playing so that they can drip feed you paid content, which brings me to my next point. but before that, one small point i hear being made is that if the interface told you everything, the game would have no depth (hah), eve tells you the prices for the entire region (10-20-30? jumps away), you can check prices with players in chat, and it works way better than ed. # artificial game lengthening the game is quite shallow and arguably short: once you explore an hour, shoot stuff for another 2-3 hours, trade 2-3 hours and do some missions, dockings, a smuggling job with some stealth mechanics (though badly implemented on the ui side of things, i love the stealth mechanics in the game), the game is done, you've seen all there is to it. buying a new ship only vaguely changes anything, superficially would be how i'd best describe it. in short there's no real point to it. but this game was not designed, it was not built for a "buy once, play it for a bit and be done with it", it has mandatory online even though that makes no real sense when you can "soloplay". it was designed to sell you dlc & expansions. to that end it keeps you farming for marginal profit with ever increasing ship prices and tedious gameplay to keep you either hooked or just busy so you are still here when the next big *paid* thing comes around. # quality of life or the lack of it. like i said, everything is obtuse and gets in your way, for no real reason. take travel: when you reach a new system (which is almost instantaneous, the inter system travel mechanic is quite good imho), you have to get places, but those places can be quite far away, several minutes, some over 10 minutes of doing nothing but going in a strait line, at least euro truck simulator has on/off ramps and curves. the game does not help you in many regards, it would rather waste your time, it disrespects it is, again, the most accurate way i can put it. # admission some of these things may be due to gameplay reasons, but then the game is badly designed. # the utter lack of depth there is no way i can get past this without comparing the game to eve. elite dangerous solves many of eve's problems * ship controls (in flight controls) * fight enjoyment / mechanics (eve is just click stuff to death) * flight / travel (enjoyment, complexity) * immersion, etc but simply trades them for new ones * lack of scale * reduced ship types (larger, capital ships would require a complete overhaul) * control possibilities (drones, fighters, shooting multiple targets at once) but if that were all, i could live with that, however the true lack of depth comes later. i will continue with my eve comparison. ### eve online in eve, you mine resources, you haul them to a station where you can sell them, or you can refine them yourself. with these refined resources you can now build stuff, components, bits and pieces of stuff. you can build munitions and the very ships you and others fly. you can sell these to other players. you can build stations, refineries, you can claim space as your own, set up your own station and refinery (which you built or bought from some other player), refine rare resources, build bigger and better stuff, you can make outposts / colonize planets, take resources from them, haul them, sell them. the ships are quite complex in of themselves, highly customizable, completely changing what it does and how it does it. there are ships designed for specific roles like stealth bomber (huge guns on a small, stealthy ship), electronic countermeasure vessel (it makes the enemy miss / interupts weapons / weapon locks, etc), back ops ships designed to go deep behind enemy lines for reconnaissance, make a warp point and bring your friends behind enemy lines; there are support craft, and so on and so forth. i could go on for hours ### elite dangerous you can mine resources, but only to sell them. you can also refine them, to sell them at higher value. you don't build anything, you buy everything pre built. there is no real way of finding where these stuff is, unlike eve that has regional market places, you have to find the station by trial and error (with some informed guessing based on high tech stations with high populations, but there's no guarantee). it's obtuse, dumbed down, distinct lack of variaty / customization / etc. the ships you buy are badly priced compared with how much you make (artificial game lengthening) they are virtually the same, just numbers differ, a bit of handling, gun points, the form of the ship slightly impacts docking and undocking, but it's all completely superficial. there is no real team play, little to no interaction in team play, it's just shallow. nothing like eve (a game from what, 2007?) # my conclusion i know i haven't presented much of what's good in the game, but that's difficult, it's mostly a feeling, i feel like a pilot when playing ed, i feel like i'm on the frontier, like i'm alone, but not really alone, that i need to take care or i might get shot at. but that's hardly enough, i need more. * i need more ship customization, i need more marketplace variety, build my own components from the minerals i mined and refined myself, find systems that may want them more than others, sell them there, or maybe sell them to players. * i want to explore, but not at the price of making traveling, trading, using the map, navigation and basically everything else a nightmare. * i want to trade, but i want to make it fun by planning what i do. i want to study the map for an hour and see a great trade route plop up in my head based on concrete data, i don't want to go from *system type a* to *system type b* to *system type c* because a produces for b, b produces for c, and c produces for a, make a bunch of screenshots and hope i find good prices. i do like combat and smuggling as is, maybe give me an indicator of my external thermal footprint. if anyone reaches this point, please leave a comment :-)	0

i have a hard time making friends warning ⚠️ : longish and on mobile i don't understand why but since i was little i could always make a good impression, make people laugh, have common interests but past the first encounter even if i contact them again later i get ghosted. i usually start the conversation and keep it going as long as is appropriate depending on the situation. i had a couple in highschool but we lost touch. i feel like i'm lonely. my fiance is amazing and i love him but when he hangs out with his friends and sister i'm reminded that i don't have anyone else. i want friends that i can get my hair done with and come over and watch movies and show my art to and make food with/for. i want some people on my side at my wedding. i want friends at my birthday. i want them to recommend books and shows and movies to me. send me internet posts that remind them of me and give me opinions on outfits. (fiance is colorblind) i don't have a supportive family and my sister is 15 and i don't have cousins near my age.so it's not like i can just hang out with them when i feel this way. maybe i'm overreacting but i need advice	0

a hint for everyone, maybe.. [m] hello everybody, i want only to share part of my story as a help for all of you one year ago (i was 17 1/2 ) i was in your similar situations. i never try to kill myself but the idea of do it was in my mind, every day. i only want to say that during my worst period (from 13 to 18 y/o i never had a friend, never hang out with someone and no girlfriend), a year ago, i thinked i reached the limit. i felt very bad, every day, more and more. the only thing that i did, the only friend that comes me to mind was to ask a old friend to met up, alone in our cities to do drink something in a bar, like a "reunion". the thing of the reunion was only a cover-up to tell him everything. how i felt, what was wrong and what i thinked was wrong, etc seriously, i cry in front of him. outside a bar. (in my city i'm not well-see from teenagers of my generation. years ago someone tell the story that i was gay, when the thing was a bad thing. and the things go forward since today) i cried a lot, in public. nice girls passed by where we were. the waiters of the bar saw me. other people passing by the place see a little man crying for no reason. after a year (almost) i'm here. the idea of kill myself never left my head. but not hard like it was a year ago. i'm still hang out with this friend, sometimes. the things gone better, i started going out more often, also with classmates and not only with this friend. i mean, i'm an introvert, nerdy that don't like the today music, so i'm out of the today standard. and i've to say that the things aren't "gold and flowers everywhere", but the things turned a little bit in better. and it can go even better. so, in the end, i want to say: if you feel bad, ask an old friend to go out and say everything you want to say. cry if you have to do it. it ok to cry. maybe is a thing already listen but it's true: ask for help. not doctors, psychiatrists or other. an old friends, a simple man that knows you and that can hear you. only this. have a great day🇮🇹 (sorry for mistakes)	1

questions for you about you. i am thinking over some questions that may lead to some good introspection :) if you have any more you think are worth adding please let me know. i can always use more. 1- what can you always talk about? 2- what made your favorite teacher your favorite? 3- what kind of characters do you gravitate towards? 4- if you could share a meal with any one person alive, dead, or fictional who would it be? 5- if you gained a superpower given your personal traits what do you think it would be? **for example i have a knack for being able to go any where and just make friends and be apart of a group so after thinking it over i would probably have the power of shape shifting or something along those lines** 6- what would be the title of a book about you? 7- what do you wish you saw more of in the world? 8- how do you help make the people around you have a better day? 9- what do you do with your free time? 10- when you close your eyes and think of a happy or great time what is there? ____ thanks for reading 🐻	0
help be my friend's girlfriend 👉😎👉 you may ask, "whyyy do i need to be your friends fucking girlfriend" and you'd be right, he doesn't need you as a girlfriend, you need him as a boyfriend. let me explain. he's a witty person from my expert experience as his friend. he is willing to take charge and own to stuff when things get tough, he is a natural born leader from my experience and take charge of situations if needed be but if not he is a funny and chill guy. charismatic, yes, he is charismatic and loving enough for me to write this essay fucking praising him. he is an adventurer, his hobby is riding a mountain bike adventuring into the wilderness. even if he get lost his cool tempered and pragmatic mind allows him to solve problems step by step. did i also mentioned he is 6ft tall? 😏	0

'you look like you're having a seizure' back in hs (i ❤️ the 80's) i so desperately wanted to be a cheerleader. although i had zero ability or any clue how to actually become one, i practiced my moves constantly. i distinctly remember being in safeway with my mom and continuously flailing my arms and clapping my hands to some imagined cheer in my head. my poor beautiful mother just needed groceries and i'm not helping at all, as usual. finally she'd had enough and laughingly said 'you look like you're having a seizure' 😂 i stopped practicing in public but continued at home until i finally got a definite no from the squad (after an embarrassing display in front of my peers). flash forward to this week. i'm now working at wally world and love my job. i'm in florida so i see everything lol anyway i see this young teen/preteen boy doing some low key hand movements while dragging behind his mom and her gigantic shopping cart. i think to myself - boy i'm glad that stupid fortnight dance thing is finally over. when low and behold the kid finally breaks loose and does 'the dance'. that fortnight dance with the arms and legs, right in the dairy isle. i cover my mouth bc i'm laughing at the fact i just thought it was over and he did it right then. right there in front of everyone like i used to do. and what does his mom say? yes. she said it and i had to run and hide. 'you look like you're having a seizure' 😂😂 it was so funny and brought me right back to his same age and the same yet different obsession. it just cracked me up and really made me miss my mom. i've only been there a month and already have so many things to talk about. my son is sick of me so thanks for listening friends ❤️	0
why this 16 year old want to kill herselfmultiple reasons, but i'll start somewhere. one is that i've failed 6/10 gcses by certainty because i didn't go (i don't want to talk about why) and on results day my life and future is going to be shattered with a hammer. i am ashamed of myself beyond words, and there isn't another option for me next year, other than my school's sixth form. at least not one that involves education anyway (i've said that to a few teachers but they've never got what i was implying). i was one of the super smart kids. i am the biggest disappointment of my year grades-wise; highest benchmarks (six benchmark 8s) to lowest gcses (failing most). i never revised once in all the years. i've wasted my education and wasted everyone's time. i'm beyond what you call a disgrace. there is no college that will have me and i can't go to college. i struggle to make friends as it is. there's no way, college is all wrong for me. my sister is going to be getting good gcses. she's passed them all and is expecting a few 9s (a**). i'm the biggest disappointment everyone knows. i've let down everyone i know; my family, my teachers, my peers and everyone else. there is no happiness for me if i don't get into sixth form. you need 5 passes and i can get 4 at the max. i've thrown away my shot. especially as i'm very naturally intelligent, it's so embarrassing that i'll probably be getting a 2 or 3 in english. my sister is expecting a 9. i don't know how i'm going to react on results day when i open that envelope and my world comes crashing down. i will probably be in shock. i've ruined my future. what is there for someone who gets, say, 2 gcses. it's 2019. i also believe, especially as, as far as i know, my school's never had a suicide, if anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. it would have the biggest effect if it was me. i was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. the teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. the entire year hated me and almost everyone knew it. i was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for no reason. bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. i have been depressed for about the last 2 years. and i have very very few friends and no social life at all. having few friends slowly erodes your self-esteem, not that i had much left after being bullied and being the laughing stock of the year. i never did anything to the people who bullied me. i just burst into tears writing this. i didn't deserve a single second of the hell they gave me every day for 4 years 😭😭💔💔. if i killed myself, all those kids would think "she really did it" and would say "we drove her to this" and kids at neighbouring schools would say "you know (my name) who got picked on? she committed suicide" and "a girl from (my school) killed herself!" and "everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but no one ever stuck up for her because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking "oh it's (my name) so it's okay to treat her like shit and look down on her and tell her to kill herself" and now she's dead." no one really cares about me. or maybe they all care, just not enough. also if i kill myself before too long after i've left year 11, the school will sort of take responsibility and will put up a memorial (i should hope) and try to remember me and do memorial assemblies, etc. i do have bonds with some legend teachers though so that would be sad. i just hope to god for my own happiness/life they give me a sixth form place without the required grades because of 'exceptional circumstances'. i went to sixth form induction day and i love it. that day was an amazing day. it's something positive to look forward to - i'm so excited about it but it might not get to happen. if i'm going to end my own life at some point in my life, it should be in high school because they are the people who started the chain of events that will ruin my life (although the bullies should know they have done that already to me). if i do it as an adult, they probably wouldn't even know or would remember me as merely "someone from school" so it wouldn't have a good effect. however, if i did it while in school, all the people who hated/bullied/laughed at/teased me are in one place and you never know maybe they'll actually care about me or feel sorry for what they did when they know i ended my life. also if i do it in college or something (if i have to go there, god forbid), school wouldn't make a big deal out of it. i've just realised this sounds like i want to do it for attention but that's not it at all, it just sounds like that because i'm writing about what they would do if i was gone which is what i sometimes think about. also, i have caused 2 people i live with health problems. i gave my mum chronic fatigue, which meant she was out of work for 6 years, by being an incredibly stressful monster of a young child, and my sister has anxiety which she 100% blames on me. i am no good for anyone. i wish my mum didn't have twins and just had my twin sister and not me. i feel very sorry for them that they have to live with me. my mum called me "the most difficult child in the world to live with" and calls me disgusting so much i should start a tally. my twin sister said she is disgusted, embarrassed, horrified and ashamed to be related to me. i don't deserve anything. i'm a waste of oxygen. sorry this ended up longer than i thought. sorry for wasting your time and thank you for kindly reading xx p.s. it's 11am and i haven't slept yet and i haven't eaten since 8pm yesterday and yesterday i work up at 3pm so i skipped breakfast and lunch 😬 p.s.2. a bit about me: i love panic! at the disco, i love music in general, i love my cats, i love musical theatre.	1
i wore female clothes today... so i was home alone, i was bored on my pc, had nothing to played, and i thought i should go and wear my sister's clothes. and i did. i put on her one piece swimsuit. was it embarrassing? not really. i always wanted to become the opposite gender for a while now. i used to always want to grow out my hair and braid them. i've been announcing that i'm straight and i do like girls but i'm probably sexually confused and there *is* such thing as a lesbian transgender (mtf). so... yea... happy pride month! 🏳️‍🌈	0

struggling to answer "what makes you unique?" 🤔 this seems ridiculous but i've spent the past 20 minutes trying to find the answer to my journal prompt for the day! you'd think that for a 30year old young lady, i'd have an answer but wow! i'm drawing blanks!! a part of me thinks i'm trying to come up with the "perfect" answer because i'm kind of a perfectionist. oh well, i guess i have my day's food for thought! over to you.

why do old people hit their smart phones and tablets so *frickin'* hard??? my grandmother does it and i tell her not to, i say if you touch it lightly instead it's more likely to respond. but she doesn't listen. she just goes "yes" and she keeps doing it. and i see a lot of other old people do the same. wtf old people, why do you do this?? is it because you get less control over your wrists when you are old or do you simply not give a fuck?! 😤😤😤	0

i (32f) injured myself and can't exercise for over a week. my best friend (31f) won't wait for me to heal. this is so petty and trivial, i can't believe i'm even typing this, but here goes... so my best friend and i started exercising and trying to get in shape last month. we started running using the couch to 5k program. partway through week 5, i've sprained my ankle, went to the hospital to get it checked out and have been told by the nurse i need to rest, so no running, no clubbercise, zip. i'm pretty bummed out cos i'd started to get into the routine. she's going to continue without me and by the time i'm healed enough to run again she'll be at least a week ahead of me. it wouldn't be so bad but for the fact i hate running. if i wasn't doing it with her, i wouldn't be doing it at all, we motivate each other. she's doesn't really like running either. so she's determined to continue the program without me so she can continue to progress. i'm feeling a bit resentful cos i've spoken to her and asked if she would maybe repeat a week so i can catch up to her after my ankle is better, but she won't. its so tempting to pack it in, cos i ran once on my own, when she was busy, so we had to do it separately and i absolutely despised it. i don't expect her to take a week off from exercising altogether just because i'm out of the game, but if she hurt herself i would 100% be willing to repeat a week so she could catch up! how do i get over my feeling of resentment? it's not friendship-ruining, i just feel silly for feeling like this 😞 tl;dr: my exercise buddy won't wait a week for me to heal after injury. how can i get over the resentment i feel?	0
hate how im excited 4 school😾 also i keep thinking about this old dude i saw earlier when i was w my friend who kept staring and smiling at me,, like he walked saw me did a weird smile, didnt break eye contact went to open a door and kept staring at me w the same face then went inside and did the same thing bc i could see him thru the window my friend said he was probably just being nice haha lol😃	0
i(21f) feel neglected by my boyfriend(28m)...i cant tell if i'm overreacting me and my boyfriend have been together close to two years, we have lived together for a while and at the beginning of our relationship he seemed so happy and obsessed w me(in a good way). he always complimented me, would show me off, couldn't keep his hands off me, but he was also cheating during this time, as well as i struggled w micro-cheating. about 5 months in we both decided to put our past and mistakes behind us and move forward and do better. i love him so much and i've learned from my mistakes 100%. he's the guy i want to be with and the person i want to spend the rest of my life with. within the past 8 months i feel like he started neglecting me. i walked in and caught him multiple times jacking off to other women(clothed and that both me and him know). he would compare my body to others saying i'm not as curvy as other girls and it caused me to constantly not feel like i was good enough for him. after that i gained some weight and it fixed that in the sense of no longer making me feel unattractive but as for his jacking off i have no clue bc i no longer check his phone out of feeling like i was crossing a line and invading his privacy...but i have also realized i feel mistreated in other ways. i feel like i'm setting myself up to be hurt. whenever we fight, he doesn't even care to fix things, he just says that i'm being over dramatic and annoying. i still literally have to beg him to touch me or show me affection and whenever i bring it up to him he tells me he'll work on it but he never truly fixes anything and he hates talking about anything serious for more than 2 minutes. it's like my feelings and our relationship working are a joke. he swears he loves me and only me but i'm just having a hard time. i'm not sure what to do because i love this man so much, i would literally take a bullet for him 😰	0

final goodbye. ❤️ - b.r.thank you to everyone on this thread. not only have your posts given me a temporary amount of hope in the past, but also they made me feel less alone. don't ever give up. life will get easier as time passes for all of you. unfortunately after tonight, i won't be here anymore. this isn't me trying to get pity at all either. i just want to try & help people suffering before i go. it's been a long road. it's crazy how much i've changed the past couple years. i've had my highs & lows throughout my life, but the past couple years have been some of the worst i've ever experienced. i accept whatever the afterlife has to offer me, if there is one. i just cannot be here anymore. i've made my decision. after years of therapy, medication, and hospital admissions i've came to the conclusion that it won't get better for me. everyone of you here has potential and a purpose on this earth. don't ever give up. be nice to everyone, you never know what's going on in their minds. live everyday to the fullest. if you're in a dark place, it will pass eventually. you'll get through it. i'm so sorry💔 goodbye, see you again one day.	1

my (m20) girlfriend's (f20) parents (m/f 50ish) have hired me over the summer as an intern. this is my first job, i was stressed because i felt her mom was being strict, i told my girlfriend and now our relationship is on the verge of ending her parents own two companies and have some real estate and have hired me as an intern for all three businesses. it's a good job, i get paid better than any job i could have gotten elsewhere considering i have no experience, and i work from home twice a week. i've worked there for two weeks now. i made an error on the third day by sending some people staying in house a information for the stay in house b. the houses are close together and have similar info, but once i realized my error i sent them the corrected info with an apology, told my girlfriend's dad, and moved on. her mom got frustrated but according to what my girlfriend said, she wasn't really mad and knew i was learning. i apologized to her both through text and in person the next morning and things seemed fine. i've made a few other small errors that were fixed rather quickly and without consequence since. then yesterday, she asked me for a spreadsheet and i sent it to her and she sends me "😡 you did not include the listing name in the spreadsheet. how are the maids to know where to go??". i did include the names, she just had to scroll down which i told her. then, at the end of the day, she asked me to send her the time table, i misunderstood it and sent my total hours rather than just the hours for the week. she sent me the following; (my name) please take your time to review your work before sending it. in order for us to trust you, we would like to be sure that your work has no so many errors. you are loosing time and me too. please review your time card again. you didn't work 54 hours. i felt awful. i explained my misunderstanding, told her i understood now and wouldn't make the mistake again, and sent her the corrected one. my girlfriend is in europe for the summer and i texted her that i made another mistake and felt badly about it. this morning she called me and was telling me about how her mom was telling her "oh, (my name) messed up again and all he says is sorry sorry sorry etc" and she said i really need to step things up and do better. i already felt awful about it and i got audibly sad and she said why are you upset. i told her i'm honestly frustrated with your mom, i felt like she was being harsh and overly mean and it made me feel bad. she didn't take this well. not because i insulted her mom, although i guess she could be feeling that without saying it. here are some quotes from the ensuing text argument: her: i'm really upset with you. you're being a child. and i'm really worried about our future if this is how your gonna act everytime an employer is "mean to you" in other words strict and demanding. i want to be w someone that understands what it's like to work hard and take criticism constructively. not be a baby and and whine about it. i want to be with someone that learns from mistakes and doesn't make them over and over again. me: i'm just frustrated in general. i've never dealt with a boss let alone one who is my girlfriends mom. i'm terrified of doing anything wrong and terrified of her reaction and i know that i basically get her reaction twice because you get upset too. i know that the stakes are 4xx because it affects our relationship too. i'm trying to learn. i haven't made any of the same mistakes twice. i'll shut up about it and deal with it though. her: having a tough boss is literally the most normal thing that everyone goes through and u can't act like such a privileged brat to think that it can't happen to you. like god just suck it up. life is hard. deal with it (later) her: being frustrated is what a child does. what a man does is understand the mistakes being made and learn from it and get over it. me: okay. her: you're being a d**k [censoring is mine].talk to me when you want to be (my name). i don't want to copy it all. this kept up for a while. she called me a d**k a lot. eventually after she called me that enough, as well as a child, i said "i'm going to talk to you later. it's not okay for you to treat me like this, even if i say something stupid". she responded saying "don't bother. don't fucking text me." so i didn't. she's 8 hours ahead of me, so around 3:00pm my time, she texts me her: clearly you care a lot about this relationship. i guess it'll get easier each night not talking to you. don't bother texting tmw either. i texted her long messages about how i feel she's being overly mean and responding too harshly to what i did and made me feel awful and i don't feel like i should have to put up with that. she read everything but didn't respond. she woke up around 10:00 pm my time, and continued to not read my requests to talk about the problem. when she finally called she told me i was a completely awful person for what i did, and that she says the things she says because she loves me and wants me to get better. i said she doesn't need to call me a baby or question my manhood or call me a d**k. she says that's what you're being, and i want you to do better. this argument was mostly her telling me i'm awful for not talking to her and that she got home from work at 8:00 and while she was walking home a bunch of people honked at her and one person stopped their car to talk to her, but "did you care to check on me? no. you didn't.". she's saying i've gone too far this time and i'm not the man that she wants to marry any more. she says i'm dangerously close to losing her. i'm very sad and scared. i don't feel like i have anyone to talk to about this. i don't want to lose her. tl;dr: i just started working for my girlfriend's parents, i got frustrated with her mom and it turned into an argument about me dealing with tough bosses and tough situations, and now the relationship is in jeopardy. please help me.	0

am i [18f] being overly jealous and acting crazy? hey everyone. i've been dating this guy (also 18) for around 8 months now and we started officially dating yesterday. we've had some rough times but we talked and things got better. however at the start of this year i checked his instagram dms because i had seen that he was talking with his ex girlfriend and i thought i saw a weird message on his notification center from her. he was calling her pretty and hot, sending her heart and fire emojis and stuff and also told her "let's get back together? ❤️" so when i found those messages i was honestly devastated and i just started crying. we were at his grandma's house with a bunch of his family so i tried to not make a scene. i'm not sure if they noticed but he did later. when i talked with him about it he told me he was just joking and so was she. he said he didn't see anything wrong with it since he wasn't being serious. he called me crazy but later apologized and said he was sorry and that he wouldn't do it again. i was still very hurt because i had told him before about the nightmares i had about him talking with girls like that but he said he didn't remember and he didn't think it would bother me. i decided to forgive me because i though it could have been an honest mistake. we talked about it again later and he said he would block her but he didn't and liked a picture of her in a dressing room with a bathibg suit on. i talked to him about it and he said i was acting crazy checking her profile and that he thought he had blocked her but for some reason it didn't work. i let it go. some time later i asked him if he talked with any other girk like that and he said he didn't, but also told me to stop bringing the topic up because he had already said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again. i said okay. yesterday i checked his facebook messages because i didn't fully believe him. i know it was wrong but curiosity got me. i found a lot of chats with girls but only opened the ones with his ex and one with another girl. these were from around the 10th of december. the messages with the girl were similar to the ones he had with his ex on instagram, and he sent her a picture of him sitting in the toilet seat..? so i guess they were really just joking but it still bothered me, especially since he said he didn't talk with any other girl like that. i haven't told him anything about this yet. now, just a few hours ago he told me he would be going out to smoke weed a girl friend of his. i asked which friend since i know some of them and have no problem with them at all. he said he met her through instagram and they've been talking for a while. i replied "ohh" and that was it. he's probably with her right now. so... what's going on here? am i acting like a "crazy girlfriend" and being way too possessive and jealous? should i even be feeling so uncomfortable right now? i don't know what to think or do. please, please help me here, i have to work with him tomorrow the whole day and i'm just feeling really bad rn. any help is very appreciated! tl;dr: my bf was talking to his ex in a flirty way (imo) and i found out. he apologized and said he wouldn't do it again and also said that she was the only one he talked with like that, which wasn't true. now he's going out for a blunt with a girl friend he met through instagram. am i too jealous?	0

if your name starts with a p and you like steven universe and you stream and pokemon and oh my dont want this to be a dead giveaway aaaaaa it took me a while to sit down and start writing this and ranting late in the night in r/teenagers is probably not the best way to go shoulda done this in r/unsentletters but there's a higher chance of the person i'm writing this to seeing this....if that's what i want, do i!??? we met on reddit (i honestly forget your username well i think i remember but every time i search it up i get nsfw accounts 🗿) about a year ago! but i haven't talked to you in almost half a year. i think of you often. i dream of you. you're very much the last thought i fall asleep to. my first impression of you is something i so foolishly hold on to when i always knew it would never do me good. i can't help it i want your approval i want your affection. is it selfish....perhaps. whenever we talk i feel as if the distance between us mean nothing. yet i think that's why not of this worked. yet i couldn't reach you. i wanted to be enough so so bad. i'm really proud of us for trying to mend the friendship. it didn't work out and i don't expect it to again or that we will cross paths again and try to redo all of this. yet i still imagine every scenario with you. we can hold hands again in them. i would hold you again my chest when you cry. i could still wake up with you. i still love you. i hope you still love me too. i'm sorry it's cheesy, but they're my honest feelings. this felt good, thank you for the space r/teenagers.	0

life is going downhill so fastmy depression is getting worse, all my coping mechanisms are gone, covid-19 and all the isolation that comes with it is making everything worse, my gf is gone, i have a chance to kill myself now, etc etc. i see no reason to carry on, sure in a couple years i could make everything right again but that's so so so long. a month feels like a century, i cannot carry on for much longer. i feel very guilty because people care and i don't wanna hurt them but my sense of guilt is fading away as the depression gets stronger. maybe they'll carry on and heal? i hope so. i know the death of a love one hurts like hell but i really hope they live on and choose to be what i can't be. idfk, i'm worried but i'm sure they'll understand and forgive me and carry on. i suppose it doesn't matter, once i'm dead i can't feel anything including guilt or pain or anything. i'm sorry to rant u guys. i love u all ❤️ take care	1

why shouldn't i do it? tw:a lot of swearingwhy shouldn't i do it? what makes me the special fucking boy that would deserve to live? what have i done in my fucking shitty life that would make me deserve to live? i have no one.. literally. fucking. no one. it's like i was made to be lonely.. i want a friend that i can hug but that would be fucrking ridiculous right? who in. their. living. fucking. minds. would. want. to. be. friends. with. me? i know that i'll never get in relationship with anyone because.. that would be fucking insane.. people say that your life has only two main reasons.. to get married and have kids.. i'm sorry but that sounds fucking insane.. me? getting married? do you smoke? and have kids.. i don't even have to say anything about that.. everyday i'm getting closer and closer to doing it.. and one day hopefully i'll succeed.. i have train tracks like 500m from my house.. my dad has a double barrel in his closet.. we have a rope in the garage.. i have a higway like 2km from me.. there are so many options to choose from 😊	1
my teeth are messed up hey guys, i was just wondering if any of y'all have tried invisalign, the invisible braces. i'm 19 yo girl and my only issue is one of my very front teeth jutts out pretty far, i like to call it my can opener 😂😂. i had braces when i was young but failed on wearing the retainer so it came back, i don't really want the big clunky metal braces again so i really like the idea of the invisible braces. i'd like to be able to smile without feeling self conscious about it. if you tried it, did you like it and did it work?? also how much did it cost you? thanks!	0

what do you talk about with your friends? i don't have many friends but am trying to get out there and meet new people. i'm pretty good with small talk and getting to know someone and even having deeper convos with them, but what the hell do you talk about in normal day-to-day chats? i end up only ever inviting people out to events because it makes me less anxious if we have something to focus on (eg, climbing, board games). i'd like to be able to just go grab coffee or a drink with someone and have chats somewhere between small talk and deep convos. you know...medium talk 😐	0
why pursue help if i want nothing forever? i don't care if my family cares about me, my mother and father are assholes for bringing me here. i don't owe them shit. fuck them. they only deserve seeing my dead body. i don't care if they cry. like idiots they may pay for my funeral which i do not want. if they want to waste money just like how they waste me then that is fine. tired of getting up for school nor do i care about being a senior in high school. fuck humanity. fuck school because it is pure indoctrination. fuck college for demanding wasteful money for teaching you wasteful shit. free will does not exist. i was truly free when i wasn't born. fuck everyone equally. that is what i think. if only the govment allowed me to die from euthanasia and legalized it so i can be gone. no more slavery. no more oppression. true free will.

my girlfriend/mother of my child is extremely negative about anything and everything and i dont know what to do. so i have been with my girlfriend now for over 2 years and in this time have also had a beautiful girl who we both absolutely adore. recently however i feel completely trapped in a very strange relationship and i dont know what to do. when i first got with my girlfriend she had attitude behind her but it was never towards me. she would (and still does) get agitated by anything, if someone said something or done something very minute she didnt like she would have to let the whole world know how shes pissed off because of it. even tiny things like watching the tv and the remote falls to the floor it would be a massive deal where she would let out a massive sigh and would stomp around when picking it up, again, letting the world know she is annoyed. i'm a quite a chill guy, i always try and think positive and the majority of people who get to know me seem to be the same when they're around me which is cool. because of this i thought she might be the same and for a long time she was but then it changed. these little annoyances would also be aimed towards me and when i would bring it up to her she would deny it when it clearly was. going to places with her is an absolute chore at times. we go shopping and a place hasn't got the item she wanted? she will have a attitude on her for the majority of the day. people walking slow in front of her, majorly pissed off like someone's just attacked her or something. visiting places and sight seeing she isnt interested and has to make a point how it's all boring and pointless to her. she doesnt have many friends and tbh i can see why. a lot of them stopped talking to her, they never explained why but its obvious why. i have quite a lot of friends and due to past experiences i never bring her to anything. i have been on nights out with her where she has spoken to friends, some best friends, like absolute shit for no reason whatever. they haven't done anything wrong, chill like myself and they dont know what to say back so awkwardly play it off with humour. i get made to feel guilty now when i go out with friends because shes not included and doesnt get to do these things herself so its "not fair". we have a beautiful 9 month baby who absolutely adores me and i her. my girlfriend for the most is great with her and does a lot for her but then will sometimes speak to the baby like an adult. if the baby doesnt want to go to sleep my gf will get very angry with her and swear etc. if i chime in and tell her to calm down/stop swearing i get a ear load of abuse back and are made out that i havnt got a say in it because i'm not the one getting her to sleep/feeding/changing her at that time etc.. it's very weird. theres been time and time again where i have nearly walked and everytime she has begged me to come back and i have after a few hours. her father was and is in the army so at a young age (about 8) her and her younger brother where sent to a boarding school and she hated it. she was there till she was 16 which then she lived with her auntie and two cousins. her attitude was bad there as eventually her auntie made her dad tell her she needs to move out and find a flat which her dad would pay for. her mum and dad are nice and they separated recently, both living with other partners who both have teen children or children turning into teens. i think this makes it worse as she never got that same experience with her mum and dad which is why shes so hateful. i've offered countless support, and i get it thrown back in my face everytime. she says she will changed but never does. my family are starting to realise this as shes even been the same around them so the house we live in feels like so dark all the time as we all feel as though we are treading on egg shells. every day i fake happiness with her for the sake of the baby. i'm scared that if we split she will be twice as bad with the baby and then the baby will grow up with the same attitude etc. i also really like her family, her cousins are amazing and her brother is a great lad, because of them i've met new friends and as you can guess she didnt, i just dont know what happend down the line with her for her to be like this or maybe her natural personality. i just cant do this anymore, its eating at me every day. we share no common interests at all, i'm really into sport and all things nerdy. i could sit at home watching any type of film and she wont enjoy it, i would happily go out for drinks or visit places she wouldn't want to do that, there would be and has been a massive moan. dont get me wrong we do have a laugh sometimes, but it's nothing major. if we didn't have a child i would be gone, statistically children do better when parents arnt separated but honestly i think it would be worse for the little one uf we did stay together as i dont think the arguing we ever end. i used to keep quiet but i dont anymore, and i'm past caring for my gf. i dont love her romantically anymore, just love her in a wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her way. any thoughts? sorry for the huge amount of info. there would be more in all honesty but trying to not go too mental 😂. thanks.	0

he (m28) hasn't deleted me (f24) yet even though he has a gf (f25) he religiously views all my instagram stories (even the long ones) whenever i post something. he's stopped liking my pictures because he has a gf now. i know he reads my writing on my instagram stories because he ends up voting in the polls for things he agrees and disagrees on. anyways. we met once almost 2 years ago. every once in a while he'd want to hang out but wouldn't put much effort in and neither would i so we just never ended up meeting up ever again. we just wanted something casual. i knew he thought i was pretty cool but he ghosted me 2 years ago like 2 weeks after our first date since i to him seemed to want something more serious and he wasn't ready. he's definitely the handsome player type. anyways i dropped him cuz that was a dick move but then months later he followed me on instagram wanting to hang out, go to the beach, do thing etc. plans kept falling through cuz i was busy then he was busy etc. but he'd try at least every 2-3 months to see me again (very low effort though from how it was before our first date). anyways he got very close to this girl. literally a day before making her his gf and finding "the love of his life" (he's known and fucked this girl way before he knew me) he booty called me. it was the perfect segway because i broke my old phone and asked people to text me their names to my phone number. he quickly did that in hopes of a booty call. this is what the booty call looked like: hey cutie. its _______ btw. (inserted pic of himself) oh hey! how have you been? hope you're keeping warm. good just bbqing. i'm a bit cold do you have a cure for that? hmmmm warm yummy tea or activities that make you sweat 😜🤷🏼‍♀️ i could deff use some instructions if you're down ;) sorry i only fuck people i know well and vibe with, and i don't know you well. i'm sure you'll be able to find someone! have so much fun ☺️ i did thank you 😉 have fun cutie aaaayyy perfect 🤙you too babe. (lol what salty kind of person says "i did thanks" haha who says that to someone?!) **tl;dr**: since then he's constantly watching my stories. especially because he knows i have 3somes with this beautiful woman and there's a guy now that could have been him. my life is very casual right now because i don't want something serious. **why not delete me if you have a gf?** i'm not a person a gf would want their bf to be viewing their stories and posts.	0

i just want to die i'm so fucking tired of people telling me that i should hold on & things will get better. ive been waiting for things to get better for 7 years now & life just keeps getting harder & harder. honestly i do not want to be here no more the only time i'm happy is when i think about ending my life. i'd be better off dead. i've tried to seek help & i've told therapists that i'm suicidal & the response i get is " oh i'm sorry to hear that" like wtf. it's like no one cares until you actually die. i have no friends in the city i moved to & back home i have like 3 & they just ignore me or change the subject when so say that i'm depressed or suicidal. i feel so alone ... i am alone. i have no one, no family, no friends that check up on me. i have one sided friendships they don't msg me unless i msg them which makes me feel like they not interested in me at all. i hate my job. i thought i enjoyed working with children but now i think i don't. the baby i look after just cries all the time & nothing i do soothes her & it's starting to get to me😭 i just cant do this anymore.	1

i am 16 and i am going to kill myself when i can get a gun.i am going to kill myself when i get to army. i am 16 years old boy and everyday i have strong need to kill myself. this has been like this for about month now. before this, there was about 4 months without feeling depressed, because i started taking antidepressants at 2020 spring. before i started using antidepressants, i had same feeling like now, but there was more hatred(i hated everyone and i wanted hurt others). i have depression, which was diagnosed by my psychiatrist. there has been depression in my family, my great grandfather hung himself and my mom have severe depression. i have been bullied from class 1 to class 8, usually verbally, discriminated and sometimes pushing me. i have always been helping others and i've been always kind to everyone though i have only got shit back. now nobody bullies me, i have good friends and i don't want to hurt anyone, i want best for everyone but i wanna so bad die. my life is going well now but inside i am dying. i got month ago depressed because i had strong feeling that i need gf but now i have realized that even if i get gf, it doesn't change anything what i am feeling inside, so that doesn't help. when i get to army and i get gun there, i am gonna shoot my brains out and then i don't need to feel pain anymore. i wish everyone here good life.❤️🙏 i just wanted to share my thoughts here.	1

help! feeling wierd about my gf's guy friend who doesn't really know me and she hides his texts. ok so i'm quite new to posting on reddit. i am a m(30) gf (27) i have seen a couple red flags lately. i'm not sure how to best approach the situation. long story short, she mountain bikes with a few guys in town. i woke up this morning flipped open her computer to start watching the motogp highlights. but the first image on the screen was a text conversation between her and one of the guys she mountain bikes with - "steve" ( my girlfriend links her texts messages to her computer ) i am probably going to get hate for snooping. so i'm going to say who cares and second can we all just agree if a message pops up about your so and a "friend " you're going to read it. the text read as follows and the time is important because i find it strange to make plans to meet up with someone late at night that's not your bf. 9:45pm her: i'm going to go to a friends right now for a little bit for a fire. not sure how long i will be. steve: okie dokie i'm in the area too. sick have a good time 😊 . let me know if you want to meet up after 11:45 pm her: hey i'm just leaving now i think i am going to head home haha i didn't realise how late it was steve: haha ya i just got out of the shower and i'm.... that was all i saw . i did not want to scroll and snoop her messages. so i started watching the motogp highlights and a message alert came in this morning from steve saying good morning and asking how game of thrones was last night now i totally understand that there isn't much to read into here. however i have been noticing that he has been texting her quite a lot over the past 3ish days . and she seems to be tilting her phone from me or quickly erasing or minimizing the messages if i walk by. she has never really mentioned him to me before and i don't believe he knows about me. (he could but i doubt it) i am just getting a strange feeling in my gut about this guy and her. i trust nothing will happen, but it seems he is interested in her and she isn't really putting up the sorry i'm not available vibe. i also think it's weird to just meet up with a guy friend that isn't a super good friend late at night for no reason. or make plans too. tl;dr! i don't know if i am over thinking my gf's behaviour over text with other guys... and it's definetly not flirty. just seems off. thanks	0

girlfriend has been adding guys that buy her drinks at bars on snapchat and recently gave her number to another, that i know of so last night my gf and her bff went out for drinks as usual almost a weekly occurrence. i honestly never make a deal out of it i feel she needs to enjoy time by herself with her friends i've never been jealous because of it. she got home around 1:50am really drunk, she woke me up when she was climbing into bed. i told her i could tell she was really drunk and to not throw up on our bed. i asked why she got so hammer and she kept saying some guys kept buying them drink, which i don't care about if she doesn't follow through with anything(free drinks) lol. she then almost puked so she ran to the bathroom downstairs, since she kept telling me really happily that guys kept buying her drinks which she never really seems overly happy about i thought something was fishy. while she went to puke i looked at her phone and she had a text from a new no name number stating his name and 😉. this got to me so i asked if she ever gave her number out and she denied it so i kept asking until she told me she gave it out before and usually doesn't give it out just added them on snapchat, it really got to me. this whole day i got to work a 10 hour shift i couldn't focus on work and just kept thinking about it. i thought i was over reacting but now i feel cheated. she says she never talks to the dudes again but i don't trust her, a while back she cheated on me emotionally with another man. they would message daily and i read her messages, a lot were flirty and they talked about eventually meeting up this went on for months. i had asked her if she felt something for him and she said she did for a bit. mind you i was going through some deep depression and i wasn't the most emotional person so i told her if she stopped we could work it out. a year later and here we are. we have been together for close to 5 and a half years. i think by now she should know that this behavior is not acceptable. her bff happens to be my good friend and she is recently separated from her high school sweetheart of 6 years, she has been going out getting drunk and sleeping around. doing things she never got to do, that's not the case for my gf and we both have been through that already. what's really shitty is that i help her with everything i'm not macho at all i let her have her own life, i like having my own so i don't fight her on stuff that doesn't matter. i feel like she does stupid shit like this because she knows i trust her but to me there are boundaries she shouldn't cross that i thought were common sense. what do you all think? i feel lost like i know what to tell her but she has a way of making me feel bad for thinking this way. i feel like i'm not overreacting and that i should not be okay with what she's doing, at the same time i hate giving ultimatums. i don't want her to feel like she can't go out with her friend anymore but i don't feel like i could trust them either. tl;dr my girlfriend has been adding dudes that buy her drinks on snapchat and has recently given her number to one. i only found out because i saw the text. m26/ f23	0

dissociation ok so i'm going to tell my life story from the begining. so my mother had her first kid at 12 and had me by the age of 14 and eventually went on to have five more kids by the age of 21 and we were all takin away and sent for adoption. but before that my biological family had me up to the age of 4, and i was already messed up in the head because i was getting abused by my aunt because my mom got pregnant by her sister best friend and she was jealous and took it out on me. and on top of that my family would just let me cry as a baby for hours on end and i ended up getting an outtie belly button. the reason we were taking into custody by dcfs is because my aunts boyfriend smothered one of my sisters in front of me and my sister and i remember all of it. at the time i had no idea what was happening. but as time went on and i got older i put the peices together. but anyways my aunt dropped us off at dcfs and her and her husband went on the run. since then i had went through 6 foster homes before getting adopted. these are the things i remember happening ( i had to put shoes on this fat women cause she couldnt do it) (i remember drinking either pee or bleach and i kept throwing up and the adpoted agencies were called ) the people that adopted me fostered me and my sister cierra together at first and decided not to keep her cause they thought she had to many issues. when they were fostering me my supposed to be mom was abusing us. i had issues with peeing the bed and she thought i'd do it on purpose but i wasn't and would lie to her and tell her i didn't pee cause i was scared of her. anyways as time went on they adopted me and my two other sisters got adopted together. and the other people i was with adopted me and they would let us visit and play. my sisters would have makeup and jewelry and i wanted the same but my mom wouldn't let me. then my mom cancels the play dates and said she didn't want me seeing my sisters again. at that time i had no idea why....i was like still 4. her reason behind it was because every time i saw them i would come back and act worse. the family i was in they had 4 kids themselves then went ahead and adopted another black daughter like me so i wouldn't feel left out being the only black daughter (so they say). my adoptive dad also had another daughter when he was 17 by another women so she was considered my half sister. so in total i had 6 siblings which made 7 kids total. my three oldest sister ages are 38 25 20 and i'm 19 then 16 and two 14 year old. all girls and 1 boy is 14 and the black girl is 14. by the time i started school when i was five i was adopted and my name was changed to kalyn. i was so talkative in school and was always getting in trouble. i was a very outgoing kid who was always happy. and always saying smart shitt. i was cursing alot when they first adopted me at 4 and they would make me eat spoonfuls of soap and make me do it and id be crying. that was the kind of environment i was around i didn't know better. i would also make fun of there daughter who at the time was 6 and she was really fat. but they would say stuff about me ..because im guessing theyd never really been around a black person. i felt out of place and ill tell you why. so growing up i was a hyper kid. they saw it and couldn't handle it. by the time school was over they didn't think i was ready for first grade and held me back. in school i was talkative didnt listen and through tantrums. i never got any attention at home except negative attention when my mom was trying to help me with my homework. she would even at home belittle hit and pick because i was that bad to her. shed get frustrated while doing homework and so would i cause i just couldn't get it and she wasn't patient and would just hit scream and belittle me. by the time i was in 1st grade i was on medicine. i had adhd and take pills for it. i also had bipolar disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and compulsive disorder. they put me on all thus medicine when i started school to mellow me out. when i was taking the adhd pills it would make me not hungry and i wouldn't eat. and my mom would force me to eat and i would sit there for hours at the table crying because i just felt so stuff and couldn't eat. everything i did annoyed her. i did weird shitt as a kid. i'd talk to the tv. i sucked my thumb would walk on my tippy toes and she fixed all those except the thumb sucking i did that on my own. but anyways back to my too story i would throw my lunches away cause i wasn't hungry and tell them my mom wasn't caring for me cause she didn't give me lotion and stuff. so i got in trouble for that and she also had people in the school watching me to make sure i eat. when i was 6 i was sick and had to stay in my room all day watching winnie the pooh and i didn't wanna be up there so i started screaming and crying. i wasn't allowed to go downstairs at all. so she kept telling me to be quiet and i wouldn't and she finally came upstairs and started hitting and shaking me. she called the adopted agencies right in front of me and tried to get rid of me and they wouldn't take me. i was getting into sooo much trouble everyday and getting yelled at i started day dreaming a little bit in my head. i would play with my fingers when i got in trouble and was basically always doing something. i was a bad kid i even chewed up one of the wooden beds they had cause they used to send me to my room as a kid. and i continued to get in trouble in school. i made lots of friends in school it came naturally to me as a kid. im a gemini 😂. i had got so close to a group of girls in school that they were threatening to beat my adopted sister up cause i told them she would pick on me at home and when i'd react i'd get in trouble for it. so they were gone beat her up on the bus and ended getting in trouble for it and my mom got a call home and i was in trouble. by the time i was 7 i really just started shutting down and just living in fear cause everything i did was wrong. they kept changing my medicine cause they thought it needed to be stronger and wed have to drive places going to therapy. the medicine was so strong it'd have me so knocked out i was drooling during the day so the switched it again. this time my neck would just spazz turn itself and just get stuck and lock. they had to rush me to a hospital and i got a shot and it was fixed.by the time i was 7 i was lieing and stealing to. but i was stealing stupid shitt from the house. get caught and get in big trouble . ## not finished

i going to kill myself when i get the chance writing this up so the police will have a nice scoop to give to the press tomorrow when i'm dead. i've been reading through threads about suicide on reddit for a couple weeks so i could get an idea on how i'd like to go. i've suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my life. being stuck between divorced parents, bullied and isolated at school and having low self esteem, suicide is the only idea that gives me comfort. i've attempted twice already (got caught both times), so i think it's time to seal the deal. i feel like i'm not good enough and i never will be. i'm 18 years old and i hate my body and appearance on a daily basis. no one will ever love this body. because i'm going off to college, i put a financial strain on my parents and i'm caught between their arguments often. i owe my uni $450 bucks for housing and orientation that i can't pay. i barely have enough scholarships to cover tuition and i may not get anymore scholarships at all. i can't find a job. i'm so mentally destroyed that i honestly think i'll never be able to heal from it. i was in a children's hospital for 10 days in mid february and i'm right back to my old ways. i'll never be able to escape this mindset unless i take the easy way out. honestly, i can't remember a time when i was actually happy. my parents are too busy arguing about money to care. my classmates are celebrating the end of senior year without me because they all hate me. everyone in this fucking town hates me, so why not disappear forever, hopefully tomorrow around this time?? my mom hides all our medications in a box in her room. when she leaves to run errands tomorrow, i'm gonna swipe some sleeping pills and my antidepressants and hopefully be gone early on easter sunday. if all else fails, i'll pull a hannah baker and slit my wrists. my older sister told me i was the problem child. i think it's about time the problem was solved. ✌🏾	1
i made someone laugh today 😊 i finished working out and was in the process of changing into my swim stuff to sit in the hot tub. pulling my duffle bag out of the locker i noticed my hat was on my basketball and looked like a head. there was a person next to me and i quickly and neatly pulled out my spalding basketball and asked "would you like to meet my friend, spalding?" the hat was on the basketball making it look like it was wearing it. he gave out a little chuckle/laugh. felt good i could lighten someone's mood at least once with my dumb joke.	0
the pain never ends. it's been 4 years since this sadness in me has started. i end every day by laying in bed alone thinking how lonely i am and how pointless my life is. it's a never ending pain that i just want to stop. i dont think it will go away ever.. crying dulls the pain but i cant even have that. i try to get the tears out but nothing will come. all these sleepless nights get so lonely. having no one to talk to is torture. music doesnt help any more. self harm is getting harder to hide. i'm alone. these scars on my body just remind me.. i'm stuck. not a day goes by without suicide on my mind. i'm to chicken to do it but i like to think that one day i'll do it. one day i'll be gone and leave this pain behind. one day... i wont be in pain anymore.. 😞 "shorty dont know i'm broken inside wanna be six feet under fuck being alive"-bad dream.	1
i'm not suicidal, but this is something i've always wanted to say to anyone who has felt that way. and i mean it in all sincerity.i love you. i've in all likelyhood never met you, but that is okay - i still love you. how could i not love you? it's not as if you've ever done me wrong... and even if you somehow had, i would still love you. whatever you feel guilty about, it must truly be a burden on your soul to drive you to such extreme measures. and whatever it is, i forgive you. i've no reason not to. forgiveness is part of my spiritual conviction, part of my moral code, and part of my personality as a whole. but none of those are why i forgive you. i forgive you because it is *right*. and i forgive you because, in truth, i believe forgiveness is one of the most beautiful parts of our existence. it's a new start, a reset of trouble. in forgiveness, no one holds judgement. life is more than that. in forgiveness, you aren't at fault. it may be your life, but you're only the one who is living it. in forgiveness, you are free from bondage. love is the prevailing force behind it. so please, what i ask of you is to forgive yourself because *you can*. you can love yourself. you can go further. you are forgiven and i love you. ♥️	1
just how it isit's kinda fitting that the only reason i'm not dead is because of my own incompetence. attempt 1: gun was jammed and i had no clue. chickened out after it wouldn't shoot attempt 2: my hand was shaky as hell and i missed the shot to my own damn head. chickened out again attempt 3: i fucked up tying the noose🤦🏻‍♂️ i don't want to attempt again, but if i do, let me succeed ffs, this is pathetic, even if fitting.	1
just venting i guess i have very overwhelming parents (it's more of which my dad) i can't do anything i have no friends whatsoever because of them they tell me that i don't need friends. i need help i've tried talking to them i really have but they don't listen. my dad is the worst i can't speak to him if i disagree with his opinion i'm afraid he would beat me up along with excluding me even more. my dad can be nice at times. he brings me on holidays etc. but he is too overbearing and when he gets angry he legitimately scares me. he5 obviously does that when my mom is at work or when my older cousin isn't home (as my cousin would always try stop him) or my little sister. i'm conflicted because he is nice most of the time but i have no freedom no voice no nothing. i can't even have social media to contact my friends. (my parents dunno what reddit is) i've been living in total isolation for 2 months and i have fallen into my deep depression and have had a relapse in my eating habits (i had anorexia). i know my peers are having fun not inviting me to things and it kills me because i've opened up to them and told them how i feel but they have still forgotten me. it's just a rant really but like i couldn't bottle it in any more. thank you for listening 💖	0
wrote this whilst at a very low point; i'm really sad right now😐what is life but more pain to suffer? suffering in life is more than pain. my weakness drags me further and further down. the further down, the weaker i get. why should i continue to go on? when going on in itself is in question. no one to speak to, to loosen the hurt. i get angry, anger to hurt. when all i see is despise. in all of their eyes. hungry, oh so hungry. i can't wait to be hungry no more. already their eyes see me, askance how would they see me if they knew? my flaws and follies, they could subdue me with words, heavyset arms armed with my weakness the world continues, life is grey and colour the world over shines anew. they might gasp for a day or two at least then, as tears subside so does their caring and their memories, dim as my own light not quite as bright as the day i was born a sweet, sweet baby once loved, he feels it no longer if only he understood or knew what he'd been given could appreciate it just once or twice then everyone would know, but he cannot, and down i go into a pit of emotional pain i don't understand but you do	1
this is it...i'm using a throwaway account for this by the way i'm going to get straight to the point, basically everything is just too stressful and i feel just too empty. anyways i'm going to kill myself. no, i'm not going to call the stupid hotline and no i'm not doing it for attention. i'm doing it because it's the only way to stop feeling like this. i've already decided that i'm going to do it. if for some reason any of you are worried, don't be. you all had nothing to do with it i just don't have anywhere else to put this. i already wrote my note and everything. i did the last things that i wanted: the only things that make me happy. thank you for listening to all of this when you didn't have to.✌️	1
what's wrong with him(m20)? so the last week my guy friend has been, idk bitter/distant? we used to talk everyday, alot and he's always found it funny when i tell him about dates i go on, and he tells me about the latest tindergirl you know. and when some guy is mean to me he tells me that i am "so hot" and "fuck that guy". last time he called me good looking we joked and said like "are you proposing to me" and he was like "yeah shall we get married🤪" anyway last week we met up in a big city in our country with his friends(that i haven't met before) and went out for dinner. we were supposed to go swimming and then he said something like "showing me off as a trophy" lol but change of plans. it was awkward, and he know i am like that with new people. after that we talked for a few more days like usual. i went on a date that i would say went pretty well and i kept him updated. he was not as engaged in our conversations like he used to but whatever. a few days ago i asked for his opinion on a picture of me, and he said that i looked like i came straight out of a horror movie. ngl that hurt me and we haven't talked since. and i have posted that picture and asked for others opinions and they think i look beautiful and stunning. why would he tear me down like that all of a sudden? i want to be his friend but not if he's going to act like this tldr; guy friend that is always supportive changed after we went out with his friends and i later talked about some guy i went on a date with(we always talk about tinder boys and gals). asked for his opinion on a seemingly beautiful picture of me and he insulted me, when he always tells me that i am hot. we haven't talked since and that makes me sad.	0

tell me we'll be okay (tell me your okay) the nostalgia hits me the most at night. when the darkness of my room is the only witness to my thoughts and music makes emotions a bit easier. i miss them. or perhaps i miss past me. i miss our tight-knit group that was just misfit kids with nerdy interests. i miss the way i never needed to fill the silence or how there was no judgment when sharing something. i miss a shy smile and black locks. i miss a pair of big eyes and brow curls. but i know i'm longing for past selves who don't exist anymore. simple memories that always make want to build a time machine. we grew apart--it was bound to happen, right? ~~or... at least that's what i keep telling myself.~~ it is with all my heart that i hope you guys are good. that life hasn't been too harsh on you. perhaps you may think of me as cold, i wouldn't blame you, but please know that i still do care about the both of you. ~~please.~~ ☁️ i'm sorry for being such a fucking coward and never telling you guys this. or even giving you both a proper goodbye. forgive my strange ways and me. life is cruel... i'm cruel. and for both of those things i am sorry. perhaps my words always felt empty, but i hope that my actions were never that. ☁️ these tears leave the taste of the ocean on my lips, and my vision blurs. i hear your voices when i feel too old. ~~i shouldn't feel so old and weary of life when my body is still so young.~~ it's pathetic how the memories we made make me tear up. i'm so used to feeling so empty nowadays. ~~do you guys feel it too? i hope you don't. you both don't deserve that.~~ i'm not one to pray to god, but fucking shit do i do pray for you both. a silent request (demand) to that ever absent being to make your lives a bit less bleak. ☁️ thank you both, all the same, for giving me bittersweet memories i can store away. thank you both for laughter and friendship. thank you for a little piece of heaven on hell. even if it was bound to be temporary. most importantly, thank you for tears that remind me i'm still here. that i'm still--somehow--human.	0
i've always wanted to dance but i can't dance to save my life i think people that can dance are so cool lol, i especially love hip hop and bboy style dancing and watching choreo videos on youtube always makes me fantasize about what it would be like. girls that can dance are so sexy, guys that can dance are dripping with swag, plus a huge part of hip hop dancing is fashion, which also happens to be a huge part of my life lol. for now though i'm stuck with my daydreams of what it would be like to kill a choreo and have a crowd of my dance classmates go nuts 😅	0

usmc recruiters made me bawl my eyes out kinda embarrassing but here it goes, incoming gargantuan story some backstory, i've had a really tough life. i've always known that but i guess i'm somewhat desensitized from it since i've lived it. since i was in 4th grade i've had to fend for myself. i took care of myself, i was my own friend, therapist, partner, etc. my parents who were supposed to do that weren't dead. they didn't abandon me at some firehouse doorstep, etc. they were there but they weren't. they abused me mentally physically and emotionally. my dad watched this going on and never lifted a finger to stop it. during teacher parent conferences my mom would go in and tell them lies about how much of a horrible son i was. she'd say i would hit her, insult her etc. then to finish it up she'd start fake crying. as soon as she stepped out she'd wipe the tears off, clear her voice and act like nothing happened. point is, she turned everyone against me. i became severely obese throughout this. during freshmen year i started to change that though. i went from 250lbs to 159lbs while having my family criticize me for trying to lose weight. according to them i had "image issues" and bulimia. i then went and gained muscle. anyway, point is, i've always been alone. i've never had someone to hold my hand. when i was little and made stupid drawing i didn't have a mom to say "aww that's so cute!" or "good job!" instead i got "that's fucking stupid" and "for fucks sake what the fuck is that" and "you're useless". i never let that stop me though. i kept going without giving up. during school my grades were usually as and bs, k so now for the story. it's been 4 months since i started weightlifting with the ultimate goal to join the marines. i've been working my butt off every day in school and in the gym. this last tuesday i got tired of waiting (i was waiting for my high school diploma to come in) and just straight up called the recruiters office. we met later that day and i told him i wanted to enlist as soon as possible and ship out. when he asked "why the marines" i said "i dunno, just" after a while of him not dropping it and keeping on asking i finally told him i wanted to join to push myself physically and mentally. he then asked why i was in such a hurry to leave and i told him that ^^^ story and how it's getting unbearable to live here with my parents. after that we had a long long talk and at the end he asked "what's stopping you from joining" i said "nothing, if i could i'd ship out today " so he got on the paperwork. i needed my birth certificate but didn't have it since i sent it out to renew my passport. he told me he could get it by calling recruiters in washington (where i was born) etc. anyways, i've gone to so many recruiters before this and with them it had felt like they thought they were doing me a favor. with this guy it wasn't like that. and any other recruiter would've just told me to wait for the birth certificate to come in but this guy is constantly emailing and making calls to get it asap the next day he got me the picat test (asvab) so now we're just waiting on the birth certificate. that same day when i was about to leave he said (we were in a room) "before you leave sargent diego wants to talk to you" so he sat me down, asked my name and told me about how my recruiter has been on the washington's recruiters ass to send them the birth certificate asap. he asked about my plan and i told them originally i was going to finish community college then transfer to sac state and get a degree in psychology or nutrition but i did this instead since my parents were getting worse. he was like "what's your dream job?" and i'm like "atm? this" and he's like "no i mean, when you were little what did you dream about being?" and i said "well, i had my parents abusing me, i never had a childhood, i've dealt with depression, social anxiety, and selective mutism throughout my life. i never had time to think about kid things i just focused on surviving that day to make it to the next" and he was like "i see" so then we started talking about why i didn't enlist earlier and i told him about how i was fat af and couldn't even do 1/8th of a pull up. when i lost weight i realized i could join. so everything combined lead to a huge conversation about everything. the guy was also being so fucking nice (think my recruiter told him about my thing because he specifically wanted to talk to me even though we hadn't seen each other before) idk it was like someone had finally noticed all the work i've been doing to get where i am now. so at first i didn't think anything about it. i thanked them, walked out to my car, started the engine and drove away. i was driving to the highway and i started going up the ramp, the car was speeding up, it was getting closer to the top of the ramp. i merged and just burst out in tears. sooo.. a 22 min ride to my house was 3/4s of it spent crying.. literally for the first time in my life i didn't have to beg someone to do their job. i was just expecting to go in there and then doing their job. instead, they did their job and so much more. it didn't feel like they felt like they were doing me a favor. all the other recruiters had just treaded me as a number but these guys treated me as an actual person. they've put so much effort and done everything in their power to get me in as soon as possible. and they actually cared. i've never experienced that before 🤷‍♂️	0
painthe pain of being unloved and lonely is not measurable... my depression ruined my life i wanted to higher study but due to bad performance i couldn't make it... living a life i hardly deserve... just pain.... no one even out there to support me emotionally...just waiting for death to embrace me... can't bear the pain anymore.... people are so judgemental here on the web... i couldn't even share my feelings freely. someone out there always to judge me wrong... pain i just wanted some human support, care, love... 😭 😭 😭 emotionally exhausted and can't breathe	1

mamaaa my time has come... so it's the time of the year to become karma whore for the day, but don't worry i got a gift for you all.... a gift of personal experience. here are the tips which helped me during high school and they are still useful in college for me at least. 1) the secret to look cool in front of everyone is giving respect. the bad boy theme is sooo 90s. 2) all the boys and girls who think you are not good looking or pretty, it is just in your head. you look fucking amazing. just groom yourselves properly and see the magic yourself. you will be oozing out confidence like never before. 2.1) don't fell bad if you don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend, you will eventually get one. these things shouldn't be rushed. if you are making relationships just for the sake of having one, there is a huge chance that you won't be happy in the long run and might miss the chance to meet someone who is actually perfect for you. so just relax...and enjoy your single life also. 3) give respect to teachers who are nice to you and don't be a jerk to them, they also feel bad and have mental breakdown. for the bad teachers....show them hell. 4) never compare your wealth with other kids, it's not cool. 5) don't worry about your studies and do what you like the most. that doesn't mean to completely neglect your studies, try as hard as you can and if it still doesn't work then don't stress yourself too much. just have faith in yourself and you will definitely succeed. hope it helps to some of you 🥂 ps: sry for bad grammar.	0
i love being ignored 🤪🤪🤪🤘🏼 the guy i'm 'talking' to hasn't texted me all. day. he's been doing this for a couple days now, he won't answer me all day and then at like 1 am hell hmu and be like ' hi sorry i was doing something' like i understand being busy sometimes and not always being on your phone or whatever but i just find it really hard to believe a 16 year old guy is never on his phone throughout the whole entire day until like 12/1 am. idk it just makes me feel like shit tbh. anyways that's all thank you for listening to my ted talk	0

my (23f) girlfriend (24f), k, is sleeping with other women; i don't know how to ask her to stop, or even if i should. we have been together for over a year now and are very much in love and committed-- lately we've even touched on the subject of marriage, and i know that's where each of us wants this relationship to go. both of us are used to being non-monogamous (dating multiple people at once, sleeping with people other than the one(s) we're dating, etc.). we were both dating other women when we started seeing each other, but due to a few breakups and discussions about commitment we are only seeing each other now. really, though, throughout our relationship, i haven't been interested in anyone other than k and have even started feeling jealous irt her other flings. i've chalked this up to my feelings for her being much more intense and compromising than my feelings for past partners have been, and have pretty much forgotten my non-monogamous urges despite the surprise involved in losing them. meanwhile, k is active on hookup sites, and i've used them only idly since we've been together, declining to sleep with anyone. she is also the type to get crushes on friends and strangers easily, and she regularly flirts with these crushes and asks them out. when she meets/has sex with a new girl, i feel really anxious and insecure that she's moving on, forgetting me, or not serious about our relationship. i'm also worried about k meeting someone she likes enough to start dating-- i enjoy being her only committed partner, and have struggled in the past when she is dating someone else. she's very happy pursuing other people casually and open to any of these becoming serious, and i know she doesn't have any intention of hurting me. it's just something she needs. i don't want to prevent k from having her needs met, and i really want her to have everything she wants, but this hurts a lot for me. how can i ask her to give this up when it makes her happy? should/can i change my thinking somehow instead? tl/dr: committed relationship started out non-monogamous, but i've lost the desire to see other women while k hasn't. this makes me feel jealous and scared. is it too selfish to ask her to be exclusive when she's happy with other flames? thanks so much, reddit 😁	0

my boyfriend (22m) is mad because i(22f) don't want to have sex, but i'm sick. so my boyfriend of two years is mad because he's sexually frustrated and i'm sick and want to relax. we've had sex before when one of us wasn't feeling well, but it was either towards the end when we were pretty much over it, or we weren't that sick. i'm really sick. i don't mean to sound like a baby, but: - my nose won't stop running and i have to blow it every 5 minutes. - my throat doesn't hurt atm, but i keep getting that "tickle" feeling and then i have a 60 second coughing fit. - i have no appetite. - i can't taste anything. - i feel shitty. - i keep getting random body aches. i called out of work today because i just feet so unwell. i feel bad because we haven't had sex in like 5 days because we've been busy. two days ago i woke up with a mild sore throat. yesterday i work up with no sore throat, but everything else hit me. my boyfriend is all pissed off because i don't want to do it. i feel like i'm dying. and i just want to sleep and relax, but he's being a pain in the ass about it. and he won't leave it alone. i feel bad but i have no sex drive at the moment and i'm like wtf can you not. i feel like i should have sex with him, even if i'm going to be blowing my nose nonstop, and have a coughing every few minutes just to shut him up. 😑 tl;dr: i'm sick. my bf wants to fuck. i don't. he won't leave me alone about it. should i just suck it up and do it, so that'll he'll feel satisfied and will leave me alone about it?	0

why pursue help if i want nothing forever?i don't care if my family cares about me, my mother and father are assholes for bringing me here. i don't owe them shit. fuck them. they only deserve seeing my dead body. i don't care if they cry. like idiots they may pay for my funeral which i do not want. if they want to waste money just like how they waste me then that is fine. tired of getting up for school nor do i care about being a senior in high school. fuck humanity. fuck school because it is pure indoctrination. fuck college for demanding wasteful money for teaching you wasteful shit. free will does not exist. i was truly free when i wasn't born. fuck everyone equally. that is what i think. if only the govment allowed me to die from euthanasia and legalized it so i can be gone. no more slavery. no more oppression. true free will.

i don't know what game i should play next 😕 i've recently finished playing mass effect 3 for the third time now and i'm looking to find something else to play. but nothing has been really sticking out to me. i wouldn't mind going back and playing some old xbox 360 games, but nothing has really stuck out to me. what i really want is more mass effect and more borderlands. but both of those probably won't happen until like 2020. bl3 *may* come out q3 2019 but my money is on 2020. and after andromeda, who knows what will happen with mass effect. *sigh* i guess us mass effect fans are just like the people waiting for hl3 or firefly fans.	0

looking back at things. i used to be averse to looking at the past. i would push away mistakes and successes that i had and just look at the present and future. today is a great day for me to look back because i got the reminder that today is my cake day! i took a look back at my history here and man it felt so great. i was able to see where i have grown and the changes in how i think. i also got a chance to look back at all the amazing who joined me for even just a moment to share their perspective on things. all of the change i see in myself is really due to you. the people who read what i have and talk to me about it. it reminds me the importance to converse. i have been wrong plenty of times or assumed the wrong thing and luckily i had all of you to correct me. so here are some questions i am wondering about: do you look back on your life often? do you have a way to take a peak in your past self like a journal? how have you changed in the last four years? what do you think caused the biggest spur of changes for you in those years? do you have a story you want to share based on an experience you had? why does this story stick in your head? what has reddit given you? ____ thanks for reading over the years 🐻 p.s i am taking this time to also start writing on my reddit page. i try really hard to keep my own stuff out of here because i come to talk about you. so i am going to use that space to indulge in me. **so as a little side question what would you want to read there?**	0

anyone want to talk about their sos? finally found the right guy and it feels amazing sometimes you're just with someone you love so much you just wanna scream it to the world, you can gush all you want here! honestly in my case i'm so thankful for my boyfriend's existence. my mental illnesses had me feeling like i'd never be loved most of last year, and i guess you could call me a little weird (i'm autistic haha) but he makes me feel so loved and confident in myself, quirks and all! he's extremely supportive and does his best to understand which i always appreciate, he makes me laugh a looot, spending time with him has my heart doing backflips from being so overwhelmingly happy and he just makes it so obvious he really cares about me. i've found someone to be a total nerd with and i love it so much! sometimes it just feels like my heart will explode, but i really don't mind :') anyone else just wanna ramble about their someone? it feels so nice to be able to just say it all 😊	0
should i even bother trying to remain contact with my family anymore? (24f) sister (23f), father (46m) my father has always put my sister before me. buying her countless things meeting with her all of the time. he then complains about her too me. such as every year he gives her a bunch of money and takes her out to eat at a restaurant. this year she said she wants to go out with friends and will meet him after to pick up money. he messaged me crying that he did all of this stuff for her but she can't even meet with him. i just told him that sucks. for my bday he usually gives me 10 dollars if he doesn't forget and has never taken me out. i don't care too much about the material items, i'm more bothered about him coming straight to me to complain about her. i tried to get along with my sister. i would invite her out and she would agree and then last second say "oh yeah, i forgot we agreed to meet and i'm with my friends now lol." she has done this every single time. i just stopped inviting her and she has never invited me anywhere. the thing that hurts me most is she never texts me i always text her first and i texted her for her bday and apparently she got a new number and had posted on facebook the day before "the people that matter to me have my number." i thought it was the number i had saved but apparently not. my sister only texted me when her car broke down and she needed rides and when her bfs dump her and she needs somewhere to stay. my dad only texts me to complain about my sister. i tried talking to him and he always responds with lol,k,cool. should i ask for her number?🥺 small story: when we were around 17, i got picked up from school by my uncle for my b-day i was super excited and asked if my sister was coming he said no. when we got to restaurant my dad showed up for free food. i asked if he would pick up my sister and he said "no." and i said "why not?" and he said "cause it's your birthday" and i said "we should get my sister!" he then said "oh my god, we are not getting your sister. on her bday we took her out and you know how much she asked about you coming? never. she never brought you up once." i was sad and got a text from my sister she was on lunch and she said "is dad going to pick me up?" and i said "he said no." and she said " that's fucked up!" and then she said "i bet you didn't even ask them to get me,you stupid bitch." tl;dr: sister never wants to see me and gave everyone her new number except me. father treats sister better than me and then complains about her not appreciating him enough to me. slightly jealous of her getting all attention, mostly sad should i keep making an effort to talk to them? they don't try with me.	0

i will never understand you totally and you will never understand me too but...(serious post) i feel so done. i swear with all my heart i would love to found someone that can relate what i went through and with the same desire of just die together after so many longs deeps talks and weird experiences. to die in a special place and way. it's like a dream for me, to end this life at least togheter with someone, while crying in happy tears. please don't write "don't do it you will be loved ecc". it's just reality, i am sure it would be the best thing for me. i hope i will find you❤️ and i hope this post will be not deleted	1
taking a sleeping pill and jacking off [nsfw] this actually happened on wednesday night (technically early thursday morning though)... my job forces me to travel quite extensively, so i'm on the road about 5.5 months of the year, usually a week to 10 days at a time. bouncing between hotel room beds is quite challenging, but the hardest is re-acclimating to my own bed when i return home. almost every time i get home, i have the hardest time falling asleep! besides changing beds every 3-4 days, and then returning to my own bed is the fact that when i get home, i have to get used to sleeping with my wife beside me, so all the tossing and turning that i do on the road (i think i have undiagnosed restless leg syndrome), i am super conscious of when i return home, which makes falling asleep even harder! my wife is nearly 8 months pregnant, and this one hasn't been so smooth. not only have we had ups and downs of pregnancy stuff, but her sex drive has vanished. absolutely vanished, so we've had sex only a handful of times since the start of 2014. it's so bad that i tried to kiss her one night only to hear her utter the words, "i don't know why, but every time you touch me, i just want to slap you." i haven't tried to initiate sex since. i returned home from a trip on monday night and couldn't sleep, and since i couldn't get comfortable even after tossing and turning a lot, my wife woke up. in order to keep mama happy, i went and slept on the couch. i didn't sleep well, so the next day, i asked her to get me some z-quil. wednesday night, i got home at midnight and knew it might be hard for me to fall asleep, so i took the z-quil. 2am rolls around and i still can't sleep. my wife gets frustrated, and i get frustrated that i'm still up 2 hours later and i'm cursing the makers of z-quil at this point. i tell her that i'm going to sleep on the couch downstairs, when she reminds me that my in-laws are staying with us and when my father-in-law stays over, he usually sleeps on the couch. so i decide i'm going to sleep on the floor next to the bed... now that i'm on the floor, and no longer laying right next to her, i decide this is a good time to do what most guys do when they can't sleep: jack off. i do the deed and the wife is none-the-wiser to my self-pleasing. i'm about to close my eyes and try to fall asleep, when no more than 4 minutes later, she says to me "get back up here." i tell her, "no, i'm ok, you get some sleep." she says, "no, come back to bed." i ask her why. "because i want to have sex." oh, fuck! what did i just do??? i wrestled with telling her the truth, "hey honey, i'd love to have sex for the first time in months, but i just jacked off, so no thanks." but i quickly decided that there was no way that was going to happen. i couldn't turn down elusive pussy. instead, i manned up, and gave her a good pounding. all the while praying to god that my body, teeming with z-quil on zero sleep, after just jacking off 4 feet away from her, could manage to finish and cum. she might be 8 months pregnant and lacking a sex drive but man did she work it good, and after about 10 minutes of quad-tightening, muscle-flexing, and booty watching, i delivered! didn't take too long to fall asleep after that. ☺️ tl;dr: couldn't fall asleep even after taking a sleeping pill, jacked off on the floor next to the bed, pregnant wife who had been lacking a sex drive wanted to have sex, didn't tell her about just finishing jacking off, fucked her good anyway, came again, and then fell asleep.	0
17 year relationship ended by suicidemy life partner of 17 years lost his battle with depression 7 weeks ago. he hung himself in our garage and i found him. his depression has always been manageable with a few dark clouds here and there. i never saw this coming in a million years. 😔 we had a beautiful life together. my reason for posting in this thread is now i'm having similar feelings that i don't want to live anymore. i've done a bunch of research and there is a term for what i'm feeling called "widowhood effect". i am wanting to end my life but don't even know where to start. i have looked up a lot of different methods but the one that stands out most for me is inert gas asphyxiation with nitrogen (suicide bag) or charcoal burning. i hate that my life has come to this but i miss my partner too much to care anymore. i just want it all to end but don't know where to begin. sigh!	1

i really want to kill myself...i hope i die in my sleep.i can't stand it anymore. why exist?? we die anyway. am i even real? i don't even care anymore. i am afraid of what happens when and after we die, but it's inevitable anyway and i'm so fucking miserable all the time. i hope i come back as a happier person whose dreams become reality. i've decided to stop trying to get control over my health and just let my illness take me away, hopefully in my sleep... but i'm sure it will be slow and miserable, but i deserve torment, and besides, i won't even remember it once i'm dead... i really want to die so badly. i haven't cut myself in 3 years and i want to now so fucking badly. i hate my life. i have great things in it but i'm so sick all the time that none of that is enough to make living worth suffering. i want to kill myself!!! i wish i had fentanyl... that would be my ideal way to go, personally. ugh i feel so sick right now. please, take my life, god! i beg you! cure me or kill me, please!!!! i don't want to keep going any longer 😢 i can't keep going any longer.... i won't...	1
using maple syrup as lube so i'm a bisexual guy and have been with another guy for about a month now. we got all "horned up" before we went to bed and by the time we realized we were out of lube it was too late. he suggested spitting on it but i always thought that was gross, so i quickly got out of bed and rummaged around the house for something with good viscosity. i was a little drunk which is why i think i had the bright idea to use my microwavable maple syrup. "we could warm it up and add an extra spice to the moment," i giggled. this was a bad idea and here is why. so it all felt really great, quite magical actually, i'm thinking about trying to make my own lube with similar qualities to maple syrup. unfortunately there were some serious consequences. 1, the syrup has become way to sticky and my anus is pretty much glued shut. 2. i found ants in my toilet paper. 3. i am staring to cramp really bad and can't even push out a fart because my intestines won't open. jesus christ, i think i'm gonna die, i don't have health insurance and i don't want a hefty hospital bill. i'm scared, wtf do i do? i took a long shower (i don't have a bathtub) and that helped a little. mostly worried about the ants. any advice would be greatly appreciated. 🙁 tl;dr	0

are some people just not meant for love? i've never been in a relationship and i'm 20 and male in my last year of uni i'm ugly and not fat but kind of chubby, especially in the face area. i have really bad social anxiety and next to no social skills (if i last 5 messages on tinder without drawing a blank that's good for me 😂). i'm usually terribly socially awkward i also get really bad bouts of depression where i basically can't function like a normal person. i go through periods of apathy were im so lazy i can't be bothered to do anything at all. adding to this i have extremely low self esteem i really want to fall in love, it just doesn't seem realistic from where i'm standing. no one is looking for someone with all of the things i just mentioned. am i wrong? i need an honest answer because i can't decide wether or not to just leave finding someone for now also, anyone here in my situation, or used to be in my situation? tl;dr : can anyone really get into a ltr?	0

im feeling a year chronic depressed.already a year i feel nothing but hatred and sadness within fueling my thoughts with negativity. ive no hope in that ill ever trust people again or feel safe, loved or healed. feel happy. i never was a person to cry, but this year i feel like im constantly holding back and could cry every day if wanted on command. i feel fucked up in my head, with a desire to destroy and vanish. like all the greatness i once was is gone. ive felt fucked up often but only now it became so chronic and undeniable that i feel the need for someone to fix me before i make shit decisions but a professional would be too expensive right now and i cant put up a real person with my shit. im always about 'keep evolving', which often leads to me going on through my days denying my own insanity. but i dont know what to do. i feel constantly as an outcast with my thoughts and impossible to fit in. im either in a foggy fucked up negative spiral inside my head or ive a short outburst in happiness for a hour that drains all my energy. 😞😞😞😞	1
boy do i have a story to tell y'all ok, so my mom thought that i didn't have a lot of friends bc of the pandemic so she signed me up for this random zoom class for teens to talk to each other. the ''teacher'' of the class is a school therapist so she initiates the conversation in the beginning and keeps track of time. the first class was today. i join the zoom and see that there are only 4 other students in the class. i don't remember their names so i'll try to describe them. there was a tan boy, an african american boy, a caucasian girl with a bob, and a caucasian girl with a pixie cut and blue tips. so the hangout starts and we talk about random things, everyone asks me a lot of questions since i'm new but i don't mind the attention :) i appreciate a lot that they included me bc usually when i join a new class they all go and talk about inside jokes and are super clicky. about 15 minutes into the call the teacher says to tan boy ''do you want to take your 5 minutes?''. she explains to me that tan boy really really likes trains so they give tan boy 5 minutes to talk about trains since he doesn't like to talk about anything else. i underestimated how much tan boy likes trains bc he starts streaming himself playing a train game while talking about trains and playing train sounds. we all listen for 5 minutes until the teacher says that his time has passed. he stays for 15 more minutes in the call silently then leaves. the only time he talked was about the trains during his 5 minutes. when he leaves girl with a bob explains to me that they had to limit his train talk to 5 minutes bc before they did he would go on and on about trains for the full hour and no one else could talk about anything else. then the teacher asks african american boy if he wants to play a song for us today, he says yes. he's already at his keyboard and he plays an upbeat discoy song. he had changed some of the keys on his keyboard to play little catchphrases instead of notes so it sounded like a dj. i could tell that girl with a bob had a few social issues but that doesn't matter. she was really sweet and outgoing :) we keep chatting about random things and i talk to blue pixie cut girl a lot. she likes the same music as me and i think her personality is really neat. i've been looking for some friends that are girls because i'm a girl and all my friends are guys so i thought it would be nice to have someone to relate to. the teacher leaves the call because it's been an hour but me and african american boy and blue pixie cut girl stay in the call to chat. african american boy plays music in the background while i and blue pixie cut girl talk. she makes a comment that she's shy because she gets shy talking to pretty girls. i'm like aww thank you :). then she says that she's gay and asks me if i am. i say thank you but i'm straight. weirdly this isn't the first time a girl has hit on me and asked me if i was gay lol. then she asks me if i want to hear the song she wrote and i say yes. it was a romantic song and she replaced the name in the song with my name 😳i'm thinking to myself dang she's really putting on the moves for me xd overall i had a really good time. i could really relate to almost all the teens in the class in some way. the teacher brought up the topic of anxiety which is something i deal with and it turns out all of them do too. the group was so charming in a socially dysfunctional way :) they have planned a virtual prom and i'm very excited about it! bonus fun fact if you read this far: i accidentally burned myself with a curling wand today while doing my hair and now i have a scar in the shape of an egg 🥚	0
it's two years ago today. today it's two years ago since my friend committed suicide. she was 17 years old. it still feels so damn unreal, i miss her all the time and i hate the fact that she left like this. she had her whole life ahead of her, so much to do and see and feel. but all that disappeared, and so did she. what's left now is the memories, the family, the friends and the grief. that damn grief. it's hard as fuck, and tbh i think that it's going to keep on being hard as fuck for a very very long time for all of us that's left behind by her. i know how it is to be suicidal, i know how it is to feel worthless and i know how bad the thoughts can get. but i also know that it gets better, everything gets better. you just have to give it time, you just have to keep pushing forward. so if you're thinking about suicide, please think again. it's really not worth it, not even a little bit. you have so much ahead of you, life gets better, you're amazing, your life and dreams are valid, you will succeed no matter how hard it is. i believe in you 💛 [suicide hotlines (worldwide)](<url>)	0
my [m20] girlfriend [f19] was talking about other guys today was a big day drunk day at my school. my friends from home came up to my school and i was just really excited to spend the day with them and my girlfriend. something happened and my vibe was just killed. i went on my girlfriends phone and to look and send myself the pictures we took earlier, and when i swiped up to get out of the app, i saw her texts. she's in sorority first of all, and i used to be close friends with her roommate.roommate and my gf just kinda recently started bonding. i saw she had texted her roommate last night and this was the gist of it roommate- *name of frat's* party starts at 1 tomorrow gf- i lowkey wanna fuck half the guys in there roommate- who gf - shhh roommate-i'm not that close with op anymore don't worry then my gf names her top 3 guys, and says she would let the #1 guy spit on her. also, number one guy introduced himself to her and a mixer a few weeks ago, and that was "almost nutted" ( her way of saying orgasm) at this point, my entire vibe is just killed. eventually my girlfriend fell asleep and i wanted to see if there was more. i saw she was texting one of her sorority sisters and there was no mention of the introduction, but her sister ( who has a boyfriend) asked for that particular guys instagram and my gf replied with " look through my follow list 😛" they had a mixer with a different frat who's the bottom of the barrel in terms of popularity, and my gf said she felt like she was "wasting this outfit" and "why couldn't it be *the other frat*. my entire mood is killed. i suppose it's normal in a relationship to have crushes on other people, but i feel this is over the top. especially the outfit thing. where do i go from here. we've been dating since october 2017, she joined the sorority oct 2018. tldr- pretty much what the title says	0

i lashed out at a good friend and now i'm regretting it. what should i do? so basically as the title says, i lashed out at a friend at the gym and now i feel bad about it, especially since hes a good person. i'm 20 hes 22 both from oz a bit of backstory: this dude has never said anything bad to me and has always been nice. we arent gym buddies but we usually see each other in the gym. hes very helpful around the gym and as a person hes quite good too. i sometimes get annoyed when he talks to me when i have my bluetooth earpiece on so i thought my anger was justified. then i realized something this one day at the gym. its common, in fact most people talk to each other especially during rest between sets and this is what my friend did to me and now i realize how wrong and unfair i was when i lashed out. i became unreasonably pissed and i snapped at him and told him how i wish he would stop talking to me ever. that day he sent me a text saying how hes noticed how ive been in a bad mood lately, and if i need someone to talk to hed still be available, but he'll give me some space. i have not seen him since nor have i responded or texted him whatsoever. i feel so ashamed at how i reacted to someone as cool as him. at no point did he even cuss me out eventhough i'm sure he knew exactly how to destroy a person like me. i'm quite an insecure person with self esteem issues. i can't help but think nowadays whats going through his mind because of me. i'd text but i'm really not use to deep sentimental convos...communication isnt my strong point. even opening up in this post was difficult. i just wonder if he'd take me back as a friend tl;dr i lashed out and im regretting it edit: before some people message me saying my friend may have posted something similar here, i contacted the person on my other acc the other day actually and no, its not him haha 😂	0
got hit with the big sad™️to preface: don't worry about me! i have a meeting with my therapist in a couple hours and she and i will get it figured out! i just need to get this out of my head so i can stop obsessing over it! my seasonal depression hit me like a truck this morning, i had a really bad week last week that was extremely stressful and triggered a lot of ptsd but before that i was genuinely content and happy with my life for the first time ever??? for months??? it was so completely wild. i ended a couple toxic relationships, and made some really wonderful and loving new friends, and i live in a dream apartment and have a wonderful job that i regularly look forward to, i'm on medication that helps me get out of bed and function better than i ever have before, i have energy to work on projects and do things that make me happy?? and yet?? every so often i can't help but think about how much easier and how lovely it would be if i just died in my sleep. just a gentle fade to black. i don't really believe in a afterlife, so just dying? and then it's done and i can finally know peace? not have feelings, or worries or concerns? i just stop existing? i almost want to start self harming again just for the relief, the release of tension. seeing blood and knowing i'm real, having a scar to remember that i worked through it before. i've been clean for months but boy howdy do i miss it. i just want everything to stop	1

i have no idea what's going on but i want it to end.after my relationship ended a few weeks ago, i have plunged into the strangest and deepest of miseries. every *single* day i am constantly breaking down so hard that i completely soak my face in tears and end up vomiting, i cannot remember the last time i genuinely laughed at something, i am always harboring extreme self-loathing thoughts, i wake up wanting to kill myself and i go to sleep wanting to kill myself. i used to absolutely love my subject (mathematics) and now i have to force myself to even read a single page from a book, as i have no motivation to want to do anything. every moment feels like pure emotional suffering. i am always on the verge of tears, i am always begging for death. the funny thing is, i have no real reason for any of this. i don't even really think about my ex that much; the relationship was only 6-months long anyways and largely based on mutual lust. i think i'm just starved for physical affection, and that physical affection in the past has staved off my depression to manageable levels. perhaps, maybe my random plunge from manageable depressiveness into *severe* misery is merely coincidentally lined up with my relationship ending. i don't care. all i know is, i'm just a college student and i have not undergone any traumatic incidents since my abusive childhood. i have no real reason to complain; i mean, jesus, the other people on this board have had to go through divorces or dead relatives to get to where they were emotionally, and they're *still* stronger than i am. and yet, i feel like i'm trudging through the worst feelings i've ever had in my life. what the fuck is going on with me? i'll try to make the "right life decisions" (i already get good grades and have a decently sized social circle and have been attending therapy, but i'll also try to sleep at a reasonable hour, eat 3 meals a day, go to the gym, and drink a lot of water, all of which i haven't been doing as consistently). if that doesn't stop the breaking down and the sheer emotional pain soon, i am ending it. even though i would feel severe guilt over those my death would deeply hurt, this is just no way to live a life. i am non-functional. worse than just not being happy, i am constantly feeling as if i was just told my mother and brothers have died in a horrific car crash and, also, my wife of 10 years has been cheating on me with my best friend. and nothing of the sort has happened. i am objectively one of the luckiest people in the history of humanity. i am in a position where i can easily do the right thing (go to classes, do my homework, study for tests, eat my meals, exercise, and sleep before midnight), and that is all that is asked of me. i have no bills to pay and no mouths to feed. and yet, i am still completely and utterly *uselessly* miserable, and at such a young, fruitful age as well. how will i feel when i actually face hardship? i don't want to continue if i have no real reason to believe that i will feel better soon, or that this random sheer pain won't come up again later in my adult life at a completely random time. if always doing the right thing™️ does not change how insanely broken my brain chemistry is, then i am effectively like an incurable cancer patient and should reserve the right for euthanasia. in any case, i wrote this to vent, and to ask if there are other people that feel the same amount of sheer, sheer pain over fucking -nothing-. thank you for reading.	1

george r.r. martin's blog entry about the finale here's the entry copy/pasted because his blog is down, probably cracshed. an ending may 20, 2019 📷 the last night, the last show. after eight epic seasons, hbo's game of thrones series has come to an end. it is hard to believe it is over, if truth be told. the years have gone past in the blink of an eye. can it really have been more than a decade since my manager vince gerardis set up a meeting at the palm in la, and i sat down for the first time with david benioff and d.b. weiss for a lunch that lasted well past dinner? i asked them if they knew who jon snow's mother was. fortunately, they did. that was how it started. it ended last night. i had no clue, that afternoon at the palm, that i was about to embark on a journey that would change my life. i had optioned books and stories for television and film before. some had even been made there was no way to know that this one was going to be different, that this pilot would not only be shot, but would go on to become the most successful show in the history of hbo, win a record number of emmy awards, become the most popular (and most pirated) show in the world, and transform a group of talented but largely unknown actors into major celebrities and stars. even less did i imagine that i would somehow become a celebrity as well... and if truth be told, i'm still not sure how that happened. it has been a wild ride, to say the least. i want to thank people, but there are so many. there were forty-two cast members at the season eight premiere in new york city, and that wasn't even all of them. and the crew, though less visible than the cast, were no less important. we had some amazing people working on this show, as all those emmys bear witness. david & dan assembled a championship team. the directors were incredible as well. i should start naming names, but then i'd miss someone, there were so many. but i do need to mention david benioff, dan weiss, bryan cogman (the third head of the dragon, as i said in the recent vanity fair piece about him), and of course the great team at hbo, headed by richard plepler. any other network, and game of thrones would not have been what it became. most other networks, this series never gets made at all. i could go on and on... and have, as i've been writing this post in my head... but there's really too much to say. parting is such sweet sorrow, the bard wrote. in the weeks and months to come, i may post about some of my favorite moments from the making of this show... now and again, when i am feeling nostalgic... but just now, there are so many memories, and no time to do them all justice. let me say this much -- last night was an ending, but it was also a beginning. nobody is retiring any time soon. david and dan are going on to star wars and other projects beyond that. amazon scooped up bryan cogman, and put him to work on developing shows of his own, as well as helping out on their big tolkien project. our brilliant cast has scattered to the four winds, but you'll be seeing a lot of them in the years to come, in all manner of television shows and movies. our directors are keeping busy as well. i suspect that you have not seen the last of westeros on your television sets either, but i guess that all depends on how some of these successor shows turn out. and me? i'm still here, and i'm still busy. as a producer, i've got five shows in development at hbo (some having nothing whatsoever to do with the world of westeros), two at hulu, one on the history channel. i'm involved with a number of feature projects, some based upon my own stories and books, some on material created by others. there are these short films i am hoping to make, adaptations of classic stories by one of the most brilliant, quirky, and original writers our genre has ever produced. i've consulted on a video game out of japan. and then there's meow wolf... and i'm writing. winter is coming, i told you, long ago... and so it is. the winds of winter is very late, i know, i know, but it will be done. i won't say when, i've tried that before, only to burn you all and jinx myself... but i will finish it, and then will come a dream of spring. how will it all end? i hear people asking. the same ending as the show? different? well... yes. and no. and yes. and no. and yes. and no. and yes. i am working in a very different medium than david and dan, never forget. they had eight hours for this final season. i expect these last two books of mine will fill 3000 manuscript pages between them before i'm done... and if more pages and chapters and scenes are needed, i'll add them. and of course the butterfly effect will be at work as well; those of you who follow this not a blog will know that i've been talking about that since season one. there are characters who never made it onto the screen at all, and others who died in the show but still live in the books... so if nothing else, the readers will learn what happened to jeyne poole, lady stoneheart, penny and her pig, skahaz shavepate, arianne martell, darkstar, victarion greyjoy, ser garlan the gallant, aegon vi, and a myriad of other characters both great and small that viewers of the show never had the chance to meet. and yes, there will be unicorns... of a sort... book or show, which will be the "real" ending? it's a silly question. how many children did scarlett o'hara have? how about this? i'll write it. you read it. then everyone can make up their own mind, and argue about it on the internet.	0

every year i say i might do it but i still haven't & i don't know why some background on me: my mother's family who is middle eastern & very controlling love to watch my facebook account in the shadows.i am not facebook friends with any of these so-called relatives so these people literally have nothing to do but read my facebook posts.i made the mistake of friending a half-brother (ine time) & he messaged me so often i had to gently comment that it was too much.based on that,he unfriended me but i suspect either the half brother,my aunt (mother's sister) or someone else is talking trash to my mother which spurns her to call me.my extremely lonely pathetic mom who won't accept that she married a loser (my father) blames me (her only daughter & the only one out of her three kids who hasn't been to prison) for her empty life. so the reason why she can't get groceries......or go to the movies.......or be satisfied in life is all my fault. "why aren't you hear taking care of my every need........going with me everywhere......." is the message she sends me in every word she speaks. you see i have two younger brothers.........i am the oldest (daughter).the first son (a year younger than me) is currently doing 12 years in prison in a medium security prison in northern fl.he finally lost it back in 2009 & realized my parents are losers who have very destructive lives & will never own their own house,etc.he had a lot of trouble growing up & a family of five living off of $10,000/ye was made to fail. this is why republicans are wrong when they try to restrict abortion rights. they want to control women's bodies but once the baby is born.........that poor family can fuck themselves as far as vp mike pence is concerned. so back in 2009 the first brother after years of living without secure housing (if you've ever lived in section 8 housing......you know what i'm talking about),no healthy food (food stamps run out quick) or reliable transportation (no car)...... ........he took his gun he was hiding under his bed in my parents apartment,went out early one morning & robbed one of his friends then stole their car.he was picked up a few hours later & took a 12 year plea bargain.overly sensitive county judges (i suspect) in florida would've thrown the book at him with 20 years upstate because of fl 10/20/life "gun sentencing" guidelines.they were set up to criminalize minority families who lack access to social welfare & psychotherapy,i believe. the youngest brother learned from the older & turned into a little aggressive punk.he got a dui in 2017 but they went easy on him & charged him with reckless driving.this was after my mother tried to manipulate me into moving in with her by telling me he bought a cheap car off of his manager at work.😳my youngest brother essentially took over my parents apartment.my schizophrenic father hasn't physically touched my mother since 1994 (the year the youngest was born) & watches porn to pass the time he isn't working.my father has never worked which fed my current belief that work is for losers.back to the story........ over 2016 & 2017 my mother would call me complaining that the youngest (he was about 22-23 at the time) was beating her,robbing her & housing his girlfriend in the apartment (unauthorized tenant).i would ask her,ironically,why she broke her promise back in 2008 that she wouldn't get evicted again under similar circumstances.i was raised by liars & broken promises so i really don't care that she did it again. in october 2017 my mother,after years of physical & emotional abuse by both brothers.......fled her apartment,haphazardly cancelling her lease while complaining to this day that the landlord sued her in court for leaving the place filled with furniture & needing cleanup. again........she abandoned her apartment.........but its my fault because i wasn't there to suffer with her.how fucked up can someone be to wish misery on another? excuse my language but this is one dumb reason to lose your home. my father (black) due to segregation & tuberculosis in his youth eventually became an alcoholic & smoked heavily.somehow due to his eventual schizophrenia diagnosis (my current psychotherapist claims to not "believe" in schizophrenia/not a member of the apa) he was able to secure disability benefits & was okay with living off that. even better,while taking these super heavy psychotropic medications (i suspect) my father decided to conceive three children. for years my father has taken a medication called haloperidol which i believe is unsafe during pregnancy. am i accusing my father of taking this medication during the conception of a child? i suspect that it was accidental but many prescription drugs during pregnancy can cause serious problems,so............. anyway my mother was disabled & unable to work when she first came to this country so she married my father to stay in the country. thank goodness she became naturalized in 2015. shameful potus donald trump now wants to deport law-abiding green card holders & deny entrance to this country for people like my mother because they used programs section 8,wic,etc. now to why i'm in a bad mood: i would've posted this on facebook but my mother's controlling relatives overseas (my mother doesn't have internet access;also including one aunt living in north carolina) love reading my facebook posts then calling my mother & informing her that i am shaming the family.again........my mother does not have internet access so the only way she would have this knowledge if big mouth aunty (my mother's sister) didn't call my mom up & tell her to "control your daughter". whatever happened to free speech? i would post often about social justice issues like homelessness (which i have experienced myself due to being raised by animals). that "embarrasses" my arabic relatives overseas so the ones that have internet contact my mother & my mother suddenly believes that she is in the middle east & that i must be "disciplined". she will scream at me about facebook (which she doesn't know how to use.......),call me crazy & threaten me with many harsh words to demean me & put me in my place. so she calls me up & pretends to be concerned.......then she will say "what did you post on facebook"? i tell her (again,as a courtesy) that i posted about the lack of affordable housing in ca (usa) or homelessness to my artist friends on facebook. she explodes that i am an embarrassment to her......that i am a disgrace,mentally ill & when she gets the chance she will sic my aunt on me to get me in line. yes you heard me right.this woman thinks that she can control me like a piece of meat. i am 31 years old & my mother sees me as nothing more than an extension of herself. if i ever met a decent man then i will have to tell him that i have no family. if that future partner (i have never been in a relationship ironically because of the above family,etc) then chooses to leave me because of discovering my family's background.......then i guess that possible future partner isn't as forgiving as i would think. due to my upbringing i have become so selfish that i don't know how to be in a relationship with another human being.i don't know how to care about the thoughts of others.i am not an evil person......i have a good heart.when i say "selfish",i mean that i was constantly denied basic human dignity because of being in a poor family so today even though i am an adult,i have the maturity of a child,etc because i was constantly told "we cant do this.......we can't do that......we have no money" i grew to hate my family when i compared them to other families,growing up,thinking why "god" decided to punish me in this way. i consider myself an atheist. i haven't been struck down by lightning yet...... anyway,i cut them off years ago but my parents in their old age have no life so they sit around (my mother,mostly) thinking about what i'm doing. when i say that i have moved on (love you but can't be around you) my mother (who chose my father & his lifestyle) calls me heartless & hangs up to try to guilt trip/manipulate me. that sort of tactic only works on the weak. sometimes i think that true peace will only be had when she has passed away from age,etc. my father is not physically well & refused to buy life insurance. so when he dies she will call me up screaming that i'm not there to mourn the man who probably died watching porn,eating a baloney sandwich. a man.........that had me removed from my middle school sex ed class for one particular day because his religious cult (jehovah's witnesses) dont want girls to learn about the reproductive systems of the male & female bodies.they were showing a video in sex ed & he freaked out & signed a form to have me isolated for that day. my mother's suffering is her own. i do not subscribe to the belief that children are required to take care of their parents. its a nice thing to do......but if i can't do it or don't want to.......i am not evil. anyway.......in reference to the below passage,i would probably lose about 20 fake friends on facebook,be unfollowed & rejected.......then get a call from my mother screaming that she is embarassed. who is she embarrassed in front of? noone.......my mother has no family or friends because of her own life choices. she is angry at herself & looking for a scapegoat for her guilt. the other two sons are inaccessible to her (one is in prison but also because they are animals) so since i make the mistake of communicating with her.......i take the blame. my mother loves to call me the sick,crazy homeless girl (over the phone) while threatening to get family members to track me down here in ca to teach me a lesson........& also says if she had the money (she never will) that she will fly here,track me down & teach me to respect her.......😳 i tell her that if you are a married couple with only disability as income then maybe you shouldn't have had children & raised them in poverty. she has no response............................................................................................😳 below is the post that i must make here because my facebook account is being monitored by people so rich they can party in london & paris........but can't loan my mother money because they,like me,also believe that my mother should've never married my father.i often asked in the past why these so called "relatives" didn't step in to help during 2008 when we were evicted & were homeless for a month (we stayed in a cheap motel).we were evicted again that same year a few months later because of brother (currently in prison).again.........these people that call my mother up to tell her to correct my behavior refuse to help her financially. passage is below: cue super critical backstabbing relatives i've never met calling my mother to talk trash i love it when people who don't even know me......don't live with me........don't give a fuck about me........tell me that suicide is "morally" wrong because of their bible. if god was real,then why am i living in filth surrounded by homeless encampments while they continue to build luxury lofts in dtla (california)? whoever you are that wants to feed me false platitudes about "things get better"........i walk home alone every night down a dark alley with no streetlights. there are no streetlights because i live in a single room occupancy hotel in dtla (ca) that is subsidized by housing for health. i have chronic depression,hearing loss & was raised by a schizophrenic father & a physically disabled mother who isolated me,refused to let me go anywhere alone & lived off disability while criticizing the homeless for being bums. hypocrites. i live in skid row........& i see in front of my own eyes everyday that there is no god. i can pass by bel-air on the public bus & see the epitome of wealth. then every night i come home & pass the lowest of economic society. if there is a god.......then what the fuck is he doing while people are working 40 hours a week & still qualify for welfare??? how can you be happy........how can you look myself in the mirror while working yourself into a slow death at wal-mart 40 hours a week??? guess what.........i like art & theater........& i think we need more of that & less corporate welfare like donald trump's 2017 tax giveaway to the rich. i don't have a job & i live here rent free because depression,hearing loss & undiagnosed autism (i'm a woman) make it impossible to maintain stable employment. my county has a housing assistance program (not section 8) for people that were formerly homeless or make too little to afford the average apartment in la because there are too many homeless here & it was necessary. now before you get on my case.......i'm only 31 & have been denied disability multiple times in the last 2 years. any decent man on eharmony will only see me as a gold digger just looking for someone to take care of them. goodness help anyone that wants a man with a stable job,his own house,a reliable car & attractive. again,i walk home through homeless encampments every night because there are no streetlights on my street which is dangerous considering the many encampments that come very close to my building. every day i am in danger of being harassed,assaulted or worse by people who's biggest crime is being poor. if there is a god up there.......he is allowing this to happen. i can never respect such a being. i take the bus.......the only money i have i get from financial aid because of courses i take towards an aa degree in theater hoping to become sag & aea to better my life. but you don't give a damn about any of that. again.........noone walked home with me last night or any night because like that green day song said: i walk alone. my life is literally in my hands & anyone that would interfere with my choice or not to end my life is by definition........a fraud. i won't die today,but tomorrow & each day afterwards is different. because after you've saved my life........& the cameras/police have left the scene you will be gone & i will be left alone again. because its not about my life. it was never about my life. its about you propping yourself up as a hero & a "good christian". excuse my language but let me end my life when & how i choose. you can go back to your perfect life now. i have an intense fear of rejection so i will delete emails & voicemails without reading them.i am so depressed that.......honestly i don't bathe at all.i use baby wipes & that's it.my hair is too curly to manage so i wrap it in a silk scarf.it takes me longer than most to maintain acceptable personal hygiene.my mother never taught me how to take care of myself.she was still bathing me (yes,bathing me) at 18 years old.i get bored so i talk to myself when i'm alone.i'm 31 & i've never had a driver's license (only a permit but i've never driven except in driver's ed when i was 16).i've never travelled overseas.i've never been married & i've never had a boyfriend.i make lists in my head of attractive british/scottish/irish actors that would make the perfect husband.i have next to no job experience because my parents wouldn't let me go to work alone........or anywhere at all.i have no cooking skills & live off of frozen dinners & carbs like pasta that cook quickly.i share a kitchen with 40 people in this crackhouse hotel so many have a microwave out of necessity.i'm currently 200 lbs (slender body type) due to depression causing me not caring about anything at all.last week,i starting having these intense feelings of wanting to end it all.i still have these feelings today but i don't know why i just don't do it.these feelings dont feel wrong at all.i mean after everything i've described above,wouldn't you end it? i tell my therapist that i fantasize about a reliable working emotionally stable actor like taron egerton or michael fassbender being the perfect husband to take all my troubles away. he seems to either not take me seriously & suggests that i go on eharmony. i'm sure i will get many jerks on there pretending to be interested in me........only to say just kidding. its an automatic assumption that a woman with no job looking for a husband is a "gold digger". i don't care about impressing anyone but my therapist seems to not understand this. he is a nice guy but i feel that he is just joking with me or placating me. eharmony is expensive & won't close your account even if expired,in the hopes that you will renew. its summer & my community college is closed. i have a few months to lay in this room,in this bed & think about why i'm still here on this earth. i emailed my therapist & he told me to not email him anymore & just print it out.😔 you know how goldilocks says "not too hot,not too cold.....just right" over the oatmeal? i prefer for the weather to be a bit colder. i sweat excessively & nothing short of surgery to remove the glands will fix that.......or too much deodorant causing white marks. if i don't reply to you,please don't be offended. i don't even want to exist,therefore why would i reply to anyone here? i'm too distracted by the dangerous,severely mentally ill homeless crack addict who regularly stands in front of my building trying to break in. i live in fear somewhat that because of poverty i will be assaulted by someone for money,food......or no reason at all. i have a disabled bus card so worse comes to worse i can leave & just bum it out until i find a new place. there is no security here because it's subsidized housing for the formerly homeless too close to skid row. the police can't be trusted. just let me live inside my mind & fuck everything else. its not like my thoughts are bothering anyone. one of my favorite movies is "girl,interrupted". i'm sure you can see why.	1

it's been a year... it's been over a year since i posted about my "karma competition" with my girlfriend. little did i know i would be spending the rest of the year running, hiking, and driving with that person, enjoying the bittersweetness of her final year of high school before the inevitable start of college. thankfully, her university is nearby so we still get lots of time together. although i am "winning" in the karma competition, i've found there are things many times more important. i'll leave you to say spend more time with the people around you ❤️	0

know your fascists™️: redheads (a handy template) **disclaimer:** the views outlined in the following are *not* my views. they are intended to provide an ***educational***, see-through blueprint example of fascist ideologies in their many shapes, forms and variations. i do not have anything against people with red hair. some beloved blood-relatives of mine are redheads. in the following, people with red hair merely serve as an example of deliberate arbitrariness to illustrate a minority a fascist movement might typically single out to harrass and ultimately murder. --- " redheads i know, this isn't 'politically correct', but somone's got to have ***the courage*** to say it: **they are lazy.** take my other neighbors' daughter, for example: she's a redhead. when she entered elementary school, everything seemed fine at first: she socialized well with non-redhead children, her grades were good. but now, a few years into highschool, she's starting to show her true face: she's got a new 'boyfriend' every week, spiffs herself up like a tart, and her grades are hitting rock-bottom. her parents suspect she may be taking drugs. it's obvious this soon-to-be woman is going to finance her slutty gear, her drugs and her promiscuity, along with all its ramifications, through tax payers' money sooner than later! i'm not surprised. she's a redhead, after all. now, i know what some of you are going to say: * 'there are many decent redheads out there: skilled workers, successful business owners, lawyers, politicians, etc....' but doesn't this merely show how the redheads are slowly but steadily ***subverting our society?*** * taking away jobs that non-redheads could have had! * ruthlessly exploiting labor and markets for their greedy profit-making! * grabbing for positions of influence and power to re-shape and subjugate society to fit their own interests and agendas! we have to stop this! **we must put a stop to the redhead hydra!** just think of all the poor, non-redhead ***orphans*** we could feed through and provide with free education with all the wealth the redheads have been hoarding! think of what a relief it would be for our chronically strained social welfare system! think of how all those ***liberated resources*** would benefit our infrastructure and ultimately our economy! **every single non-redhead in this country would benefit!** and i mean... honestly? just look at them! you ***can*** tell a rotten apple by its blemishes! people say all men are created equal. but isn't it obvious that this is not the case? look at them! the difference is striking! you do not need a university degree to figure that out! orange-red hair? let's take a look at nature. ***nature is wise!*** nature tells us: when a species exhibits striking colors, that's either a) ***because it's poisonous/dangerous.*** b) ***because it tries to deceive/confuse other species.*** (mimicry) does this not tell us a lot about redheads? and then, look at their pale, pasty skin! one minute of sunlight, and they turn red as a lobster! does this look like a species to you that is fit for life? redheads have been cheating their way through under darwin's radar for too long! **it is time we put an end to it!** **non-redheads, let us cleanse and reclaim our proud nation!** "	0
is he serious about me? i've f[20] been seeing this guy m[31] for a few months. he's really handsome, friendly and so charming. we hooked up a few nights at his place. he has a big social media following because he's a successful dj and he's always on his lives. he always states that he's single when asked by a follower. i'm not bothered by this because we aren't together yet. i facetimed him one day and he answered while live and i told him that my dad asked me if i have a bf because i've been coming home late from (from his house). when i told him, he casually said "oh really?" and just to text him later so i could come over. his mom probably knows we hook up because i see her when i come inside. whenever i log onto his live videos i gush over him but there are like a lot of girls who fish over him too. like putting heart eyes and flirty emojis. a few weeks ago he got a message from his ex saying that he lied to her saying i am dating his friend and that she knows he's sleeping with me and that she's done with him. she really ripped into him and he said "i hope now you see why things are the way they are"......yesterday i logged on his live again and some girl said to him "the day you get a girlfriend , she's going to spoil you" so i commented "if she doesn't she's a fool" and he said "i don't want her to spoil me just spend time with me" .... idk how to feel about that response. he played some game with his followers and i won so i commented on the life "what's my prize" and he said "what do you want?" and i said "you 😉" and he said "oh me? ok" and i sent "😘😘" and he didn't say anything. how long does it take a guy to know if they want to date you. and his ex texted him yesterday but idk what she sent. i just know she's not blocked on his phone despite the fact he says he hates her.... does he like me? tl;dr sleeping with a guy who hasn't made me his gf yet. how long does it take them to know	0
yesterday i turned 25 and i still wonder how i made it this far.i was the only thing that held their marriage or some sort together. came to them today to have a family dinner tomorrow and they do nothing but arguing between each other over stupid shit. guess they are so tired of each other they ain't even faking it. yesterday i had a birthday party with my friends. of course it was great, but it was mainly an attempt for me to get some dopamine™️ through people i considered friends. we live together and i try to do shit that would bind me with them. simple stuff, like cooking a bit, doing common household chores around the kitchen and common places, going to the drugstore when someone's sick or stuff. but there's no feedback. when i ask them something about where is something like a bag for cold food (don't know how it's called, a bag where you put frozen stuff when going to the grocery store) no one batted an eye and helped me to find it. asked someone (by text) to get me instant ramen in store and them "whoops, sorry, guess i forgot". same with my work. i'm treated like an everyman when almost everyone constantly forgets about shit i ask them to do and rely on. i feel completely alone. not like *alone* but with no person i can rely to. my close ones make me sick. social interaction makes me sick. my work makes me sick. my constant struggle with my mental complications make me sick. my corrupted country makes me sick. the whole world makes me sick. and now there's some weird chinese virus which literally makes people sick. i consider myself a pussy when it comes to the suicide. but i already have two attempts. dunno when i'll get the impulse for a third one, but i hope i would be lucky this time.	1
it's time to go. i already picked a date. 20.01.2026. it's the same day i found out that the only person that i've ever loved, loves another one. when i was a child, other people always bullied me. family, friends, neighbors, strangers. fat, ugly, stupid. i don't remember my mom or dad ever hugged me with love. she passed away 3 years ago and i can't stop blaming myself. she always said that no one will ever love me. dad was.. he was there to yell and beat me whenever is needed (most of the time not needed). so did she. i started cutting and hitting myself when i was about 11 years old. no one noticed. few years later my parents found out. and again, yelled and beated me. i have 3 suicide attempts. the second one, my mom saw something is wrong but never said anything or did anything. the third time was recently. dad just went to sleep while i was vomiting out my life. funny, isn't it. i met him more than 7 years ago. i was really into him but he is older than me and had a girlfriend. we hooked one time and... it was the first time i enjoyed it.. the first time i'm doing because i wanted. it felt good. how stupid i was? he had a girlfriend. never texted him again. he somehow found me in instagram (end of september 2017) and we started texting. his girl moved in another country. we met in october and.. started dating.. it was so good. everything was nice.. except we had to do it in secret - he didn't broke up with his gf (i felt awful). eventually he broke up with her in april. everything started good. then he met her. she was just a friend.. :) and i was just stupid. the frustrating part is that i'm 20, he is 28, she is 16/17. :) he made me believe that.. maybe i do deserve to be happy. nobody ever stuck with me for more than 2 months. he was around for about a year.. i trusted him. nobody was that genuine with me before him. nobody every showed the slightest sign of love and affection. i fully trusted.. and then.. cold.. everyone else knew they were dating but not me. 😁 i'm so stupid. i'm so stupid for believing someone will love me, or fell for my ugly face. i made myself so easy to love. i was such a good girlfriend. i did everything, im telling you, everything to make him feel good - whatever he asked for.. but i guess it wasn't enough. i wasn't enough. i will never be good enough for someone to stay. it's always about the sex. it's always when they are lonely or looking for fun. always. my mom was right - no one will love me. not with this face. not with this body. not with this character. not with this mind. not with this baggage. why do i even try tho? fml i fail in everything, i couldn't even kill myself three times. i failed three times. i failed my school, couldn't get my degree. i'm trying to stay in lane but lately i have more suicide thoughts. i'm thinking again about drinking and cutting.. for now u just hit my head and somehow .. it's helping.. it really does! now, i don't want you to think he is a bad person. he is not. i am the one that failed him. i've lied to him few times and probably this is the reason he left me. i don't know. the funny part is that we are connected with something and i get to see them often ^^ we will travel in a week and i will have to see their happy faces and hear her laugh and see their kisses. maybe i will kill myself then? maybe few days around their wedding? or maybe i will wait patiently till 20.01.2026? i don't know either. i'm totally alone. no one to speak with. total isolation. i'm devastated. i write in my diary... my only friend.. eh, probably i've wastes your time as well. sorry! i'm just a waste of space and deserve zero happiness or whatever good stuff. the only thing i deserve is a shallow pit where i can die and bother no one. sorry for making you read this. hope i die anytime soon. tldr: depression; suicide; met someone; spent beautiful 1 year; they met "a friend"; i am a f mess again; talking how bad i am; prolly will kill myself anytime soon	1
she broke me i thought that life would have so much to offer. the truth is.. is that it does; yet my life is slowly coming to an end. opened pandoras box and was hit with forbidden love. because i fell in love with someone and this time it was real, i'd never felt the way i did when i met her. out of 19 years of seeing women, she was the only one to give me butterflies. that's when i knew it was love at first site. i told her and things didn't go well. mostly i think because we were under terms of the law " hippa." after multiple attempts to confess my love and get her to understand....she cut me completely out of her life. i was under the influence of denial. and then it hit me. it hit me so hard i thought i was going to die. i called her on my birthday, hoping that a sprint would be in my goodwill. but instead i got a short one sided convo, a "have a good life", and the. the phone hung up. my world went black and over the months, i lost both of my jobs, i became addicted to coke and alcohol. with that started the grieving process. except i grieved as if she had died, because that's the amount of loss i felt. after a year of hell, i still can't seem to let her go, no matter how hard or how many times. i know i can find other fish , but when you find "the one," where else are you suppose to look? and that is why i want to end my life, among a few other reasons. but this one ... this is the one. only she can save me, i need closure, i need to see her one last time. if i don't grasp her attention soon, then it's the end. i'm only 19 , i know i'm young you don't have to tell me. but people have to go sometimes. and that is why i'm sorry❤️ if anyone wants to reach out to her... let me know i'll send her info	1
again & again i am reminded that i am fundamentally incompatible with the world 🤣🤣 i dont have the ability or potential to become a functioning member of society lol laughs out loud thru the pain 🤸‍♀️	0
the spider-man countdown and belle delphine posting on ph happen on the same day... they said that "it's not what you would expect" for the spider-man countdown 😳😳 if you don't know what i'm talking about the marvel account posted a 4 in spiderwebs a couple days ago and the next day, a 3 and today a 2, so it's a countdown. belle delphine is an e-thot who said if a pic gets a million likes she'd post on ph and it did. today she posted a pic saying videos in 2 days.. coincidence? probably but hey, who knows.	0

don't want pity, just advice 🖤i'm a 17 year old girl from illinois and i've been struggling for a while now. there's not a ton in my life to cause this; my job is super stressful but i enjoy it, i have a mentally/verbally abusive stepfather and my mother is hyper-emotional which takes a toll but isn't it. i have good friends, a longterm boyfriend who's good to me (until recently but i'll get into it), i have things in life that keep me interested enough, but no matter what i just wanna end my life. i've tried everything i know to, i've been through therapy but my mom had me stop going and i'm too busy to start again now (but i'm too scared to tell anyone because the full extent of how i feel because i don't wanna be hospitalized or put on meds) the only person i've told is my boyfriend, and i only told him because he noticed me taking things out on him and being upset all the time and i felt bad. he freaked out and now we fight about everything all the time because he said it's "not fair" to him. i know it's a lot to put on someone, but i promise i'm not holding him back. i'm not planning on doing anything, but i can't get the thoughts out of my head and every reason to stay i've exhausted. yes i'm young and have life to live but who cares? haven't pet every dog? whatever. my parents would be sad? my mom just had another baby anyway, and my dad's so busy with good things in his life so i'm sure they'd move on. i just can't find any reason to stay anymore, and i'm so tired of trying to fix myself. it's been almost a year, i've tried everything i can think of, what can i do?	1

one of amazon's top 1000 reviewers just gave my book a 5 star rating. i don't think i've ever felt so validated in my life. it's 2:15am, and i should be asleep, but i'm sitting here with tears in my eyes because i matter. i've been writing for over ten years. i've dreamt of 'being a writer' for all this time, imagining but never actually thinking i'd amount to anything. even on good days when i knew my prose wasn't total shit, i thought- well, it isn't like anyone will notice me. i self-published in late march. it's been a month and a half.. i have a 4.5star average on amazon us, from 10 reviews. i sold my first copies to canada and austria today. i've sold almost 60 total. the top reviewer just became the first person on my mailing list. i'm a real writer. my motherfucking dream is actually coming true. by tomorrow evening i'll be done with all my finals and i can take the summer to write. i'll have book 2 out, and then i can work on 3, or the side-story, or another series and... if things keep going, even just as they are right now, i'm going to be able to do this as a job. it's unreal and amazing. because i was asked for links-- *(the story is 99cents/pence)* [amazon.com](<url>) [uk](<url>) [canada](<url>) [australia](<url>) it's also in continental europe and asia- just search whichever is 'your' amazon. it's **larkspur: a necromancer's romance by v. m. jaskiernia** >"pierre salvador, duc de piques, returns to court after an early graduation and attends a party in his honour that night. feeling unwell so shortly after his travels the princeling excuses himself from dancing-and-flirting with lady elizabeth anne, and retreats to his room with a black cat in tow. in addition to medical studies, pierre has almost finished the last task set by mora, lady of death, to complete his knowledge of necrocraeft. enthralled with the illegal magic, the power over life and death, he consorts with mora as he also begins to court elizabeth." and you can read the first scene [on wattpad](<url>) if you'd like, though admittedly it ends right before any of the fantasy stuff. [hi-res covers](<url>) - i photoshoped some paintings by henri fantin-latour- he did a lot of flowers and still-life, including the larkspur flower (also called delphinium, or consolida, depending on the type). [original painting the first cover is made from](<url>). a friend helped me out with the font so it didn't look as mspaint'ed on as it did before. larkspur is a flower that can mean first or ardent love, and it has also been used to ward away things that are evil/otherworldly. at the same time though it is toxic and can be fatal. there is a secondary meaning of being fickle as well. i've kept the meanings in mind, at times ironically, for the series. (can you tell i'm an english major yet? :) ) this particular series will be six books, i have covers for the first three made, and book ii will be out this summer. thank you everyone for your upvotes, comments, support-- especially the several of you that have bought the story. you've made my day, and it's a great great start to summer ❤️	0

i (m27) met a girl (f23) and things improved quickly, but now she wants to slow down a really good looking girl texted me in tinder a few days before christmas. i was actually thinking about texting her myself, but didn't feel confident enough. i actually swipe in tinder from time to time, but rarely text to girls and if i do, we don't get conversation going and never meet irl. this time it was all different, we got conversation running very smoothly (i'd call myself introvert and find it hard to talk to strangers). she was like a lot into me even though we hadn't met yet. a few days later, i arranged a date after the christmas. we had a nice dinner and quite long walk afterwards. i sent her to door and we had a little kiss, before going our own way. then she called me to her apartment to watch a movie. we slept together, but didn't have sex (she had that women thing, maybe we would otherwise). third date was in cinema and then ended up at her place again, but nothing still happened because of the same reason. she really looked in love to me already and i kind of started feeling the same way. first day into the new year, went to her place again, this time we bad sex, which wasn't really as good as i expected, both of us were like hurrying and not enjoying it too much (she wasn't really in too good mood that day, maybe that's why). two days later, she texted me that we should slow down and not hurry into relationship, because she is having some stressful times, bad mood, low self-esteem (which is true, she criticises her body way too much, even though she has some extra pounds compared to pictures from a year ago) etc. i texted answered that i understand and agree that we shouldn't hurry. but also said to her, that maybe that was because of that night, which didn't really go by the plan. she said, that sex wasn't really that bad and that's not a reason. she also told me that i am a very special guy and even if we won't end up together, she is really happy to have met me. and also asked that we should chill out on sunday again. btw we are chatting in messenger all the time, every day. but before that last night together, she was like sending me kiss emojis sometimes, now all she sends is hugging emoji, when wishing good night. i am actually feeling really in love with her already, because she looks exactly the kind of girl i like. i'm okay with slowing it all down, but my main worry is, that i don't want to get into friend-zone with her and don't really know, what to do in this situation. would like to get some honest feedback about what you people think about this.. is she taking me more as a friend now, or does she really just want to slow down, even if she has the romantic feelings towards me.. oh that was one hell of a long story 😁 tldr: i met a girl in tinder, she fell for me before we even dated. and so did i, kind of. things were really good after first 3 dates, but she wanted to slow down after our 4th date (first time we had sex).	0

am i defective? it seems like as a general population, the majority of people want to be alive. i don't. i don't see the point of being alive. if you're on here i'm sure you can relate, but i don't want anyone to relate. i've had a good childhood. a good life. i've had a good education. i've had so many people who've loved me. who've only wanted the best for me. but as much as i appreciate it i don't want it. i want to be excluded and unloved so i don't feel like i have any responsibility to be here. i just want to be able to let go. i don't understand why people feel such a need to keep others with them. if someone wants to leave they should be able to. i know what it feels like to have someone die. i see what it feels like to have someone you love go, but i also see that to exist is to suffer and if you're too weak to endure it you should be able to let go. i understand what it's like to have someone near you to commit suicide and while it does hurt i get it. i'm okay with it because if they were to live they'd be in pain. i'm happy they were able to free themselves of it. i just feel like if i want the same for myself i'm a defective human. healthy people shouldn't feel like this. but i don't care if what i'm feeling is normal or healthy. if i'm really defective it's better i get rid of myself now before i pass on my genes (which i'll say right now is a strong urge). it just hurts i've even had to exist in the first place. i'm not looking for answers this is just a rant. all my love to all of you 💗. not that that love changes anything.	1

i'm barely hanging on.unemployed for 7 months, and rejected from a job that i was 💯 qualified for with an inside connection. my partner lost his job. people say it's not my fault, we're in a pandemic. my ex best friend used me and tossed me aside, acting like i don't exist. life keeps getting worse. im barely staying afloat with bills. i left a toxic job so unemployment money is non existent. i'm a fuck up and a loser. i can't even get a minimum wage job. i'd rather be dead. the only thing keeping me here is my dog. i don't want him to be sad, but maybe he would be better off.	1

talking to my boyfriend about the morning after pill. tifu....so today i was talking to some of my co-workers about abortion. i won't even get into how that topic came up....but the conversation got a bit weird and there were a lot of different opinions about it. so, when i got home, i decided to tell my boyfriend all about it. when we started talking about what happened, he listened intently and seemed very understanding about my frustration with aspects of story. since we have pretty similar views about the topic, the conversation was going well. until the morning after pill was brought up. so let's preface this with the fact that we have a very active sex life and the sex is amazing! we do all the things to prevent an "oops" and neither of us desire to have a baby right now. with that said....he asked about a hypothetical situation where the condom broke or aliens inserted baby fluid into me while having sex. he asked me if i felt like the morning after pill was an option. and that's when it happened....i said i'd never take the morning after pill. 🤦🏻‍♀️ i should have known in the deafening silence that i had fucked up. but...no...i just kept going! in my defense (cause i definitely think i need some kind of defense 🤣) i had the complete wrong idea of what the morning after pill was and how it worked. i thought it ended a pregnancy not prevented it from happening. the next words he said included "stressed out" and "no control". that's when it hit me. tifu. now to try and dig myself out of this one. i start telling him my concept of what the pill does. yep. wrong again. so i quickly told him that obviously is had no idea what i was talking about and i needed to do some research. shockingly, he quickly agreed. at this point, several thing went through my head: 1) he's never going to let us have sex again! 2) why in the fuck do i talk about things that i don't understand? 3) he's never going to let us have sex again! so after my backpedaling (the fastest pedaling i have ever done) and my boyfriend recovered from his momentary meltdown my punishment was handed down. tl;dr: i'm officially on what he calls "dick detention" until further notice. i guess my tifu is gonna keep me "wanting" for awhile. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️	0

matching with hot model on tinder this happened yesterday. brace yourselfs - this is a long one. i was at work, enjoying my lunch break. just had finished eating a chicken wrap that my mum makes me,love you mum. ten minutes left in my lunch break, has been such a shitty day so far so i light up a joint and try to smoke it in the next ten minutes. grab my phone and i see a new notification *tinder: new match* "fuck yes can't wait to see who i matched with ohh damnnn shee a modelll kinda has small fits for a model though but i'll tap that ass, all mada,fuckin day" -me thinking to myself i see that her name was the same as my birth month so i send her a cheeky "your name is my birth month. has to mean something right?" now.we.wait . . . not even five minutes pass and i get "maybe 😚" we're in boyzzzz matching a hot model a day before valentines day. what are the odds. now i'll just charm the shit out of her and boom, we get married. yes, me, married to a model, same dude that they used to call "a walking wardrobe" at school. take that. we start chatting, you know, small talk, what music do you like, where are you from (she was a 15mins drive away). her: i really like you, i think we are a good match me: i couldn't agree more 😘 her: add me on facebook, i don't like talking to people on tinder. me: sure, whats your last name i added her and got an accept in seconds. within 10mins she had liked around 5 different pictures on my account (one of them being from ages ago). i stalk her a little bit, alot of cringe post on her wall, jfc she a normie, my soul mate is a fucking normie, of course the universe had to play me like that. "hey [u/protect\_ya\_neck\_fam](<url>) here's a model wife, did i mention she post 20 "quotes" a day on facebook and when she uploads a picture she tags half her fuckin friend list so they all leave a like and cliche comment." - the universe she had mention in both her fb and tinder bio , that she likes tattoos and piercings. so i ask her if she has any. her: only 1 tat so far but 8 piercings me: oh thats alot of piercings! where do you have pierced? her: 2 on my left ear, 3 on my right ear, my belly button and my tounge. me: coolcoolcool. but that's 7 piercings. her: yeah, i wanted to leave the last one as a surprise 😘😘 me: wowza, what about your tat? her: it's on my arm *sends picture of the close of the arm and you could see half her body* this is when things start going south. when i looked at her arm and how she was standing up in the picture kinda gave me the creeps, i did not know why, it just felt....strange. me: i like the tat, looks sick her: thank you 💖 *sends another picture* this picture was a mirror selfie where i could see her whole self and a man dancing behind her. from the way he was dressed i could tell he was gay. still being high from the joint i smoked at lunch, i found the position the gay dude was in funny so i said me: "the dude in the background cracked me up 😂😂" her: he is my best friend. alright thats good, i usually do well with gay people, i've met several gay man and we always seem to get along well. it will be good if i could get along with her best friend. i start stalking her on facebook so.much.cringe. when i was in the 'about' on her profile i saw the her listed as "male" which was weird and she sometimes looked kinda...off in certain pictures. there were only about 8 pictures of her but the account was created in 2015, the rest of the pictures are just pictures she was tagged in. i start digging around in the account because something has made me suspicious . i find what looks like the gay best friend from the picture she sent me and go to his profile, start stalking him with hopes of finding pictures of her. there was a video of him and another gay dude dancing to some weird techno song, the video was posted in 2013 and both of them looked really young. i taught maybe its an ex boyfriend or something. i realized that the girl i was chatting with left a comment her: nice one bro, was fun the gay dude: only because you were there, love you axel. hol up why'd he call her axel. no no no no no no no i knew something was wrong god fuckin damn it "did i mention she used to be a guy?" -the universe i asked her "weird question, but were you called axel before?". this is the nicest way i could ask 'are you trans'. she leaves the message as seen for about 20mins and than she writes "hey, i'm back. so what are you doing for valentines day?" she completely ignored my question wtfffff i stopped responding to her and she stopped texting. i have no problem with trans people, they can do whatever they want, as long as it doesn't effect me. but for the love of god, do what the rest of the trans people do on social media and dating sites, leave a note in your bio even 'ts' is fine thank you for reading - i will never be using tinder again. tl;dr: model that i matched with on tinder turns out to be a guy and he/she probably never planned to tell me.	0
saying goodbye probably one last time... i can't take this anymore. my life is not worth it. so, just before i leave for good at some point, i want to say my final goodbye to all of you. thanks for trying to help me, but i can't handle it any longer. i feel hated by everyone. my advice to you, before i do...leave... forget about me. just move on with your lives. i'm sure i won't be a waste of time, space, air, and money. farewell, everyone... 👋😔	1

i'm ending my life tomorrow.hi. i never thought i'd post on here. i don't even know where to begin. i'm 22. i've suffered from depression for as long as i can remember, and have had suicidal thoughts since i was 10. i believe i have bpd, but it hasn't been diagnosed. i've attempted suicide a handful of times but never succeeded, mostly because i wasn't 100% committed to the idea. i don't have a bad life. i'm not close to my family, but we're not estranged either. my parents love me, but didn't really know how to handle my emotional issues and i never got the help i needed when i was a child, so i've been trying to play catch up on my own since i've had access to resources. medications don't work. therapy doesn't work. meditation doesn't work. healthy diet and exercise doesn't work. i'm at a loss for what to do. i was bullied severely as a child and i thought, once that stopped, i'd be happy. but i wasn't. then i was fighting with my parents all the time, and i thought once i moved out and went to college, i'd be happy. i wasn't. i went to school for 3 years but then dropped out because my depression got in the way. i lost all my friends and my apartment and i recently had to move back home. since the beginning of this year, i've moved back in with my parents, my car has broke down for the third time, i've started a miserable job i'll probably be stuck in the rest of my life, and worst of all, this week i lost my best friend of 7 years. she was the most important person in my life. my soulmate. she's cut off all contact with me and i don't blame her. i was so motivated at the start of this year to be a better person but without her by my side, i don't want to be anything. all the color has drained from the world. i can't eat. i can't sleep. and it's not her fault i feel this way. it's the realization that i'm such a terrible person that the best friend i've ever known, who's been there through thick and thin, who just the night before she stopped talking to me was telling me how everything was going to be okay, could completely cut me off. i hurt her so bad that all the promises of our future together are no more. and i cannot forgive myself for that. i'm going to make an exit bag, but a real shitty one since i have no car to go get supplies. i only have stores i can walk to available to me. i just so happened to find out i have the day off work tomorrow, so my parents will leave me at home alone before they go off to work. i'll then go pick up my supplies and come home and hopefully within the hour i'll be gone. i don't know why i'm writing this out. i guess i want to tell someone. it seems weird to die and just not say goodbye. so. goodbye. if it doesn't work or i change my mind, i'll update by saturday night and let everyone know. if i don't update, you'll know it worked. i just want to urge anyone out there who's thinking of suicide... please, don't do it. i know i sound like a hypocrite but one day everything's going to work out for you, no matter what you're dealing with. the world wouldn't be the same without you in it. i'm sure after i'm gone, there will be people who will wish i hadn't done it. but i'm being selfish. i don't want to suffer anymore. don't make my same mistake. thank you for taking the time to read my post. it's good to know my final thoughts will be read by someone. 🖤	1

i have a terrible time meeting up with people on the week days i'm energetic during the day, tired at night. usually stay up late also playing video games or homework. come weekends, i'm tired during the day, blow my friends off, then i'm lonely at night when they're doing stuff and i'm alone. then also when i go to hang out with them, i'm like "i just gotta do a few things first." then by the time i'm done (an hour or so later) they're gone or moved on to something else and i missed them 🤷🏼‍♂️ always happens. i'm late and unsure of myself, but they don't give me notice and aren't too flexible, so it doesn't always work out.	0

trying to make a tinder match laugh this actually happened today. so this morning i was taking my typical third cup of coffee poo and swiping right on tinder when i got a match. the girl was cute and i noticed that we went to the same college, and both liked a lot of the same music. i thought nothing of it because i rarely talk to my matches, when all of a sudden she messaged me by saying "hi ☺️". at first i thought she was a spam bot, but luckily her instagram account was synced with tinder, so after a quick creep session i verified that she was real. throughout the morning, we messaged back and forth talking about music, traveling, and other stuff. things were going surprisingly well. here is where i fucked up... i started to get a little over zealous and asked her if she wanted to hear a funny pick up line, that someone told me the other day. she agreed. i proceeded to send her the following: "there are about to be 7 planets left in our solar system after i destroy uranus". now honestly, i was not trying to destroy her anus, i just really thought this was a funny pick up line. she messaged me back telling me that i was disgusting and proceeded to un-match me. i was a little disappointed that i blew it with some cute girl, but also had the attitude of "fuck this girl, she has no sense of humor". so, after a few minutes i forgot about it and went about my day. after a few more hours of work, i was getting ready to go to lunch when i got a call from my mom... my mom proceeded to ream me a new one and told me that i needed to be more respectful of women, and that she didn't raise me to be a misogynist. turns out, this girl was best friends with a girl who was my mom's best friend's niece. the girl i sent the pick up joke took a screen shot, and sent it to her best friend, who recognized me as a facebook friend and sent it to her aunt. her aunt then sent it to my mom. tifu, by trying to make a girl laugh with a perverted joke, and now my mom has a screenshot of me telling a girl i am going to destroy her anus.	0

embalm or, not toi made an appt last wed for a free counseling session, at a trauma and grief based place for this am. last night, i had a meltdown and finally bought the formaldehyde that's been sitting in my cart... i wasn't going to go to the appt. i had planned to box things and leave notes etc till my package arrived in 8-10 biz days. but my cat actually woke me- by standing on top of my aquarium peering in thru the plexi glass window top, and then looking at me. i kid you not, if you knew how old she was and her demeaner you'd know how out of sorts it really was. it was like she was saying, who's going so take care of us? (not look ma i want a snack-she's a sweetie). of course i didn't look at it like this at the time, she knocked something over and i was in mid lucid dream when she woke me😑. i really love my pets though and they are all i really have. and they don't deserve to be abandoned. i myself know that feeling too well. so i do feel really guilty every time i want to give up. either way, i made it to my appt bc i thought why the hell not. i'm awake and my pets rn are kinda irritating me. 🤷🏼‍♀️ no expectations of being helped even the slightest. after 4 long years of begging for guidance from anyone who will listen to me. to the point that i'm now honestly so much worse bc i've been so isolated and in so much pain. but today i finally got covered by a grant for therapy at this place. i showed up. and it was really hard to. but i'm really glad i did. bc someone finally saw my worth today and i have to say, i'm feeling a little better.	1

update a friend's [27m] girlfriend [23f] hates me [22f] after discovering our shared nickname for her - that out of context is totally awful. my earlier post[<url>] about calling my friend's girlfriend a jealous vampire got a lot of attention. most of you hate me, and that's fine. i come off nasty and petty when the only thing you know about me is that i did something nasty and petty. i could write you a novel about how i saved a kitten once or whatever but it wouldn't change anything relevant to this. that said, there have been some weird developments, there was a lot more to this whole ridiculous argument, and if only for your amusement, here's the rest. i don't really need advice on this one, going forward nate will be blocked, contacting me or emily *will* result in a formal report to the university on both our parts. a lot of you asked why he slept over/mentioned that that was stupid. why has we gone drinking at all? that's true, it was, we shouldn't have. it was late at night when this all went down and the only things open were pubs. i honestly thought a chat in a public place would look better than him running to my place for comfort or whatever. he then missed the last bus home and stayed because taxis are expensive. the apology was badly worded - i was upset and tired, and trying. i know it wasn't a real apology and i have since spoken to her and actually said the words "i'm sorry". when i said i would "win" in the comments i didn't mean that i thought getting rid of kate was "winning". basically when i met up with nate he started to go on about how this was kate's fault. i shut him down and told him it wasn't, and he proceeded to tell me that if it came down to it he'd always take my side... knowing what i know now i get why he said that, and i'm so ashamed i didn't catch on to how fucked up this all is a lot sooner. my friend sent me updates on what she's said *with her permission*. i wasn't sent screenshots or anything, basically just "she's been crying and she told me that there's a lot you don't know". this led to a phone call with the friend acting as a mediator. so back to the story. as mentioned in the comments of the last post, a friend got in touch and told me that kate had reached out saying that her relationship was falling apart and it was my fault. my friend "anna" was told everything kate's been through and was shocked. there's a lot more than any of us had been told, and anna was 99% sure i didn't know about this. she asked kate if she honestly thought i'd be friends with nate if i knew, and she agreed to talk to me. on the phone i immediately apologised properly and she blew me off. she asked if i knew nate was "obsessed with" me, and i told her that we're just friends, the kiss meant nothing, blah blah. yeah, turns out that's not what he told her. shortly after she asked about our past and we were open about it, he admitted to her that the only reason we weren't together is that i'd told him i hadn't felt anything. he had wanted something with me as long as i had up to that point, but where i didn't feel anything, he genuinely thought it could continue. he didn't want to lose me, so he just avoided his feelings. that's bad enough in itself, but he also admitted to that being a pattern. of the girls he's dated, they all seem to be about 5 years younger than him. apart from kate and myself, none of them have been in his department or at any risk of breaking uni rules, but all but one of them do attend my university. he apparently likes "role playing" and asking these girls to pretend to be girls he's into. specifically myself and his ex-girlfriend from a couple years ago. kate flat out refused after she met me - but went along with it a couple times before, because he doesn't *tell them* that the girl they're pretending to be is someone that he actually knows. he got a wig and an outfit (a dress identical to one that i wear a lot, a cheer uniform for his ex) for each of us, and makes them say certain stuff - i can't control what people fantasise about, but to go to this length and not tell your *actual* partner that they're playing your ex or your crush is a little serial killer-ish. anyway, he's also lied about his age. when he met me he said he'd just turned 26 a couple months ago... when he met kate, he'd turned 26 a week ago - probably about a day after we made plans to do something for his 27th birthday 🙄 she looked at his provisional in passing once and noticed that he a. uses his middle name instead of his first. not that weird by itself, but a bit strange that he didn't tell her. when she asked about it he just said he decided to go by his middle name in sixth form. b. lied about his birthday. his actual birthday is the date he gave me, but he's a year older (28). what he told her was just random and wrong. he justified it by saying he didn't want her to "feel uncomfortable". then got annoyed when she told him that she was definitely uncomfortable, the age gap is almost two years more than she previously thought. c. had an address from a city different to where he said he was from and our uni. she asked him when he'd lived there and he said that it's where his parents lived. she asked why he'd said he was from a different city and he told her it's the city in his post code, the nearest city to where he grew up. but without giving too much away, he essentially told her that the reason his id has a york address on it is that he lived in leeds once and leeds is in yorkshire. not those cities but similar logic. like it made no sense. she knew about the nickname. that wasn't what any of this was really about. she'd seen it a while ago, asked, and been told it was a name *i* called her. he went along with it for fun or whatever. she asked him to stop and he told her she was overreacting. it was still a shitty name and even now knowing my version of events she doesn't like that the joke didn't stop when she stuck around, but she says she probably would have found it funny if i'd told her about it before all of this. instead, she was convinced that nate and i were having some weird affair and distancing ourselves from her with stupid nicknames and lying about what we did when she wasn't around. she doesn't want to see nate again, and while she forgives me for the name thing she doesn't really want to drop everything and be best friends. that's fair. she's asked me to gather her stuff from nate's house and meet her for a chat. she told me she won't make decisions for me but hopes i'll reconsider my friendship after all this. to be honest i don't feel comfortable going to his place after what i know, so anna is going to come along. i haven't said anything to him about what i know and don't plan to until we have kate's stuff. i don't think he'll get violent or whatever, but i can see him damaging her things as some petty revenge, and since i've learnt i don't know him at all i can't guarantee he won't react really badly. after anna and i grab her things we plan to contact nate together and tell him that he needs to stay away or we'll report him to the uni. i know he's been very careful about not breaking the rules and hasn't "technically" done anything wrong, but since befriending students and trying for romantic relationships immediately after his restrictions end seems to be a pattern, i'm sure they'd at least watch him and it would look bad professionally. i don't think there's much more to say. like i said, i don't think kate and i will be best friends, but if she wants to stay friends with anyone in the group it's pretty safe to say we're all dropping nate. going forward i'm going to watch what i say and assume anything said about someone without them present is going to get back to them - with or without appropriate context. i'll be better about boundaries and suspicious of anyone who isn't. tl;dr it turns out the topic of my post was a side issue and the reason for the massive shit show that followed had to do with my creepy friend making his hookups pretend to be girls he's infatuated with, including myself. i have apologised properly and while i'm not fully forgiven we're moving forward and taking the appropriate steps to avoid the guy causing more problems.	0
why are we all feeling so sad? i came here as a last resort. for years i've been telling myself i'm strong, this will pass. it's not fucking passing, just getting worse. i'm useless, crippled. body & mind falling apart. just got denied disability again and now food stamps are cut off. i'm already living in a motel in an abusive relationship. i've never been perfect, but i'm not a junkie, criminal, have a very strong moral compass. how did my life turn out like this & why doesnt anyone care? if my friend or family was in this situation i would help, and have helped many times when i was able. i can't get the thoughts out of my head. i've been on all these psych drugs for years, i tried so hard to get a job, nothing is working for me. i'm rotting away in a damn motel, have no clue how to even begin turning this around. i'm so unhappy & in so much pain. i come to this sub, and see dozens of posts just like mine just from today. we should all pool resources& just buy land and start our own community. i forget the quote- but something - it's not a measure of health to be well-adjusted in a sick society. i should make a throwaway bc ppl may know my account & i don't want to be committed. i want out of this existence and i know it's going to happen soon. i'm so hurt by everyone that has turned their back on me, the state for letting me flounder when i was a good little citizen my whole life. so i'm "pretty" & "so smart" and absolutely nobody gets it. none of that matters. i'm useless and hate everything about my life. this isn't going to pass. "get up, get out, do something" doesn't work when i literally have nothing to do, and no desire either. thanks for listening to my story. i'm sorry for all of u that feel this way also, this can't be life. someone once told me for others to be happy, equal amount must be miserable. yin ☯️ i guess.	1

offering a man with one arm "a hand" so this happened last year when i was backpacking solo thru london. it was around 11:00pm and i was getting off a late flight and trying to find my hostel on some streets i've never been on before. i really had no clue where i was other than my google maps on my phone showing me where to walk from the tube to my hostel. as i was walking i came across a homeless man who was sitting on the street trying to open a bottle of ginger ale. he was having difficulty opening it because he only had one working arm and a stump near his elbow on his other arm. he was holding the bottle between his legs and trying to open it with his good hand but it was on pretty tight so when he turned it, it was turning in his legs. i, a good canadian boy, saw this man in distress and like the good person my dad raised me to be i offered to help him. it happened so fast and i didn't even think about it, so i walked up to him and blurted out "hey do you need a hand?" 😐 i immediately realized what i just said to this poor man and felt terrible because that's not what i meant. he heard me. he let me open his bottle and he guzzled it away. he yelled something incoherent at me and stammered away. i think he was semi appreciative but still insulted. i immediately felt terrible for saying what i said but i honestly tried to do a good deed and today i just messed it right up. frick. tl;dr i helped a one armed man open a soda bottle but first asked if he needed a hand.	0

telling a black kid in my class he should try dyeing his hair with kool-aid. this was back in high school but it still haunts me to this day. i was in history class and our teacher had put us into study groups of 4-5. so naturally we weren't doing much of anything. the other kids in my group (two white kids and one hispanic girl along with j, the black kid) were talking about random things and got on the subject of hair dye. one of the girls was talking about going blond and this kid said, 'man i'd like to dye my hair red but it's hard for black people to dye their natural hair.' i was really into hair dye (still am) and had recently remembered a method of hair dye where yoh could use sugar free kool-aid and cold water to somewhat dye your hair. so i told him, 'you could dye it with kool-aid.' 🙃 *i didn't know about the fucking kool-aid stereotype!* but you bet your ass everyone else at that table did. they all just sat there staring at me in mixed faces of horror and disbelief until j goes, 'daaamn sailo! ok so it's like that!' and just bust out laughing and everyone else started laughing as well. i was so damn confused. i didn't get what was so funny. and even though j laughed it off i think he was actually a little hurt because he avoided me for a bit. it wasn't until a few months later when i figured out by talking to friends what was so wrong about my statement and i wanted to die. i did apologize to j and explained that i didn't know about the stereotype. he was really cool about it and stopped avoiding me. still, goddamn.	0

(low priority) i finally started thinking about iti'm in no immediate danger. i'm not even sure this is the right subreddit for it. it's just... i've been doing great. i've been working on my career so it'd look great in my cv, my body is sore of the immense workouts, i'm studying a lot of things, i even managed myself brushing teeth twice a day instead of once (or none at all). i have even read a fiction book, for the first time in, like, 5 years. i have no idea what caused this. it was 5:00 am, i jumped into the car, feeling really sad and alone and hoping that it'd cheer me up, drove right to the nearest mcdonalds' drive-thru. i was crying, like, for 20 minutes. then, out of nowhere, i had a thought that it'd be a great time to kill myself. perhaps, a mcmuffin saved my life - that shit is awesome. i hesitate telling anyone close to me about that. i think i'm overreacting. i _am_ overreacting. it's really irrational and stupid, and i haven't even ran of the possible options to climb out of it - like, saving some money to finally get a therapist instead of wasting it on gas and junk food. it's just a nice thought to have. i don't really contribute anything crucial to the community. i do my best to support my friends and my girlfriend in their tough times. i like to think that i'm not that bad at it. and now, when i feel i need someone of them to talk to, i just think "nah, they won't help me anyway. what do they know about that feeling. it'd just make things worse. they could even gossip about me. they'll just dismiss it." it takes a lot of preparing - if i were serious to kill myself, i'd make damn sure it would be lethal. i'm too lazy to prepare. but the mcmuffins solution™️ won't last long. and, being depressive (but not suicidal) for a long time makes me think that i'm becoming suicidal. i'm just curious how much time i've got left till i choose to do it. how the hell do i say the truth to them that i'm not ok without them feeling shitty or sorry for me.	1

my best friend blocked me cause he couldn't take a joke. he was my bestfriend since 3 years and he was a photographer. yesterday night i posted a comment on his ig photography picture stating "its as ugly as u lol😂". he lost his cool and immediately blocked me in every social media. and he lives miles away from me. the regret's too hard for me now. maybe i shouldnt have said that. photography was his passion and i insulted it.	0

i just want it to stopim a 25 yr old female. i'm clinically depressed and have generalized anxiety. (diagnosed at 14) i was raped two years ago by a ex, i'm in crippling debt, and i have so much anxiety i can't work a proper job. i'm a opiate addict (it's the only thing that makes me happy) and i'm so unmotivated. i just want to die. i think about it everyday. i've tried all kinds of antidepressants. they don't help. i'm stressed out. i can't afford my bills and my car payment. my father just reminds me of how much of a disappointment i am everyday. he doesn't think depression is real 🙄. i honestly just feel like a waste of space. it's selfish of me to want to kill myself, but honestly i don't care anymore. i feel like people should be somewhat happy for me that i'm finally at peace and i don't have to suffer anymore. idk.. i'm so close to giving up. the only thing keeping me alive is my dog. i just want to die and make the pain stop.	1
im sorry but i play on switch and im 14. my parents don't understand buying online services when we already have wifi my im the only boy and my sisters hate video games so i turned to 2 games till today. today i turned to realm royale and hopefully it's my new favorite game but those two games are fortnite and paladins: champions of the realm hi-rez is my favorite company but fortnite is currently still my favorite game.🙂	0

i was dumped and i seriously don't think i can survive this.i was just dumped by my girlfriend the other night, and i don't know what to do. "i can't really say i'm in love with you" is what she said. this just came out of nowhere and i feel like i can't breathe. just a couple of days ago i thought we were still madly in love, now i'm heartbroken and i feel like i'm going to have a nervous breakdown. i just wish i knew what went wrong. i wish she would tell me that i did something wrong, tell me that i fucked up, tell me i had abhorrent personality traits, at least then i could make some sense of it. but she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. she likes me, and cares about me, but she's not in love with me anymore. how am i supposed to react to that? how can you say you love me on sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on friday? she keeps insisting that i didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am i supposed to understand that? i'm just hurt and confused. she stopped by my house the other night to return some things i left in her apartment, my shirt she had (and it still smells like her 😢 ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents i gave her for valentines this year. i don't know what i'm gonna do. i spent all night crying, i feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. it's like i'm trapped in a nightmare i can't wake up from. whenever i was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. despite all the bullshit i deal with on a daily basis, i always felt alright, because i knew that no matter what happened i had her beside me, and she made everything alright. i honestly don't know how i'm gonna make it through winter without her. our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and i was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. but when dumping me she was just so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. we were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to react. she said she doesn't see us having a future together; i saw us potentially getting married one day, i definitely saw a future with her. and she used to see one with me, i just don't know what changed. i don't know how to deal with this. without her i just feel dead inside. just last week i was so happy, now i don't know how i'm gonna live without her. she was the best thing that ever happened to me, now i feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. she said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. i don't think i could ever find anyone else as amazing as her. the only one i feel like i can turn to at this moment is my best friend. they try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but i'm a crying mess right now, and i don't feel ready to try to date again; but they are making me go back to online dating and i don't really feel strong enough to object right now. i've never felt this hurt and empty. i don't know how i'm supposed to make it through this.	1

hello, to everyone who reads this post. i've posted on here a few times already doing posts like these and i'm sorry if some people don't like these kind of posts. i shouldn't be sorry because i don't know any of you or don't know the people who read this, but i do feel like i have to apologize in advance. honestly everytime i'm in a down mood, i like to post here because it makes me feel better to spread some kind of positivity, even if people may take is as a hollow statement or gesture. it's nice being a kind stranger and being thoughtful and receive it back, but there's nothing better than that, truly. but this is the best to work with and i wish i could spread love to everyone and hope the happiest for everyone and hope the best. i know, why can't i just be that way and act that way to myself so then maybe i can try to be happier? i do. but i've lost strength doing that. i just want the thoughtfulness and kindness of this post to matter to those who aren't having a good day like me, or maybe even for awhile now like me. but none the less... i hope you're having a great day and keep the love going. love, happiness, and peace can really change the world, no matter how corny or cliche that sounds 😊 i love you, whoever you are and i hope the best for you. sidenote: i can understand if people may think, "if you don't have the strength to be happy, why should others just suddenly have the strength to be happy?" i understand. but that's why it's good try to spread some happiness to others, wither they need it or want it or not want it. if i can try to spread love/happiness, even if i can't do it for myself, i at least can try to do it for others. i'm just that kind of person and i always put other in front of me. thank you for your time to read this. to keep this relevant with the sub.... music can really define the mood i'm in and i really put my emotions into songs when i'm feeling a certain way. for example, i have yesterday in my head because i long for the things back then in my life. what song or songs define a certain mood you're in?	0

he [m/21] wants to wait until he's done with school to be engaged (not married per se), but i would prefer sooner and have already graduated. throwaway so hopefully no one figures out who i am. hello friends, i don't know if i'm being unfair about this scenario. (for context, i do have an anxiety disorder.) if i am, you are welcome to be honest, but please be nice 🙂 my boyfriend and i have been together for about a year and a half. we were in the "talking phase" for months before said relationship began. out of the blue, during our second semester of being in a relationship, he suggested moving in together, and we planned it for several months. i am moving in with him in august, and it doesn't feel too soon or out of place in the slightest. he's my best friend. i graduated college this month, and i'm moving on into job-land for a year before i choose and begin a master's program, probably at the same university. my boyfriend still has a year and a half before he graduates. the idea of marriage has been on the table for a while. i have made it clear that that's my end goal in a relationship, partly expecting that to scare him... to my surprise, he has been very open to it after discussion and wants to start a joint account for us to save up for a wedding. (that part is a secret and he says neither of us are allowed to tell anyone what it is, which is why i'm using a throwaway.) this has been a big deal, because a mutual friend that has known him longer says she thought he would never want to get married. he does, however, wish to finish school at the very least before he proposes, and that that will mean we'll be married "within five years of the time we started dating," and even then, he can't give me a definite timeline because i get overly curious whenever he plans something and i ruin surprises for myself. on one hand, i get that on some level, i am letting my family pressure me a bit because they continuously ask me or my parents when we are going to get married or whatever. (they do not understand the scenario because they are either old fashioned or they got married before even being in college.) on the other hand, i am having some (okay, a lot of) anxiety about the possibility of him putting off being married because he may not actually want to be married, while i realize i have no right to believe that based on what he has offered. i have asked if it's about the expensiveness of a ring, even though my mother has tons of diamonds she doesn't use and could be re-set and i don't expect a several thousand dollar ring as soon as he proposes. i have asked for any reason why he feels that way, and he just says "it's simply because i don't want to be engaged during college." he doesn't feel he owes me another explanation other than that. and part of me even feels like i'm so much more ready than he is because i am over the idea of undergrad and he is still caught up in it and being with his friends. i'm just at a loss about how to feel here. i really long to be engaged and to know that there is permanence to the relationship. i don't want him to feel like i am pushing him into something he's not ready for, and he has expressed not wanting to give up his own views on engagement. but i high key do not want to give up my own feelings about it either..... and i don't understand why he will not explain to me his reasoning. any advice will be helpful because i am frustrated.	0

i finally graduated from college and will go to japan and taiwan next month for 4 weeks :) hello cc, i finally graduated from college and got my degree. i dropped out and worked for full time for year. however, i wasn't satisfied with my current situation and realized i needed to go to college to get a degree. i finally got my degree after 4.5 years and will travel to japan and taiwan next month. i don't have told anyone about this, but i am really happy with for first time in a long time. i had bad grades and self esteem issues through out college and wanted to quit again but i decided to push on. after a lot of struggle i finally finished it and i am more positive what the future brings. also excited about japan and taiwan obviously 😁	0

do you ever call adults by their first names? i don't even call myself by my first name tbh. there's this one guy i work for and he never told me what to call him but i just call him bob and it works. teachers obviously are mr/ms/mrs/other and at my church everyone calls each other brother and sister, which as weird as it sounds in english (its in spanish) it really has the same sense of mr to ms/mrs. anyways, spread some pear love 🍐🍐 <3	0
feeling kinda disheartened i don't think anyone will love me. i guess that i don't fit the description of a stereotypical male that most women look for. they don't really even talk to me because i guess im so desperate to have a friend. i moved away to start a new life because you're supposed to take action when things go wrong, and im still extremely isolated and stuck. people ask if i like the new town. i have to say i like it but i want to hang myself. i really hate being a suitor, and im trying to get a hobby but i have severe adhd and ocd including other mental health problems, and i just hoard about drawing and piano playing. im feeling depressed 😞. people are better at me at everything without even trying. what the fuck do i do just go on dating apps and act desperate.😖🔫 i want to kill myself. i just want a muse, friends, a wife, feel proud of myself instead of this. i wish i could do a good job like the rest of my peers.	1

are you getting dramatic about nothing?? ask yourself the 5's!! (disclosure: this is my first post, and i don't know if it's in the right place or relevant. feedback welcome 🤷🏼‍♀️) whenever any potentially negative situation pops up in my life, i do the "5's". it's served me well, and i figured i would share, in hopes it'll help someone else...... it works like this: ask yourself: 5 minutes: will this matter in five minutes?! if the answer is no, tell yourself that! if i'm waiting in a line, or someone cut me off, or someone i don't know personally was rude. f that! this doesn't change my life in any way, and so i'm not going to waste my energy on it, at all. 5 hours: will this matter in five hours? maybe you missed a flight or had a fight with a friend or you're running late (which wants to stress me out every time). maybe he/she/they didn't text you right back? really though, will that matter by the end of your day? if not, do some damage control and let it go. 5 days: will this matter in five days? sometimes things happen that will be a major inconvenience! things like, having to start a project over or getting sick, maybe missing some work, and suffering financially, because of that. the key word is "inconvenient". yes, it's understandable to get upset, but keep your perspective and stay as positive as possible. 5 months: will this matter in five months? maybe it's a move, or having to take a class over or you had a car accident these things are the time to take action! call your friends, your family, anyone who can help and change the course, to fit and/or change things in your favor. this too shall pass, but try harder and ask for help. it'll be there for you, or you'll find it. 5 years: will this matter in five years? these should be the things you allow to "consume" you. they're the decisions that deserve the bulk of your power and energy. things like school or children or marriage or a long term investment. whatever it is, it'll matter in the long run. i absolutely realize, that five minutes inevitably turns into five years, so sometimes the little things make a major impact. that said: i've found that often times just asking myself what "5" things belong helps me to keep things in perspective, and ultimately stay positive and productive.	0

i (25f) would like to change my relationship status on facebook with my bf (22m) but am afraid to ask because i've been kept a secret in the past hello there! sorry posting again because i'm still learning rules! 😬 this might be a tad long 😬 i'm new to all of reddit but was wondering if i could get some advice. backstory: i was in a relationship last year with a guy who refused to put our relationship anywhere on social medias for months. by the time he put it out into the world...we broke up two months later. i wasn't a secret from his family or anything...but he was a little shady in general. i had a feeling that because he was stationed somewhere far from me that he was getting girls over there and just wanted to keep his facebook clean in case they lurked. he wouldn't approve things i tagged him in on facebook or anything. just felt like i was some secret so he could continue doing really shady things things. and when i would bring it up he would always accuse me of just wanting attention and he "didn't understand" why it was so important to me even though i explained the best i could. so cut to now...my boyfriend and i have been friends for about three years. we did the whole friends with benefits thing (for about 8 months) and then decided to actually date (he asked me to be his girlfriend officially less than a week ago). i feel like i have to ask him to put our relationship out there but mostly because of the fact that he hasn't told his family yet...but i'm pretty sure they wouldn't be surprised when he does tell them haha. i know some people will ask why i even care...i've never really been in a position where i could put my relationship out there. i've either had long distance or couldn't put them in the limelight because of my job (weird i know) so i get pumped when i have someone within arm's reach to show off. i also feel insecure about asking because of how i was treated before. the fact that i feel like i have to ask is crazy to me. should i just ask and get it over with and quit stressing? or just let it all be and quit stressing? any advice or questions are welcome. 🤗 thanks in advance tldr: would like to change relationship status with boyfriend on facebook but am afraid to ask because previous bf wouldn't let me post anything at all about him	0
you're not worthless. posted byu/balaclava\_[5 minutes ago](<url>) ## feeling depressed? 📷**providing support** dear reader, i want to share the following with you because i recognise that you are depressed. i know...well *at least i think* i know, that the following will apply not only to yourself, but to others too whom are depressed. i am not so naive enough to assume that the sensations within your mind are the same as those of others who are depressed. i am also not so naive enough to ever believe that that i will ever fully understand the aches, torments, and darkness you often experience. i don't know what your first thought is when you wake up; nor do i have the slightest clue of the thoughts you have on a day to day basis. i don't know how long you've had these thoughts - and i don't know how/or/if they come and go. truth is, i *don't* know. that being said, i'm not writing to you as a person of authority. i am not educated within this field. some of what i write, is from a place of non-wilful ignorance. despite my ignorance and lack of deeper level of understanding; i carry on to write because i want to understand. i want to understand because i want to help. i do, however, ask for your forgiveness in advance. i ask that you forgive me for anything which i write which has, or may miss the point of what depression for yourself, (not others) really is. that being said, my letter begins. i) worthiness my understanding has led me to conclude that your depression is deeply interlinked with feelings of inadequacy, perceived worthlessness, and the presumption of being a burden. in this part of the letter, i'd like to talk about the perception of yourself being worthless. i'll move on to talk about perceptions, inadequacy, and presumptions of being a burden at a later stage. now - on the perception of being worthless. the objective of this section is to tell you that you are **not** worthless. this is a difficult task because you **believe** that you are worthless. your belief is flat out wrong. it's very difficult, if not nearly impossible, to convince someone/\[you\] that they are flat out wrong. our minds will go to extreme lengths to always be right because it's counterintuitive to tell ourselves otherwise. i'm not referring to situations where its socially acceptable to "be wrong" and its encouraged to think alternatively as such in discussions or debates. i'm referring to situations whereby we are alone. we spend most of our time alone. i can't think of any logical reason as to why anyone, in their solitude, would spend time trying to convince themselves against a belief they *already* have. i legitimately believe that *kendrick lamar* is better rapper than *lil pump*. i have no reason, in solitude, and with no one around, to spend time comparing the two and trying to make a strong argument for *lil pump* being the better rapper. i simply wouldn't do that because my mind was made up a long time ago, and the only time i'll revisit that belief, is if it comes up in conversation on or offline. we hold a belief about everything. and not in just the traditional sense of religion or politics; but in *every sense* possible. we have beliefs about very mundane words/items such as "chair", fork" or "fridge". our beliefs, and the things which we believe to be true, are created by our surroundings. life happens at such a fast pace that we often don't get a chance to scrutinise the sources of those beliefs. at this basic level, i hold the beliefs that, i) the most optimal way to sit down is on a *chair*, ii) the most optimal/efficient way to eat spaghetti is through use of a *fork*, and iii) the most optimal/efficient way to store food is in a *fridge*. i hold these beliefs because the immediate society im part of has given me tools to test these hypotheses. on large - they have all checked out. for instance; when offered spaghetti and am give western cutlery such as a knife/ fork/spoon; the fork has consistently proved to be the superior means of eating; thereby confirming my belief. equally; when i've left food outside the fridge, its gone off. even if you haven't personally measured this phenomena; its probable that at some stage in your life you were *told* that leaving food outside means it will go off. you believe this to be real and have no immediate reason to question it. it's not contentious. we can objectively confirm this belief by comparing food in and out of a fridge and checking how quickly microbes and bacteria spread. some beliefs can be measured; yet some, are more subjective. for instance; *forks*. in china, people believe that the most optimal way to eat noodles in through *chopsticks*. why is this? why when presented with a very similar food, people have different beliefs on the best way to consume it? i mean - it's not like spaghetti is massively different to noodles so why don't we largely use chopsticks to eat spaghetti in europe or the us? and why aren't people in china or japan largely eating noodles with forks? i've specifically used this example to highlight that some beliefs aren't necessarily right or wrong. we just don't question them because they aren't immediately contentious in the societies we are part of. unfortunately, our brains are overwhelmed with the information provided by the world to the extent that we don't find time to revisit our beliefs. this can particularly damaging for abstract beliefs. abstract beliefs include "love", "pain", "space", "worthiness", and things of a more conceptual nature. some of the abstract beliefs we have - we hold without scrutiny because the information which we created those beliefs from, was drip-fed to us through social cues. "worthiness", is one of such beliefs. it's an abstract belief we do not actively talk about and have (unfortunately) largely relied on parents, peers, siblings, and strangers to define it on our behalf. when we don't meet their \[and society's\] unrealistic and ever changing expectations; - we feel worthless. earlier, i stressed the point that it's difficult to go against a belief you hold because it's counterintuitive to do so in your own solitude.that being said, i'd like you to challenge the view of you have of being "worthless". your belief is wrong. the mere fact these words have been written for you; is an indicator that you, yes you - are of value and indeed not worthless. **expectations** together, we've established that feelings of "worthiness" are deeply intertwined with our inability to meet society's \[and yourself's own\] expectations. in this part of the letter i'd like to talk about *why you shouldn't care for expectations.* i can immediately think of two types of expectations which we should revisit. a) *expectations of yourself to yourself* having expectations for yourself isn't inherently a bad thing. expecting yourself to meet specific targets gives you drive. however, what you expect of yourself can also be detrimental to your health. i'll elaborate: if you grow up with someone, you don't notice them changing until you look at photos of them in the past. if you live with someone who goes to the gym; you may not notice their incremental gains until a situation arises whereby their physique is put into question (i.e - them trying on a new shirt).the same applies for your mind; you've grown up with your mind since birth, and into your adulthood. in the same way you don't notice the people you see everyday changing; you've probably never paid attention to the wisdom you've accumulated over the years and just how much you've changed. you aren't the same as you were yesterday and you'll be different tomorrow, wiser. for instance, last night i was turned away from a club because i was "dressed too casual". this morning; i've woken up with knowledge that the club in question has a dress code which i didn't meet, i'm now wiser. i went to the off licence yesterday and bought some toothpaste. on my journey, i walked past new strangers, i took a new route, and everything which happened was happening for the first time - i'm now wiser. you are the wisest you've ever been and will carry on to be so. that being said, why should you hold yourself to the expectations you gave yourself when you were less wise? think about it; if a 12 year old comes up to you and said *"you should be married by the age of 30, own this property, have x amount of children, own this type of car and earn x amount of money"* - you may think "f**k off - what do you know?". you wouldn't hold yourself to that 12 year old's expectations so why are we insistent on holding on to some of the expectations we created when were younger? its okay to have expectations of yourself, however; it's not okay to suffocate yourself because of them. you are too hard on yourself. the only consistent expectation you should hold of yourself is staying alive. we may not know the immediate purpose of our existence but your body definitively knows that you should be alive - hence why your heart is beating. you've met and continue to meet your own expectation to be alive. for that, you should be proud yourself. ------- ill talk about societal expectations and the other mentioned topics at a later stage. live.	1

[update] parents (50s) objecting to my (25f) plan to go visit bf (24m) for the first time previous post: <url> recap: in a relationship with bf for 1 and a half year knowing each other from an online game and he lives across the world. i planned to go visit him for the first time and parents did not take the news very well. hi, i got back a week ago from my trip to us to meet my bf and figure i should do an update since things turned out to be... interesting 😂 first of all thank you all so much for your advices and experience. i followed your advices and decided to shut down the conversation whenever they attempt to put me down. i stood my ground and told them enough is enough, this was my final decision and i would go through with it regardless of what they think. mom still tried to bring the topic up from time to time until the day before my flight, although she changed her tactics, tried to bribe me etc so i would give up my plane ticket, but finally she gave up and just wish me luck. honestly seeing her like that makes me feel a little bit guilty because even though we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, she's still my mom and i know she only worry about me and want me to be safe and happy. during that time i also connect them with my bf, let them know more about each other through direct conversations, and even though my mom doesn't really speak english she later told me bf seems like a decent person and she has a good impression about him. and so before my flight my mom gave me "the talk": "no matter what you do don't come back pregnant" which was kinda unexpected and pretty funny tbh 😂 she said "well i guess no matter what i say you will not change your mind, then i wish you all the best. take your time to carefully observe him, and also try to make your best appearance to him and his family". she also told me multiple times to invite bf over to my country and our whole family will be very glad to welcome him. not much to talk about my 2 weeks in us except that my plan b was not touched. everything was smooth, we clicked even better in real life, he's incredibly kind and attentive and his family were also very welcoming. we didn't end up have sex tho since i was too nervous but he was totally cool and respectful to me. we picked a gift for me to bring back home for my parents. dad didn't say much but i can tell he seemed to be content. so yeah everything is great except saying goodbye sucks. at least we are planning for him to visit me in a few months so that helps keep my spirit up. once again thank you very much for your advice and support. tl;dr: i processed with my plan, mom turned from objecting to supportive. went to us and returned in one piece, no missing organ. relationship going strong and (hopefully) it's getting warmer between me and parents.	0
i honestly don't have anything interesting to say; i just like seeing the orange envelope. i'm living in a country where i barely speak the language, so interacting with people who do speak the language is very very nice. edit: oh god, my poor inbox!! did one of you bring a bom- no, wait, that's just a clock. i'll reply to as many as i can!! edit 1.5: some of you might now want to comment because you think you won't be able to have a conversation, but if you comment i'm very likely going i reply! keep the conversation going! edit c: keep the comments comin' edit iv: praise be to the redditor who is too afraid to add a coment, gawd just spoke to me and he wants your seed......in the form of a comment.... praise be, praise be! edit 🎺: someone else needs to comment.... and his name is john cena!! edit sex: i want to see if we can break a cc record, keep the comments coming guys!	0

is she (f23) interested in me (m27) or is she playing hard to get? hey love from australia 🇦🇺 firstly. there's a tinder date that i went on a date with over a year ago. we agreed to be fwb and she made it clear that's all she wanted, but i felt like she wanted more so i ghosted. we had a great first date (lots of kissing but no sex because she didn't want it on the first date). i liked her but i ghosted her a week after our first date because i felt we weren't on the same page and i'm an asshole. we continued talking after the first date and i was hoping i could score soon but she wasn't giving in. then she asked me out for drinks a couple weeks later but i lost interest (she was also asking what are we?). about a month later i messaged her again for some fun but she was busy. keep in mind it also took me about a month to meet up with her the first time because she was busy. she was pretty inexperienced sexually (she told me that, and told me she has never given head before either) but i was fine with that and she seemed interested in women too since she was with one once (i told her to explore it). anyways, we stopped talking. months and months later i found her on instagram and gave her a follow, she followed back. her pictures were beautiful and i wanted to see her again. she would respond back interested, like all my pictures, but again was too busy to meet. i asked her to come to the beach with me and she couldn't because of work but asked if i was down to have a 3some with her and her friend (f22) up in a cottage that weekend. the plan flopped but it was nice of her to ask. she asked to see me a month later and i ghosted in the middle of planning the date. because i'm an asshole and was seeing some others at that time and wasn't too interested anymore. i'd watch her instagram stories. her "friend" that she sleeps with is also beautiful. they are best friends and hang out often. she made it clear that they are only friends though. she seems like a fun girl with a crowd of beautiful friends and family around her. anyways every so often i'd message her to remind her i'm alive and find her beautiful lol (i'm a confused man, came out of a serious relationship and not sure what i want). she seems very sexually experienced now and open about her sexualness when people would ask her things on online q&a's. she'd respond to some of my shirtless pictures i'd post too. anyways there is a very handsome guy it looks like she's seeing as well covered in tattoos. he's been in her stories on and off. since the end of summer till now. she's made it clear she's single but just having fun! there is also another guy (i think they're just friends but she calls him papi so who knows). she seemed very inexperienced when i met her but she seems very sexual now (not making her a bad person she's actually one of the nicest people). glad to see her exploring her sexuality. she has shown interest still recently in me. not in a cocky way but i do have other women interested in me that i'm interested in as well. i also feel that she posts a lot of pictures for me to see (again not trying to be cocky i've just noticed some things...but i might be wrong) so a couple weeks ago i booty called her since she lost everyone's numbers in her phone i texted her (perfect segway). i asked her to come over and have some fun. she said "i only fuck people i know well and vibe with, and i don't know you well 😕! i'm sure you'll be able to find someone tonight! have fun so much fun ;)". i said "i did thank you. have fun cutie". to which she replied "aayyy perfect 😂👌! and thanks babe :)" i've been seeing someone else more seriously (not exclusive yet) but i've always wanted to see this bisexual beauty who is studying to become a lawyer and works as a bartender while in school right now. **tl;dr**: is she into me? she calls me sexy a lot and responds to my messages even after i ghosted her twice. **what would you think of her if you were me?** should i delete her if i get into a serious relationship with someone else?	0

i don't know.hello. i don't know how to describe what i feel, my head is a complete mess these last days. i don't know what to do with my life. don't know what do do and think. sorry if this writing is a little long, you don't have to read it all, but thanks if you do. it's just a relief for my self to write something down and share, i don't know hopefully i'll feel a little better then. english isn't my first language as well so sorry for that too. i just feel completely empty and lonely. even though i have people around me who 'care'. i don't know where to start but let me say, i have been feeling different for as long as i can remember. as a young girl is was afraid of others, crowded places and to be judged. i can remember a moment where i was like 5: there was some kind of a celebration at school i didn't wanted to attend to because i was afraid of other people (?). mom let me stay at home. my childhood and teenage years are a blur, but this is what i remember where it all started. if i was afraid of something, my parent let me decide what to do. that caused that i am always on the background, even for now. i was thinking about suicide when i was probably 17/18. wrote many notes. at that moment i didn't even wanted to turn 18 and just wanna die. leave the world, because no one will miss me anyways. i went to collage, didn't felt at home. had to go with the bus everyday, feeling so damn insecure and wanted to die so bad. cried myself to sleep so many times. i couldn't compare myself to others. still don't. i (somehow) finished school. haven't got a driver license bc i thought i wouldn't be here for long so it wasn't needed. i didn't had the money as well. i'm 27, and still here. nothing changed in those years. i feel ashamed. old school friends are getting married and having children .. this voice in my head says i don't deserve this so why comparing myself to others. it's the only thing i know. i went to a psychiatrist a few years ago, didn't helped at all. they kinda forced me to be in this group with other people i didn't feel comfortable with at all, i had nothing in common with them. i was mad. still taking medication which also doesn't help imo. i'm so disappointed in my self. why didn't i take my life away when i was 18!? ten years later: i'm not living but surviving life. escaping reality. i absolutely never know why i felt this way. those talks with the psychiatrist didn't help because i myself even didn't know what happened in life that make me feel so disgusted about myself. about a week or two ago i came across an article about emotional abuse/neglect. i felt like my heart was sinking and at the same moment everything felt in place. my parent didn't support the things i did, never took me serious when i was afraid of things that seemed to be normal, or the things i was excited about. never focused on the things i found difficult at school or helped me with that. this has lead to so many things as an adult, i feel stupid and unneeded. we never went on vacation as a family, they were always focusing with their own business. i still love them, don't get me wrong. i'm just disappointed and wish i could do this all over again. there are so many more things i wanted to write down, but i feel like a burden and don't want to bother you all with my stupid words. i'm sorry. i just hope i'm not the only one. i hope there's one person who reads this and thinks: finally, i'm not the only one. who experienced the same, and i want to tell you that i love you and i'm proud you're still here. because living this life when you feel you don't belong, i can't tell you, it's not easy. ❤️	1
i've learnt a lot of things from reddit and you guys have influenced my life in a positive way. 💖 i can see how much i've changed compared to who i was before reddit: i've learnt to be more compassionate, to respect the other person's point of view, so much information, the hive minded nature, and a whole lot of stuff i probably would've been oblivious to if not for reddit. so thank you all for changing a smidgen of me for the better. what have you learnt from here?	0

my (20m) girlfriend (19f) just did something and i don't know how i feel about it. like with many things there's a lot of backstory so i'll try to keep this brief. there's this guy who works with my girlfriend, let's call him a. he's like 23 so it's a bit weird but despite knowing i exist he still asks my girlfriend to go out and stuff so she said she'd meet with him briefly in order to give him a proper talking to and hopefully get the message across that she's not interested. another friend of hers, let's call him b, happened to be in town today and they bumped into eachother before going to get a mcdonald's. i've never liked b much. he's always given me very weird vibes i don't know if he's autistic but i've never felt particularly welcome around him. they get on though so it's fine. anyway she ends up leaving a waiting at the bus stop while herself and b are at mcdonald's for 'a long time'. then she goes to meet a to explain that he needs to back off. b asks if he should stay back and after deliberation she says no so he goes with her. apparently she just ended up waffling to a and didn't get the message out at all. b was just standing there and now apparently a thinks he's her boyfriend (annoying enough as i don't like b) but now i feel bad for a for what she's done to him. keeps him waiting ages and then, considering he thinks b is her boyfriend (she's told him her 'boyfriend', ie me, doesn't like him) is brutally rejected effectively. i don't know how much of this she embellished/left out when she told me, but she feels really bad about it and i don't know whether my current feelings (slightly disgusted, but as understanding as possible) are justified. thanks you lot ❤️ tl;dr - my girlfriend did something horrid to a guy and used another guy to play as her boyfriend	0
y'all thinking about dumb shit like the meaning of life while i ask the important questions is taddy a girl or a boy🤔	0
what i'm not telling peoplei made an attempt a year ago when i was dumped. my family thinks i'm getting better but the truth is the only reason i haven't tried again is because they'd blame my ex, and i still love her and would never want her to be blamed for that or feel guilty. she has enough on her plate she doesn't need me fucking up her life 😞 but i wish i could die so badly, i wish with all my heart.	1

going on a bushwalk alone this only happened yesterday and i'm still trying to get over how it happened. we have been having some pretty shit weather lately (it's meant to be summer here) and yesterday was surprisingly very hot. since i wasn't working for once i decided to get out and enjoy the sun. unfortunately all my friends either study or work so no one was free to come for a walk with me. so i decided to go alone. near where i live is a national park with a lot of walking tracks, beginner, medium and hard. i wanted to challenge myself so i chose a 1 and a half hour round trip medium track (i'm not very athletic or fit.) managed to haul myself to the top in 35 minutes which i was incredibly proud of, took some niceish photos and decided to get out of the sun and back into the bush. i hadn't even been walking back 10 when i tripped on a tree root and fell forwards landing on my shin/knees. unfortunately for me, right where i landed a tree root had grown over a rock, providing a lovely landing pad, and resulting in a dint and gash in my leg. after screaming for 5 minutes (i was about 98% sure there was no one else on the track) i managed to text my mum to tell her what i'd done. she immediately rung to see if i needed help getting down which i said no to. we hung up and i kept walking. not even 1 minute later i started feeling sick and like i was about to pass out. call mum again and tell her to come get me. ended up at a&e (because mum didn't want to touch the mess that had become my shin) where they glued me up and sent me home. spent last night very uncomfortable with the heat and my leg and had to go to work today and explain to everyone why i was hobbling around 😏 tl;dr: went for a bushwalk alone. tripped and smashed my shin on a rock at the top of the track. mum had to rescue me and take me to the hospital to get fixed up	0
second time here (27/f)this is my second post here. i am unsure if it will be my last. there is 1 person tethering me here. just one. and thats alot to ask of him. i met him here. on this subreddit. we have helped each other alot but i cant get the thought out of my head. why the fuck do i deserve to be the one here. why couldn't my steobrither have been the one. he deserves it more than me. but this ill ness took him too. i know youre going to see this and i am sorry i not stronger. i am over feeling his numbness. but i made you a promise and i am trying to be brave. maybe its the alcohol or the lack of sleep talking but i am so done. ✌️	1

job suggestions? does anyone know of any call center customer service jobs or good work-from-home jobs? particularly in the austin, texas area. i am a stay-at-home mom but am looking into doing some part time work to earn extra money and get a break from the kids. i love customer service and helping people, and i'd greatly prefer a job that doesn't require a uniform or dressing up (sensory issues 🙄). thanks!	0
i'm going to kill myself today there's no reason to justify continuing my existence. my only regret is it will hurt my brother, but i've read people often feel relieved from parasitic mental patients such as myself when they finally do it. i hope that's the case. peace. ✌️	1
i wish someone would kill me 17 years of life, most have been miserable. i don't enjoy life. life is meaningless. there are billions of people in the world, who cares if one leaves? i've been on meds for over two years, nothing is different. i've been to inpatient, therapy, outpatient, etc. if you had a car that wouldn't work even after spending thousands trying to fix it, you would stop at some point. i have no motivation to live in a society, i have no desire to contribute to it, and i have no desire to live. 18 is the age i can buy a gun, only a few months away 🤗	1
update to: friend of mine, 24f, has been in a relationship with a 21m and is rushing to the altar. did i say the right things? was i direct enough? hi everyone! [link to original post](<url>) i am appreciative of al the thoughtful responses i got on my previous post. for as long as they've been dating, it's like night and day on her social media. on instagram, she'll post lovey dovey things then on twitter, she'll post cryptic, negative tweets. she'll post about not liking to be ignored or how her fiance always blames her for everything and can never hold himself accountable. i've reached out via text and she'll tell me that it has to do with their relationship and that they've been having problems but she never goes into detail. last weekend, she tweeted that she was in need of help and i was worried , so i reached out to her via text. she went into detail about her relationship problems and it was a lot. apparently they've been having a rough couple of months and have been getting into bad arguments. she told me that she kept her struggles to herself because she doesn't want to feel as if she's a burden to others. i told her that she's never a burden to me and that she can always vent to me, as she's done so in the past. she told me that he never holds himself accountable for the things he does. he always makes her feel that every single thing that is wrong is somehow all her fault and that she's the problem. she told me that she asked if he could conserve his $ and he flipped out. she also told me that he wants to carry his gun everywhere and she asked if he didn't because of safety concerns. those two things aren't unreasonable at all but apparently he got super mad because he thinks that she's trying to "control him." she told me that he went to get advice from our mutual close friend and she never k ew about that and that crosses all types of boundaries. i talked to the friend and they told me that they felt super uncomfortable because they didn't want to be in the middle of their issues. my friend's parents say that he could do better and be better but the guy just seems like an immature person. i suggested couples therapy and she said that she doesn't think it'll work and he doesn't want to partake in it, so she's giving up to god. i then told her that i saw a lot of red flags and here's everything else i said in my text messages: i said this in response: 1) oh wow. so he's very stubborn and can't see the error in his ways and due to that, he's pushing you away? that's terrible. if he can hold himself accountable for his ways, i think he needs to be let go even if it is hard. the inability to not work on something that's crucial to healthy, mature romantic relationships is a red flag. you deserve someone who will not always pin you as the bad person in the equation and is human enough to see their errors and work on them. that's fucked up that he went to one of your closest friends to try and probably paint you as the bad guy, too. 2)he needs to learn the definition of control because your actions do not equate to that. it's reasonable to ask someone you're planning on marrying to conserve their money at times. it's also reasonable to suggest not carrying a gun on him at all times. if he blows up at those simple things , that's a red flag too. when someone shows you who they are, believe it the first time. i just don't want to you keep waiting for him to "change " and he never does and you feel stuck. 3) i said this: to be frank, he sounds very immature. you have a lot going for you outside of him and based on your last few tweets, he doesn't seem to add positivity to your life. have you tried going to therapy with him? or have you suggested that? 4) putting god aside, everything you've said about your issues just scream red flags. it's your life but if he can't even agree to actually work on these issues and you feel that counseling wouldn't work, it makes no sense why you're still together. therapy, with the right therapist, can work but if you don't think that it can, what's the point of even being together? if no one seems to be trying to take legit, healthy steps in trying to work out your issues, that's not okay. you can walk with god and go where you feel he leads you, but sometimes you have to really see what there and what he's trying to show you instead of seeing what you want to see. i'm not trying to sound harsh but i love you too much to not say what i feel based on everything you've told me and ever tweet i've seen you tweet that has to do with your relationship. i have to go but you can always call/text me about it. i'll always listen from a place of love. 💖 5) i see that. (when she spoke of giving it up to god) however, if he can't even meet you halfway and he's engaging in toxic behavior by making you feel less than/bad about yourself , god could be trying to help you learn a lesson through him. every single person we meet in this life is either here for a season or a lifetime. it's up to you to figure that out. 6) okay, girl. just be wise about who you spend your time with and who you let inside your heart. 7) i said this: not everyone you meet is there with pure intentions. it can be hard to see certain things but as long as you really try to be objective about everything, you'll be fine. 8) just put yourself first and acknowledge your feelings . don't let anyone or anything make you feel that your emotions aren't valid. i love you and i'll ttyl. 💜 tl;dr we're still friends and still talk but i had to get what o thought off of my chest to her. i believe that she's only in this relationship because she may feel that she can't do any better than him. this is also her very first romantic relationship ever , so i think that she's trying to hold on because if not him, who else will love her? i also think that it's a self esteem issue. i realize that it's her life but it still sucks to see her going through this.	0

a story about me..hey there, i never thought i would post a personal topic about myself, but i just want to get this off my chest. and i hope i can find peace by doing this. well how do i start? let's give it a shot. i'm a 20 years old boy. yea if you look at my age you can clearly tell that i haven't matured, yet :d. the thing is, for as long as i can remember, i'm suffering depression. since when? i really can't tell the age, but i can assure you that i was very, very young for a person who can get depressed at that age. anyways, let's move on. lately, i'm getting sick alot. by that i mean sick as being really ill and sick as in mentally sick. and when those two mix up, i can surely tell you that this isn't a sweet cocktail. i always get headaches, throwing up, passing out, hands those are shaking etc. etc. and the mental part? well uhm. feeling depressed should say it all, but i'll clarify it a bit more. when that mental mood kicks in, i really want nothing. i just cry, wondering why this happens to me, detaching myself from everyone. everyone as in my family and even my best friend. (yea i consider her as my best friend because she feels like home to me and whom i really can rely on. let's say she is my little sunshine, hihi :).) but that's not the only thing. i act weird in the way as in not being myself, like a total other stranger. weird isn't it? i can't control that and i frequently talk about these kind of stuff with my best friend. sometimes it really does get things off my chest. anyways, why do i feel like this? do i have a bad life? no. i always smile, helping other people, doing whats needs to be done. is it because of my parents or my only friend? no, because i know they love me. my only circle. but why do i really feel depressed? if i dig deeper in my own thoughts, i always cried at certain things. i can tell you that i'm a very emotional person who also cares about other people, no matter how they treat me. even like dogshit. i will cry and wonder why, but ok. that aside. when i was a child, i saw my friends as an example of how to live a life. even tv shows! weird for a little kid, huh? but those examples were a deception for me. because i had a different life than them, other parents etc etc. but maybe that's why, parents. the things i'd liked, they took it from me. of course, i'm not saying i didn't do fun things, but the fun things didn't last long. i had to do what they say, seems normal yes. but i was forced to go to events what i totally disliked and was in my disbelief. but hey, if i didn't listen, they would yell the fuck out on me or sometimes, they would beat me. well, especially my father since i don't have a great bond with him. i always cried and wondered how it was to walk away. just walk away from my own problems. but would that solve somenthing at that kind of age? no, just no. i wanted to call the police, but i did not dare to. because i cared about my parents and i thought they would get in jail. see i do care hehe. furthermore, have i told you that i have a brother as well? ah yea, a brother who i really cannot really on. he beat me always, beated me for small things from which i was bleeding. wasn't fun, really not fun. but these are the things that i distance myself from them at home. like, i can't feel that family connection like other people do have, jealous.. this is a part of my life that makes me suffer from depression, i just can't forget it. i suffered it alot. but that's not the only thing. because i just hated my life basically. well, still do. i just do not know what i really want. i just giving things quickly up, because i cannot hold on to it. even at that young age, i wanted to die. yea it was that bad. i came to a point that i wanted to commit suicide. i was done, just done. but has it ever stopped since then? no.. i still got that feeling after all these years that passed by. but what about now? well, a few months ago i was planning to do it, i was so close doing it. but i didn't for a reason. and i don't feel sharing that reason. sounds stupid, sharing these things but that not hahaha. in this stage, i just don't feel happy about my life. i always get emotional, don't know what to do for my future and bla bla bla. even now i do have suicidal thoughts. sometimes i just really want to do it. i promised my best friend that i will never talk about that, but woops. forgive me, well she won't read this anyway. i hope. well getting to the point. this topic seems really messed up. from going 1 thing to the other 😂 sorry for giving you a headache by reading this. but it's really late. so there am i. wondering what i am gonna do. do i take the easiest path? or the fighting path. i would say fighting path, because never give up. but the way how i feel now, it's like i'm giving up.. i'm not scared of the easy path but i am for the fighting one. time ticks... thank you for your time, i really really appreciate your time for reading this.	1
do you guys hate when someone you really love just leaves you? my gf once told me i was everything she was looking for and out of nowhere she breaks up with me. how can i move on? first of all.. i'm sorry that this is a long ass story but i just really needed someone to vent about this whole situation that i've been through this past week.. idk it really means a lot to me if u guys read the whole story and give me some advice hahaha, thanks! hello. this is my first time talking about my breakup and this shit happened 2 weeks ago, this is the first time i open up about something like this to whoever reads it. i guess.. i really needed to vent myself about this whole situation and idk get the frustration, anger, sadness, confusion out off my body. so if you guys can help me out on this one.. i'd really appreciate it. because i don't know how to get over it/her. this past 2 weeks have been rough and mostly hell for me. most in the mentally way.. anyways.. how tf do you guys got over a breakup not just a regular breakup but a breakup were you felt she was the one? like you were mad in love with her and outta nowhere she dumps you? everything was outta of the blue so i don't know what i did wrong, that's why i'm so confused i thought we were good!! but i guess i was wrong.. and now i don't know what to do now? it just seems impossible to me to stop thinking about her.. so i haven't been in a serious relationship since i was 14 lmao (ik.. i'm a joke..) but yeah.. i'm 21 now. actually i have never met a girl like her before and she came outta nowhere. the way she thinks, her mindset, her personality and how she's so concerned about others and the fact that she knows what her goals are and has them so clear idk that's what made me go nuts for her.. she was super supportive, caring, loving and i honestly don't know what happened.. so we dated for a while.. years.. we were good, chilling, everything was fine or at least that's what i thought. she had to move out bc of med school so now we were like 6 hours away and a few states lol.. we talked about it and we agreed on that i was going to visit her every few weeks/months. i didn't have a problem with that cus i was really into her and i really wanted to work this temporary problem out. after two weeks of her moving out she was just acting weird, idk dry ass replies and shit. so i was like okay.. (i'm a very talkative guy and i like communication like i won't judge i'll never do that but if you're not being honest with me and you don't communicate at all.. we can't work things out cus i can't read your mind and just start guessing on how you been feeling). so yeah i asked her "what's wrong?" and she replied with the "we gotta talk" combo so i knew it was over. indeed she said aight we have to break up. she came up with the i miss you thing.. the i just won't be able to hug you and kiss you again like we used to. so that happened.. then a few days went by and she came back and was like "okay nvm i'm dumb i wasn't thinking properly, let's get back together" so i was like fuck yeah xd keep in mind this 1st breakup happened the first week of january.. now after our "first" breakup everything wasn't back to normal it just didn't felt right idk i felt weird and she kept acting mad weird. so i was like wtf is going on? tf? did i just do something wrong? i did something to make her mad? and i asked her again if something was wrong and i confronted her.. i was like you gotta figure this shit out. like how you feel about the relationship? are you ready for the commitment of a ldr? do you even still like/love me? she was surprised i asked her all of these questions, she took a few days to give me a real answer.. but when she did wow. her answer was. she cared so much about me and she loved me so much she just had to give up her "place" as my girlfriend to someone else. because now that we were in a ldr she wouldn't be able to hug me, kiss me and spoil me the way she was used to. i was really surprised i didn't spected that answer at all.. i was like "i don't want you to give your place up, i love you.. i don't want any girl but you.." we kept talking about it , trying to figure things out she was crying i was crying lmao.. and then she told me this and this is why i feel so confused and idk distracted, mostly frustrated!!!!!???? if u say so.. she said. "okay i'll be waiting for you untill i graduate out off med school, so we can be together again.. i'll be respecting your place as my boyfriend but we'll have to be friends for now.. yes i still see you as my partner but we are friends, okay? i'll wait for you and respect your place as my boyfriend". so i was like okay.. i was so happy about that answer she gave me that day. and everything seemed to be back to normal untill she started tweeting shit about guys and crushes and just stupid shit like that.. like she doesn't even care anymore bro it's obvious. but she hasn't said anything bout those tweets. talking about how she just met this dude and how she's so handsome and cool, idk.. that's why i feel so frustrated, weird, confused, angry, mad.. sad???? what do i do guys? should i wait for her? she seems to don't give a fuck about that promise. what do i do? what's y'all advice on this list situation? i'm so confused i don't know what to do.. and i don't know i feel like she's just wasting and taking away from me time and energy she doesn't even deserve anymore.. and obviously playing with my feelings.. should i ghost her or just forget completely about her? help me guys :////// i don't really know what to do.. thanks :// 😔😔😔😔😪😤 tl;dr basically my girlfriend broke up with me and i don't know why. i can't get over her just like that isn't that easy. she made a shifty promise to be waiting for me and respecting my place as her boyfriend even tho we aren't dating anymore and she just keeps posting and social media how she just met a new guy and how cool he is, etc.. i guess i'm her backup plan, now?	0
had 2 serious suicide attempts in 2018 hopefully i only have 1 successful attempt this year 😊	1
to anyone who is depressed or anxious reposted this because it died in new and i really want to help people because this has a lot of things i wish someone told me. call me a karma whore i don't care this is really important to me. i can't say that i know your pain because everyone's pain is different. i can say that i suffer from it. for a long time it was just pain and everyday was pain and the suffering wouldn't stop. i didn't want to live like that and i wish i could make it stop. what i will tell you though is to push through it. you can do it i know you can. everyone says this but it does get better. for a while i stopped believing in that because it never got better but you just have to keep that faith and remember that it will get better. because it does. there is this quote from billie eilish (first of all yes i know wow its billie eilish. yes i know i've seen the memes just hear me out) she says "it doesn't make you weak to ask for help," and i really believe that. if the pain is so bad there is nothing wrong with asking for help, even telling someone. don't think you're going to burden them because you aren't and it's not fair to you to keep this pain to yourself. if there is anyone you trust enough to talk to and really let then know your feelings you should. and there is never anything wrong with asking your parents to see a therapist or psychiatrist. please do that earlier then when it's almost too late. i made that mistake and i would never want someone to feel as though they have to wait for it to be so bad to justify going to a therapist or someone professional. you don't have to feel as though you need to justify your pain. i felt that way and i just wish anyone would have told me that. i have felt that sometimes nothing helps and this won't get better. i'd recommend trying to do something that you enjoy doing. whether it be video games or watching movies or reading you should do it. i've had no motivation to do the things i liked before and i have read that this is a sign of depression and i just want to say that you should try and do something you like. sometimes those short moments of happiness is worth the effort. for me it was playing destiny for hours on end. don't make it into a crazy obsession as there is always a limit to everything, but if it makes you happy do it. it does get better though, i promise. as for me i waited too late to ask for help but after getting a psychiatrist and a therapist i have gotten better. don't be like me and wait till it gets really bad to ask for help. ask for help when you think there's something wrong, not when you can't bear it anymore. i thought i'd try to help someone, anyone who is in the unfortunate dark place that i was in. i wish you the best of luck on your journey. it gets better. i know i keep saying that but i think it's important. never lose hope and keep fighting. ❤️	0

gunshot. "the sadness will last forever."this is quite edgy😅 but i dont consider myself that suicidal. but every now and then i have thoughts that my life is ending. when i listen to a certain song that conveys a melancholy emotion, i fantasize that i'm shot at the heart, killed in action. and i lay on the ground, my face lingered a remaining light, my youth is over. it's a beautiful way to die since i see this figuratively : my heart is too soft and big for this world, it had too much pain and being shot by a firearm symbolizes that it's excruciating than it ever was before. but then it's over. and people i know, especially my loved ones had anguish in their faces that i never wish upon them. loud cries feasting around. it seems like a beautiful way to die. as i take my last breath, i smiled weakly, my eyes losing its light, chanting something similar to van gogh's last words. "the sadness will last forever."	1
how do i(35f) tell my boyfriend (32m) my relationship with my best friend/ex-bf(35m) and family is non-negotiable? background: i broke up with my ex 7-8 years ago. sometime after our break up, my family abandoned me and left me alone and with a pile of credit card debt. during this time, him and his mom adopted me, helped me when i was depressed, cosigned loans, cooked for me, helped me out and basically the family i needed. i'm in a much better place now and we still keep in touch. i still call his mom regularly and she spoils me like her own daughter. now: i've met and fallen in love with a guy long distance and despite everything this might be it. but he has a policy of no friends with exes. in general he's not comfortable with either of us having opposite sex friends 🙄. i didn't think we'd make it this far but i'm starting to find i may want to spend the rest of my life with him. because i was a coward and wanted to avoid conflict i let the ex issue fall to the back burner. he's making plans to move towards me so we can take the next step forward. but i know this will come up and it'll be an ugly fight. so far the uanimous advice from my friends is if he asks me to cut ties to my ex and family out this is a deal breaker. i need to know how to bring it up to him without getting his defenses up and turning it into an all out fight. i do love the guy but it's hard to get him to understand this is my chosen family. also worth noting, he's not close with his family and has no friends he considers close friends. tl;dr: new boyfriend doesn't believe in friendships with exes. ex is more like family than ex-lover	0

i kinda like my body i'm not super chubby but im not like skinny either. i don't have super big boobs, i'm like a b cup. i don't have a super huge butt, she's a little bit above average. i have hip dips and that's kinda annoying but it's kinda cool because everyone thinks i'm flat until i turn around. i just like who i am. i used to see my chub and be like "i'm so fat ugh" and then i'd workout and cry. but that's not me. i am who i am and if it weren't for my fat i probably would've broken a bone when i get hit by a car. instead i walked away with a few bruises😌👍🏽that is all.	0

why do i always feel this wayso i'm definatly not on here for attention and i guess its more that i just need help or someone to talk to but man have i been having a tough time lately and it just seems like ill look back and just everything in my life seems like a big failure i go back to my youngest memories as a kid and even then i am like wow you were always at the bottom in life, i dont look bad either and im very outgoing and sociable too, some would even consider me to be the life of the party but man if these people spent a minute in my head theyd be in for a real shocker. i dont know what's wrong with me but i cant stop blaming myself hating myself and everything negative that goes with it and it seems like i don't have the willpower either to get ahead because i constantly feel like shit or when it starts getting good then boom something bad happens so its like this constant feeling of failure and it just makes me want to give up 😔 i don't actually want to commit suicide i just want to feel better and stop telling myself that i'm better to the world dead	1
subreddit suggestions? don't you hate it when you share what's really on your mind; how you're *really* feeling; and someone responds with generic-ass advice or tells you that you have no *right* to feel the way you feel? this had been happening to me a hella lot recently on reddit and i'm tired of it. i just want a place where people can share themselves, where fellow community members are *curious* about each others' lived experiences, rather than shutting them out or trying [poorly] to fix them. i know there are two ways of searching for what i want. it's the same as searching for 'ideal' empathetic people irl. you can try and find those who accept you because they've been the same places you've been, or you can try and find people who accept you just because they're accepting, non-judgmental people. (hard to come by.) the first method is what led me to r/lonely many moons ago...when every other outlet either scoffed at my feelings or bumbled about "how bout joining a club or org?", yall were actually here to *relate* and to *accept* my experience. it helped me feel less alone in my loneliness, and eventually break out of it--by getting to better understand myself from you people. now, i'm at a place with a different set of relational problems. and i've had no luck feeling accepted or related to on generic ones. so i'm asking for suggestions. either a sub with the same insanely specific problems i have (which i'll list soon), or an anything-goes type sub but where all the users make a pact not to assume, judge, or advice-give without similar experience. where everyone's basically acting like a person-centered therapist. first, let me describe what *hasn't* worked for me, including some deets about my sitch. - r/self was good to rant in for a minute, but (a) the comment section is chock full of advice-givers and judgers, and (b) the kind of posts that get traction on here are (sorry) well-written pity pleas. - r/lonely no longer applies to me, though it once was the shit to me. i'm not lonely anymore; i'm comfortable and loving in my solitude. and i've tried sharing my current shit there but it didn't resonate. - r/suicidewatch and r/depression are the other big players in this arena, as well as r/mentalhealth kind of, but are mostly full of people who believe they're worthless or similar. for me, this hasn't been the right place. i think pretty highly of myself and have big dreams, confidence in my abilities, think life is worth continuing to live, etc. - r/askreddit, r/doesanyoneelse, r/relationshipadvice are obviously full of a varied mix of people--extremely few of whom can actually relate to you but all of whom are jumping to tell you who's right and wrong in a given situation, or tell you you're a millennial loser, etc. now, the **other** route is to find a sub specific enough to 'click' with me, just as r/lonely once did. so lemme real quick try to summarize the main things that are important to me right now but which end up getting ostracized elsewhere. hopefully you'll be able to point me in a similar direction of any of these. - my family says they 'love' and 'care' about me, but it doesn't register with me *at all*. where outsiders look in and see a loving, caring family, all i feel is that they're annoying and asking too many unnecessary questions (in what comes across to me as a selfish way that doesn't respect the fact that i had literally no choice in being born unto them). - i've hidden most 'vulnerable' parts of my personality from my parents (and "friends") for as long as i remember. now, the only time i feel truly comfortable enough to be vulnerable is with myself. - by normal people's definitions, i basically don't 'care' about other people--if caring is defined as feeling compelled to reach out regularly, ask questions, stay up-to-date/catch up. i don't, and that isn't in itself a problem, but it *causes* problems. for example i have literally no inclination to check in on my sister to hear about her life, or on my old high school teachers who apparently miss me a ton, or on my old club 'friends', etc., and the grapevine informs me that my lack of interest hurts them. but i'm just not interested in any of their lives; i feel nothing. so? :) thanks everyone if you took the time to get to the bottom of this megapost. i'll appreciate any kinda response. or if you just wanna dm me and talk about something unrelated, that too. i've been flailing around random subs for a while getting rejected and figured i need to just take a step back and assess who i should really be sharing with, rather than getting consistently shot down. so here's my attempt. be well everybody 🌺	0

my boyfriend (m23) is going away alone on my dream holiday (f19) when we already had prior plans. and more.. tldr; my bf and i made plans to go to paris this summer after his month long uni trip. he has ditched those plans to go to tokyo, and then america totally alone & without me, and didn't include me in his decision. oh and we are meant to be saving for moving out. okay now for the longer version: my partner and i have been together for 14 months now, we have been to japan together once, but we went with a group of other people so we have never gone on a couples holiday. he is going on a university trip to south africa, and will be gone for a month with no wifi or form of communication (no problem with this it's mandatory🥰) we both agreed that when he got back, instead of going to japan we would go on a small trip to paris for a weekend as it would cost only a fraction of what japan costs, and then we could save up again for next year. he suddenly popped on me out of the blue that he was going to go to japan in august, on the dates we had planned for paris and then some, because that's when comiket is on (a convention he knows i have always wanted to go to). he then also announced that after japan, he would be taking another expensive trip to america! we are meant to be saving up to move into a house share, as we are currently living in unstable circumstances. he is unemployed (although searching for a job), and is using all of his student loan on all these trips (sa, japan and usa) and also buying lots of photography equipment that he does not need and we really can't afford the extra cost right now. i'm not only upset that our holiday is now off the boards, and that he's going to my favourite place on earth. i will now barely see him for 2 months straight in the summer, and i'm terrified that either we won't be able to move out, or i'll be stuck shouldering all the rent, bills, and food, as he's spent all his money. also note he is doing all of this totally alone. if something were to happen there would be nobody to help him. am i being unreasonable here? i feel really selfish and possessive.. i don't want to tell him not to go, but i really don't want him to. for several reasons. what do i do in this situation!	0

i don't care what anyone says.... there's only one winner in russian roulette. i'm so tired of fighting my demons from day to day. i wanna be that winner for once. but after my last massive suicide attempt in 2016, i made a stupid fucking promise to my family that i wouldn't attempt to take my life again because i watched my family shatter. now i regret that promise and all i think about is ending this joke i call a life. i'm so done. what do i do about this stupid promise? i don't know how much longer i can keep it!!! 😭	1

yo, need girl help i'm pretty sad, as i got left on read twice by the girl i like. i messaged her last week and we had a pretty good convo, that wasn't one sided. her responses were higher quality than mine, if anything. she left me on read three days ago. i followed up with "what's good?" two days ago and got left on read. she seems polite and her responses were good so why/ did i get ghosted? i responded pretty fast sometimes but other times i'd wait a few hours. maybe i was too needy? just would like anyone's opinion. thanks 😔	0
my parents don't belive in covid and being at home with them and not saying anything is getting very frustrating. my mom got angry the other day, because they had a new policy at their work that they have to wear masks from now on and my mom came home and had a field day about it in the middle of the kitchen and i just stayed quiet, but she asked my thoughts about it and i said 'well i think they should've been mandatory for a while now.' and she explained to me that the virus isn't real and that the flu is more dangerous. and my step dad agreed, and i just looked at them, like 'are you guys virus deny-ers?'. and they said 'yes.' ! and they make a comment about it everyday and i just keep quiet cause i figured why bother fighting with them, i could never change their views about anything so it would be useless. and today my step dad joked about getting covid and my mom said. 'at least i would actually see someone who got the virus and i wouldn't be a virus deny-er.' - she said kinda mocking me. and i said 'maybe because all the people who are in a critical condition are in the hospital and not on the streets or at the grocery store.' and they just brushed it off. it's getting very frustrating. 🙂 i really wonder where they get their news from.	0
failing to prepare for the holidays so some background, i live with my girlfriend who doesn't know much about christmas, in a country unfamiliar to both of us (we are studying in germany) and we have a really small fridge. we were supposed to go shopping earlier today (24th) to get our food for the upcoming 2 days. however i am sick and kept sleeping till around 3pm which is when most stores closed and busses stopped. my girlfriend just didn't think they were gonna close, idk. well now we have nothing, i am really hungry and it's barely 4pm. on top of that i am really sick and assuming that not eating is not going to help heal that. 😶 man mucus going down my throat into my stomach makes me really sick on an empty stomach. i did truly fuck up today. merry christmas everyone and appreciate the food on the table 😀. is something open in germany, the netherlands or belgium? 25 and 26 december? tl;dr failed to go shopping, will have a forced fast on christmas eve and the two following days	0
i forgot my gym shirt 😀 i have to do gym in my shirt which is one of those shirts you'd never wear unless you have nothing else to wear. it's low cut, short sleeved and shoes my bra so i'm gonna go die now. im wearing a hoodie over it currently but i can't wear a hoodie to gym. then after school, i have dance and that's going to be even worse without a gym shirt. on monday, my dance teacher told me to go out and buy some more gym shirts (which i didn't do and was planning on wearing an old one) because i only have one.	0

(advice needed) to the person i'm hopelessly in love with. (23f) this is kind of a weird situation and idk if i should go for it or leave it as it is. so we are both females and 5 years apart, i'm the younger one. we see each other twice a week because of work and we've known each other for about a year and i've come to be very fond of her presence but the way she acts confuses me 😢 so let me just explain it. she's usually very humorous and loves to joke around whether it's with me or other coworkers, but in general everyone at work is very friendly and loves to joke around. she sometimes says she "really likes me" when i say i don't like her or when i do simple favors for her but when i say i really like her she says she "doesn't like me" so i'm like *in my mind* please tell me how you really feel. anyways, usually we touch hands or brush against each other throughout the day and sometimes make eye contact but i'm usually the one initiating it. so yesterday she was doing something and i scared her from behind and she told me "don't scare me like that, i'm thinking about something" and i go on to ask "thinking about what?" and she pointed at me but after that she says "i'm joking" but i noticed that she blushed a little and i think she noticed that i was a little disappointed in her saying that she was joking but she goes on to add "why would i be thinking of you, are you my boyfriend or girlfriend?". also keep in mind where we work is really chill, everyone is very outgoing. so at night all of our coworkers and us usually go to our break room to wait to close the store and i sat next to her and i didn't make any kind of interest in talking to her so she nudged me and idk it just happened. we then start a little conversation and joke around about irrelevant things and i get really close to her and she seems to not mind it. she then goes on to tell me to move a little so she can sleep on my lap in front of all our coworkers and i'm like ahh ok then if you want to. (it's a little unprofessionally but) then idk what came to me but i just started playing with her hair and she didn't seem to mind since she was on her phone and so was i. then once we were finally about to close and go home she tells me "i'm sorry but i like a guy" in a joking way and i simply responded "its fine" but her actions tell me otherwise!! i don't know if she's just treating me as a very good friend or she's just rejecting the emotions she's feeling. also something that happened recently was that i texted her about something and then i followed with "thank you, love you so much" and she simply replied with "💋" and it's been on the back of my mind since then ...and the thing is she's gonna be moving to new york in the summer and she's not going to come back most likely unless she has a reason to stay so i really need help on what to do and what you guys think she's feeling. i'm sorry if this bored you in anyway. 💔😅 tl;dr i've fallen in love with a girl that i don't know whether she likes me back or not and she's been on my mind for quite a while and it's driving me insane.	0

it's not a huge achievement in reality, but i got my first article published in an actual physical newspaper! this semester of college i got involved with the paper since i'm a journalism major, and it's been really fulfilling so far! this week was print week and i just so happened to be assigned to write about an art gallery on campus for this week's edition. considering it was just a matter of timing and coincidence, it's not something really big, but it still feels like a big first step in what i hope to make a career out of. i mean, come on, i'm in the paper! here's to a new year and a new me! ✌️	0

feeling ready to go not quite sure how to start this off as i never thought i would end up writing on here myself, not because i've never had these thoughts myself, but because i didn't want anyone to have to see me this way. i grew up alone, had a loving family and wonderful parents who i will appreciate forever, but i lost everyone else around me over and over as we moved around and eventually i think that it got to me, can't imagine it wouldn't for most people. both my mum and dad had backgrounds in mental health, my father was a counselor while he taught at a college and my mother chose to go back to university to study it after she realized she didn't want to teach maths anymore, and i developed an affinity for the subject over the years. and these things combined led me to the decision that, if i had to go through all this, carry this pain, i would at least try to take as much of it away from those around me. i tried to be someone who would give as much love to the people who needed it, so that they could pass it on in the future. i still lost a lot of them eventually, but i believed and hoped i had made a difference, helped them feel less alone and taken some of their pain away. i've done this for years, and i'm proud of the person i chose to be, and the things i did. but i feel it now, feel that eventually i won't have any more love left to share. ive never been able to forget anything, and it has been a long time now. i want anyone who reads this to know, im not afraid of this, i think i knew it would happen and somehow, ive made my peace. i'm not there yet, but i want to leave something behind for the people who may find this someday. please try to share some love with others, the world needs it, and i hope i did a good job in the years ive been a part of it. i love you all, i hope you share it with others some day 💓	1

going to a new place to get hair cut before telling you the whole story i need to say that i had long hair for the past 4 years and didn't cut it, just bimonthly 2 cm trims. so i've been waiting to get layers for a while. i just felt my hair needs a little change. not lengthwise just more layers. and i tried to go where i usually go but the woman wasn't free so today i was in the mall and saw this place and stupid me said let's go here, nothing bad is going to happen. (i'm pretty horrified of haircuts in general) i told the man who came to do my hair about 10 times i want the same length and just layers and showed photos too. he just said layers, yeah and i thought to myself, ok he got it, and within 5 seconds i realized my hair is a little under my shoulder. turns put the guy didn't speak english. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i was pissed and started crying for the rest of the haircut. i have not stopped crying all evening and anytime i see short hair i can't help but to ask myself did this really happen??? to add insult to the injury my wedding is also in a few months. i absolutely hate myself and how i look. my hair was me and now it's gone. tl;dr. i fucked up my hair by going to a new place to get a haircut. <url>	0

not changing the time on my phone so this happened this morning. i live in the uk and yesterday i returned from my holidays in spain. this will take a huge role in this story. this morning i wake up as normal, around 7am. i eat my breakfast, prepare the food for the day and then change my clothes. then i grab my bike and i am ready to go!! once i am outside i notice that is dark af. normally you would get some light from the sun at that time, but today was different. i thought "ok maybe as i've been away 3 weeks the sunrise will start a bit later now?" i don't know why but it made sense in my head. on my way to work i notice that the streets are empty, with barely no people or cars. then i think "well i guess everyone is on holidays still". so after 30min of peaceful cycling i arrive at my office. i get inside and i can't see any of my coworkers. i think to myself, "well that's good because i am few minutes late, but where the hell is everyone?" so i go to reception and ask "where the hell is everyone"? they say, "dude you are a bit early don't you think?" and i am like "look at my phone is 8:30 i am not early". then they show me their time and... fuck apparently my phone didn't change the time yesterday so instead of waking up at 7 i woke up at 6, and instead of arriving at the office at 8:30 i arrived at 7:30. now everything makes sense 🤦‍♂️ tl;dr my phone didn't change the time so i arrived at work an hour earlier making the whole morning really confusing	0
i got banned from a discord server due to pedophilia **to clarify:** i did not "groom" or did any act that would fall to the same category as it. i am a underage individual and i know this isn't a topic i should joke about but still, yeah. sorry for my bad england, on mobile etc. you know the drill. so i was in a roleplay server on discord, doing casual stuff and fooling around. i was known as the "horny guy" for some obvious reasons, i got my first warning on day one due to sexual content (which was just some horrible copypastas), i wasn't serious at almost any moment. you got the picture. so a converisation started between 2 guys as a joke that a character was a child and to act appropriate around him. so the conversation was going and i decided to bomb it with my great humor: this guy: you know he is a child right me: fine for me this guy: kiddy cummer gtfo me: kiddy tiddies 🥵 as dumb i am, i decided to leave the message there. 10 minutes later, my friend pings me on another discord: friend: well done me: well done what? friend: you managed to get banned due to pedophilia now everything hit me at that moment, but i couldn't help but to laugh my ass off due to the events, getting banned from a wholesome roleplay server on day 4 due to pedophilia. tl;dr: got banned from a discord server for writing "kiddy tiddies 🥵" now if you read so far you are free to judge me. thank you.	0

confessing my feelings to my fwb, for the second time. hello reddit! this thing on? haha. ok, so a little about me. i'm a 20-something male living in southern california. i'm a freelance graphic designer (not very successful) and work at a casino in their buffet as a dishwasher. this is going to be long and i'm typing this on my phone, so i apologise in advance. we met in summer of 2017 for the first time, very briefly, and didn't say much. she was with her boyfriend at the time, some d-bag who would eventually break her heart multiple times. we met at a bar, her favorite bar, on her birthday. all i can really remember is her crazy black hair and a white t-shirt with rainbow stripes across the chest and thinking "she's waaay out of my league". we said 'hi' i slinked off to hang with my friends in the back and after that we wouldnt see eachother for another year and a half. in our circle of friends we knew her as a massive cutie, who went by a particular nintendo character's name, so she was easy to remember and i thought she was more attractive for it somehow. i wasn't apart of the original group of friends that basically knew her from grade school, but her name would pop up in convos from time to time. i would constantly joke with my friends on setting me up with her and they would tell me how she's head over heels for her man. i concede and would say "well maybe if she ever breaks up" or "well that sucks", and go on with my life. over the next year and a half, a whole lot of shit happened in my life. i got in and out of a weird okcupid relationship, i was overwhelmed with full-time school and work and helping out my ill mother, which eventually lead to me losing my job, and then my mother passed away after having just helped her pay off debt with money i used from my tax return that was meant to keep me afloat until i could find a new job. i also had an awkward fling with a highschool crush after that. i was a complete mess. after losing my apartment and essentially couch surfing at my friend's parent's place for months i'm invited to a pool party, september of 2018. this pool party was to commemorate my other friend for having just moved into a new apartment. but guess who happened to be there, somewhat happily single, and totally hitting on me the whole time? the girl from last year. the girl i had a little crush on because of her wild hair, wide hips and cool name. it seemed too good to be true. it was kindve cute how we were just messing with the boogie boards, she was asking how i could balance so easily on top of the board. i tried playing cool and would hit any flirting she did right back to her with ease; we would bounce off each other like it was nothing. i swear i never had this much chemistry with anyone based on nothing. so the pool party went on, we all got drunk, and i had work in the morning. everything that would've happened in a movie happened that night. cheeky witty beer pong, her playing with my hair while we all played super smash bros and right before i leave for my lyft home-she asks for my number. i was in. we would text back and forth. i would get anxious, we would talk day after day about nothing. she pops the question. she wanted to have fun, but as friends, non-exclusive. her reason "exclusivity leads to falling in love, and i don't want to break your heart"-her exact words. my lack of foresight and eagerness to please this woman made me agree. why not? i had plenty of fwb situations, never gotten attached. she spends the night a few times at my friend's parent's place. they have an extension under the house that's like a mini apartment where my friend's brother lives, i slept on an air mattress in his living room sometimes. i'm surprised anyone would even consider hooking up with a homeless man and yet here we are. she brings 4loko and tequila and we don't do anything. i feel lame, i didnt make a move, i think its over. but she still kept interest in me and we continued to text. the next week we go out to a live reggae performance at a local bar/club. its kindve perfect. we pre-gamed and shot the shit for an hour, talked about art and relationships and just anything, before going in. the music was chill, she's swaying and it's perfection. i move in close. she moves in closer. we're rocking and she's "impressed that i have rhythm". we uber to the place i'm staying and fall asleep on the air mattress. nothing but in the morning i make her breakfast and we cuddle. the next time i see her she's coming up from the border helping her friends move. they flake on her and she hits me up. everyone's asleep and its like 1am. she needs a place to crash. i oblige and i do nothing. shes giving me all the hints and me, trying to be a gentleman, i dont make a move. i stay up playing video games, she's asleep. i play into the morning and she wakes up. she makes fun of me for not making a move and playing video games. but then i make a move. let me just say this first time was comical, but also amazing. we had to keep quiet. it was instinctual. we moved to the bathroom and then back to the air mattress. she orgasms multiple times, but i don't (absolutely weird). we decide on a spontaneous trip to the beach for pizza. tequila and squirt in a canteen and good vibes. this is my favorite morning. all the while in between the 1-on-1 days i'm hanging out with her family, with her kids (not the her recent ex's kids btw, she had two previous relationships before him) and with her. i get invested subconsciously. i don't want a relationship with anyone at this point. but i'm enjoying the hell out of this. her family isnt perfect but neither was mine, yet i basked in the arguments and the banter. i come over one night before a graveshift at my new job. somber, everyone's up and getting ready for the dinner i was invited to. dim lighting and a cramped kitchen with tortillas cooking. its almost time for me to leave, the food is delicious. she suggests we take a nap until i have to go. and that was the second time. pitch black, in the bedroom, she finishes, i finish, but it takes so long for me. i enjoyed myself but in hindsight its like an omen. not ejaculating has correlated to about one other relationship i had that ended awkwardly, but i digress. a few days later we hangout. its my weekend and i text her if she and her daughter would like to meet for breakfast. i also offer to pay for everything. the denny's we go to is closed, so we settle on ihop. her daughter gets the chocolate chip pancakes and i get waffles, i forget what my fwb had ordered. our conversation kindve turns into something gloomy. relationships are discussed and i basically try and cover up my emotions and say if she moved on i would be okay. but i was lying to myself and to her. iirc the next day i accompany her on her trip to her vocational school, just to keep her company and see her off. we kiss goodbye. it hits me that i don't do this with fwbs. i start getting anxious. i stay up all day thinking, maybe i do like like her, maybe this is a real thing? trying to get some hours of sleep for my graveshift, i wake up to a text. "we need to talk". my blood turns cold. she's getting back with her ex. i try and say my peace and just send way too many texts and messages to her. after all the back and forth and reminding her how toxic she said he was and me confessing basically for the first time, i leave off on "i still want to be friends, i just want you to be happy" or something along those lines. this had to be like october of 2018. just a month of getting to know her and texting and hanging with her family. i was absolutely heartbroken in record time. i blamed it on me grieving for my mom, but maybe i'm just an emotional person. and i hate myself for it. the next couple of months i wrote poetry, because that's what she liked to do. i deleted all my pictures off of instagram, just over 1000, one by one. none of them had anything to do with her. we never took pictures together. our chill as fuck friends with benefits moment was just a blip compared to my previous relationships (2 committed and 3 casual). i crawled back to a previous fwb. i felt pretty pathetic. fast forward to february 2019. i post a vague depressing story on instagram and guess who dms me? she asks "need a friend?", and me being me i was like "yeah sure i'm lonely as fuck and need an excuse to leave the house". to my knowledge we were just going to hangout and she was still with her bf. not long into the day she lets me know. they broke up. he proved to be toxic. she chose to hit me up the day after she moved out of his place. i chuckle at the news. i'm confused. this shit doesn't happen. i'm staying chill. i won't let it happen again. we hangout, we cook breakfast together. we hangout more, go to her favorite bar, have crazy conversations with random people, she leans on me and into my lap. we spend time with her kids and family. i join her at her orientation to her externship. she asks if i can claim her kids to help her out, i say "sure" (it doesnt get that far and i don't think i would've qualified). we do it for the third time in the laundry mat downstairs from her family's place she's staying at. and wouldn't you know, i dont finish. an absolute omen. i'm cursed and full of bad decisions. i'm deep in my thoughts. i'm genuinely confused as to why she would seek me out. its distracting me at work so i have to clarify how i feel. and let me tell you this is the worst time to confess, again. i've learned that the quickest way to be placed on the "hard no" list is to confess your love to someone heartbroken and make them feel pressured, unintentional or not. i tell her how much i care about her and her family. how much i love her and would love to be like a step dad and shit (yeah i'm an aries scorpio cancer, so take that as you will). and how i'm still cool with being friends either way. but text is a horrible medium in my experience. tone and intent are not so cut and dry. she takes it badly. she feels like i'm forcing her to like me, and that she never will because she would've fallen by now if it was possible. even though i tried my best to just express my feelings and made a point to mention to her how i'm cool with just keeping it casual. she says i'm an awesome guy but she needs space. i text "i'm sorry. i hope you have a good day."and she texts back "i'm sorry too, [name redacted]". that was today. today i'm heartbroken, again. today i fucked up something that wasn't supposed to be complicated. but hopefully tomorrow i can heal, learn and just move on. posted here to vent and just get over it. thank you for reading reddit 👋🏽 tl;dr i accidentally pressured my fwb by confessing my love for her for the second time and pushed her away. after she came back to me for support and to continue our fwb thing.	0
i just got a new kitty, and am looking for some name suggestions! what do you folks think? i got a new kitty about a month ago, and i was smitten from the moment she climbed up on my shoulders to take a nap. then i found out they named the whole litter after beers and knew that she was perfect for me! her name is ale, but that just doesn't quite roll off the tongue well enough for me.. [here](<url>) she is in all her glory, with her older brother joules (because she's orange and my dad's an electrician and hates cats! 😜) what would be a fitting name for my baby?	0

i've been having random cringe attacks remembering a wedding i went to 3 years ago so for context, i'm a trans woman and came out and started transitioning four years ago. (this is relevant) for the last couple of months, i've been randomly remembering a specific moment in a friend's wedding 3 years ago. i'd only been to one wedding before coming out, and things are much more complicated for women than men at weddings, so i was pretty ignorant of good 'lady guest at a wedding' etiquette. now, i didn't wear a white dress or something. i knew that much. but i thought it was normal to get super dressed up for weddings, so i paid to have my makeup done. all the other women there just had a regular full face (which looks much different from the full face and sort of dramatic makeup i had done), but i didn't really notice it. and then the wedding happened and i congratulated the bride after the dancing, and she looked at me and made a comment about how nice and done up my makeup was. i didn't catch it at the moment, but a couple months ago i remembered it and realised she was making a passive-aggressive comment about me having my makeup done up more than she did, and now i keep randomly remembering that moment and cringing internally. it's not like, a huge deal, but it has been a miniature torment for me these months. i wish i could go back in time and just tell younger me to go to the wedding like a regular person 🙃 anyways. wanted to share that somewhere. thanks for reading. would appreciate it if you shared painful awkward memories too! :)	0
being gay sucks "no pun intended" i'm a sophomore now and i go to a school in nebraska that's fairly small and full of bigoted people, and even though i'm out as gay i'm scared to dress the way i'd like or act the way i'd like because people here are very judgmental, and because of where i live and the circumstances i also feel very lonely, and like i'm not going to find a boyfriend who i can share intimacy with. since i've moved out here i haven't had that feeling and i'm really close to just ending it. i miss my boyfriend but i had to leave him due to moving and i don't know what to do. i've never been this depressed and i'm so close to just ending it so i need to make it clear that i love you all❤️	0

i just took a selfie for the first time in years! ok, that sounds... lame and boring, but i feel happy about it. my self esteem has been super low years, so bad i do not want to be in any pictures, because i feel like i look so ugly and disgusting and hate to look at myself, so i don't really like mirrors either that much. but i just took a selfie and actually feel like it looks decent! not the greatest, but... it's alright, and that makes me happy. might just be because i'm tired but can't go to sleep because i have too much stuff to do. and yeah, i tend to over-celebrate even the smallest of things quite often 😅	0

gf [25] of 14 month has been hiding flirty messages from me [29 m] my gf has for the past week been getting flirty and loving messages from someone that she has a lot of mutual friends with. they met ages ago because he was dating one of her friends. a month ago she changedb her profile picture on fb, which is when he suddenly messaged after no contact for a couple of years. he was friendly to start with then started calling her cute and asked her out for drinks. she told him she was seeing someone and he stopped his advances. she currently can't talk often to her close friends because they've moved abroad for studies/work. so she's carried on talking to him. i don't care/mind because it is purely talking. they're talking about what happened with his ex, drama with that old friend group, etc. it seemed like a good friendship and gave her someone outside of us she can talk to as a friend. last week he started sending flirty messages (she told me that's when it started). i don't know how they started but i saw messages from the last couple of days with him sending messages such as "goodnight sweetie ❤️😘", calling her cute again, you get it. i didn't intend to see it but went on her phone to grab a photo and send to myself. went onto messenger to send it and his chat was already up. saw the goodnight message and obviously had to check at that stage. she was in the bathroom and knew i was on her phone. the thing is, when he first hit on her, she told me. we have told each other everything up until this point. she knows i would have been annoyed he crossed that line again but would have asked what happened after. she didn't shoot him down but replied "night". she wasn't flirty back in the last few days. i asked her why she didn't stop him and it's because she needs a friend and she was afraid he would ghost her. i told her that if he ghosted her he wouldn't be much of a friend anyway. i also asked why she didn't tell me and her reply was that she didn't want to hurt me. i explained that the fact that she hid it from me hurts more because it's hard not to suspect anything else. she's apologised but it still feels crap. her phone is an open book (as is mine) so i can always check anything else, but i don't want to be that guy. i just want some advice on how to handle this. any stories from the past that you may be willing to share. tl;dr: caught flirty messages off another guy on my gfs phone. she was hiding it from me but not being flirty back	0
i was thinking when a cure for death old age and a solid control on illness is created, like all things i.e. medication, it likely won't work in everyone . so i wonder what the consequence of this would be. 🤔 like would they separate the types of people or what ? ( like different schools different careers ) and would the ones likely to live a long time ever marry the ones likely to die in the century or would they rather not do that to them selves .	0
ruining my co-worker's food this happened last friday, but i didn't realize what i had done until today. i work in a small doctor's office that's pretty much run by three of us, plus the doctor. as you can imagine, things get a little hectic if a person is missing, as the workload for everyone else increases. last friday was supposed to be a chill day. we didn't have any patients, and usually on no-patient days, my two co-workers leave, and i can play wow in my office. not this time. for some reason it was busy as fuck. the phone wouldn't stop ringing, and people were walking in off the street to schedule appointments. it was exhausting, but i lived! finally it's 5:00. i went to grab my water bottle from the fridge, and for some reason when i opened the door, black bean salsa spilled all over the carpet. my annoying, bitchy co-worker likes to set things in the fridge without a lid. i was pissed. my whole week had already been stressful, and i didn't need this shit too. i didn't know the best way to get salsa off of carpet, so i grabbed medical gloves, and scooped all the salsa back in the container and put a lid on it. i was just about to throw it away, when i heard a noise up front. fuck. i forgot to lock the door and a patient came in asking to schedule an appointment. i dealt with them for 35 minutes because they had me looking up what benefits they had with their insurance (not my job). when they left, i sprinted to the door and locked it. then i went to the break room, grabbed my backpack, my water bottle, and put the salsa in the fridge. today during lunch, my annoying co-worker is eating chips, and i hear her make a retching sound. i looked over and she spit out a chip with decent sized hairball on it. my jaw dropped. i fucking scraped the salsa off of the carpet and put it back in the fridge without thinking. she started looking through the salsa, and there was a bunch of little hairs in it. she freaked out and called the grocery store she bought it from to complain about hairs in the salsa. i felt terrible! i reeeeeaaaally don't like that co-worker, but i would never purposely fuck with someone's food 🤦 tldr: in a rush, i accidentally dropped my co-worker's salsa on the carpet, and put it back in the fridge	0

pervert. there is me [under 18 male] and a girl [under 18 female] ok, so i am in middle school to start this off... (i know that relationships in school aren't like ones when you're an adult) (also on mobile and don't know how to format) this happened today. so i've liked this one girl for a while, she's in a few of my classes and stuff like that. i liked her for months now and my friends questioned me. i gave hints and they got it. so we have a weird schedule this week because we have a bunch of field trips and half the class is gone because of that. in another class, a group of girls found out. they started spreading it (by yelling) and she found out. but there is a few morons that sit in my lunch table. they always go like "i saw you looking up her shorts" stuff like that. i say no and move along. well....... when the moron heard that, he told her. he told her everything but before that.... everyone said "omg she likes you too" so i was pretty proud he says that i look up her gym shorts (we don't have the same gym period so no.) and i get a text on snapchat. here's how it goes over half an hour(starting out with "her") "do you like me?" "obviously. you saw the halls didn't you?" "you're f****** disgusting" "what?" "you're such a pervert" "??" "your friends at ur lunch table told me" "told you what" "you look up my shorts.... and i saw you had a binder in class" "um no" "it was the whole table" "they're messing with you" at this point i am feeling my heart just.... die "ok but what about that boner?" i wasn't thinking straight and didn't see the obvious. "uh... sorry for being a boy they can go up randomly" she leaves me on read. then blocks me i definitely know that these accusations are false. someone told me that she posted on her story "wow we love pervs🙄" ok. i really liked her, she was pretty, laugh at my jokes and stuff like that. her friends were really excited when they found out, well they probably won't be tomorrow. one of my friends that is the girls neighbor and are pretty close (i think) that wasn't here agreed with me. he said that when he comes back when he gets better (get well soon) he will tell her the truth. i didn't do none of that stuff and she ate it all up. tl;dr: my crush found out that i like her, she likes me back until a moron says that i looked up her shorts and had a boner. she ends up blocking me. do you ever think she will like me again? see how fast girls jump to conclusions😂 will update if anything interesting happens	0

i feel so hurt i just want to die.the only think stopping me is i'm too scared of the pain moments before it. but i hate myself. i feel like no one cares about me outside of my family, and though i'm never bullied i never feel value. girls only look at me because i'm an attractive guy but then inside i feel lame as hell. once they see that i'm quickly left in the dust. my friends rarely if ever reach out to me first, i always feel like i'm keeping these relationships going. i feel exhausted and i'm only 19. i want to go back to when i was a kid. i feel like now i'll get a burst of attention and feel loved and then i'll be left in the dust. whenever i struggle it seems no one cares and it's me vs the world. i don't want these feelings. i think the worst thing right now is not having a textbook best friend, i've always wanted one but i don't. i try, but i'm growing so tired no one understands. everyone just says make more effort to give love but i'm getting so so tired🥺... if there was a painless way to die i'd do it right now except for the fact that my family would be devastated. crap, thinking of that just makes me feel sadder and cornered, i feel like i can't escape. i can't afford a therapist and even if i could i don't want people to know my struggle... everyone sees me as the handsome, tall, kind friendly guy.	1
got ghosted so slept with someone else. now she replied so i met a girl in a foreign city 3 months ago and we went for drinks together and had a great time, ever since had been talking daily. a couple of weeks ago we even went back to the same city for a weekend (we're both not from that country) and it went really well i felt. last week she started acting a little quieter and she said she was just busy with work. she ignored a message a few days later asking how her day was and then the next day i sent another let me know when she's free so i could call as i didn't want to just be on text. she responded saying "sure i'll let you know when i'm done at work 😘". cue ghosting 👻. she didn't go on whatsapp (but i know she still gets notifications so could read the messages). at this point though i wasn't sure if she had actually been in an accident or ghosted me. so i sent her a text the next day and said is "is everything alright?" - no reply a day later i then remembered she used another chat app and checked if she had been online.... there it was "online now", so now i'm almost certain i'm being ghosted at this point and reading everyone else's experiences this seemed standard mo of a ghoster . i give it another day and sent her one last message being like "hey i really don't know what to think here except that your no longer interested, i of course understand if that's how you feel even if it sucks and i'd appreciate being told if that was the case rather than just disappearing" - no reply again so at this point i'm kinda hurt and pissed off and i had a shitty week already, so i re download tinder which i had deleted a couple of months before because i really liked her and had no interest in other girls. i matched pretty quickly with a cute girl travelling in my city and she asked to meet up. i did and we had fund and ended up sleeping together, in perfect timing girl a sends me a message saying she's " really sorry for disappearing and needed time away from her phone and it has nothing todo with me and that she knows it was wrong" and then says a really vague statement saying "she can't explain it but the problem doesn't make sense and hope i can accept that " to be fair this girl is the sweetest girl i've met in a long time and i think she was genuinely with her family but she was clearly with her phone. i feel really bad for sleeping with someone. i'm yet to reply her but i also don't know wether is should feel like i've done anything wrong? and if so what should i do? reddit give me some advice please 🙏 tl;dr got ghosted and slept with another girl, then she replied saying ghosting had nothing to do with me.	0
boyfriend (28) wants me (25) to move in with him but doesn't have a job. posted by[u/batcat1394](<url>)[just now](<url>) ## boyfriend wants me to move in with him but doesn't have a job. 📷[**personal issues**](<url>) ## boyfriend (27) wants me (25) to move in with him but doesn't have a job. my partner (27) and i (25) have been together for 3 years. he lives in a 2 bedroom apartment still because his roommate moved out last summer. i live alone in a different part of town. we spend most of our time together, but this would be the first time for both of us living with a partner. he has been out of work for 2 years now and is living out of his savings. i have been making so many compromises when it comes to living together. moving out of an area of town i really like, living in his current apartment that i don't love, so that we can build a foundation together and find a better place 6 months down the line. i want us to be secure within ourselves before we take this huge step and commitment. i told him recently that i would not be willing to break my lease unless he has individual income and stability. he seemed like this was a shock. the reality is, i don't think it is a good idea in any sense to move in with someone, regardless of the relationship, unless all parties are financially stable. i feel that i am being perfectly reasonable, but he seems defensive and up in arms about this, to the point where he makes me feel guilty about it. why could they be getting so defensive when i set this boundary? does being financially stable and independent before living together seem like an unreasonable request? how can i stand my ground if he gets upset about this and help him to see that this takes 2 people to compromise. thank you all so much for you help. **tl;dr;** : boyfriend wants to live together but doesn't have a job.	0
tv series death brought back suicidal feelingshi guys, im 14f and i have been battling depression and severe anxiety since i was about 9 years old. i recently finished watching 13 reasons why because i was finally in a good headspace and thought i could handle it. i was wrong. my favorite character died in the last episode. i felt such a close connection and loved a character who never even rlly existed, but his death felt so real and was jam packed with emotions strong enough to make anyone cry. im heartbroken, and everytime i think about it, burst into tears. i recently found myself thinking heavily on death, and how much i wish that i could just get sick and slowly die. its a shame, i was honestly doing so much better and everyone was so proud of me.. im hopeless right now. any and every piece of advice is highly appreciated 🤍	1

almost getting scammed !! i am 17, i received the iphone 5c as a graduation present, 1 week later, i was taking a nap and i kept getting phone calls so i answered. an indian dude told me that i had to fix my computer and my computer is all fuked up so i was like "whatever i just want him to stop calling me" so i gave him the code to my computer which was very stupid. he was scrolling i my computer and i was thinking i made a huge mistake. the guy could not speak english well enough for me to understand what he was saying most of the time. when i listened carefully, i could hear some recorded voices in the background which made me realize this isn't someone trying to fix my computer. he went to a website on my computer and told me to put my credit information to buy a plan to fix my computer, i then realized this was a scam and i hung up. i was reluctant to believe this could happen to me since i had the new phone for 1 week. three weeks later, my brother randomly says to me " bro i saw a funny youtube video of someone trolling indian scammers, come watch". the indian guy in the video was saying the same stuff that he did to me! my soul jumped out of my body when i saw that. my brother them explained to me the description of the scam and it matched everything that had happened to me so i was freaked the hell out. two months later, i haven't touched my computer and i don't know what to do about giving the guy my computer code. 😱😩😩	0
i [20f] found whisper posts on my boyfriends [26m] profile that have hurt me pretty badly. i'm not sure what to do.. long read, tl:dr will be at the bottom on mobile, so sorry for formatting, me and my boyfriend have been together for about 2 and a half years. he's always been a bit protective about his phone but would usually hand it to me pretty quickly when i asked to use it. i never felt the need to go through anything of his cause i never doubted him for a second. we had plenty of little arguments here and there but i always felt like we came out stronger. these past few weeks have been very difficult for me and have pretty much been the worst of my whole life. i feel like we've been growing apart and even though we're under the same roof i still feel very very lonely constantly. i'm honestly pretty stressed out about this whole ordeal. i've been thinking about it and have not been able to sleep all night because of it. the main reason i was snooping his posts anyway was because he let slip in an argument that he posted about me being an asshole "all the time" on whisper. this argument was had while we were laying in bed about to go to sleep tonight, and it only started when i was jokingly going through his messenger and asking why he hadn't told me about a conversation. i instantly knew what day he was talking about when he called me an asshole. i had just drove 2 hours back into town from a very emotional funeral i had attended last thursday. i left early because i had an excruciating pain coming from my tailbone and just wanted to soak in a bath. i didn't have my house keys that day because i had taken my mother's car and had no way of getting inside besides contacting him to unlock the door. before i had actually left to head home he told me he would be taking a nap, so i figured the best way to reach him was to call because he always had his phone with him, and on vibrate at least. i reached the front door and called, no answer. no big deal, he's groggy and just couldn't reach it in time. i call again and no answer. i listen for a minute at the front door and hear his voice. i can tell he has his headset on and he's playing apex with his friends. i keep calling and actually start banging on the door also at this point because i know he's awake now and he should notice either one sooner or later, i just want to get inside. i hear him say to his friend about "hearing the banging" and "yep 5 missed calls". so i quit banging and calling cause i know he's coming to the door now. he unlocks it without opening it completely, not even a hello, or a kiss for the girlfriend, just runs back to the room to continue the match. my feelings were admittedly hurt because i had already gone through an emotional day and he didn't ask how i was or how i was feeling (i had been in pain for a few days now, with it getting worse each one that passed). i just brushed it off and went and sat in a hot bath. he came in a few minutes later and tried speaking to me. he apologized for not hearing his phone at first and i had let him know it was okay, i was just in pain. i showed him what i felt to be an oversized pimple growing on my tailbone, and asked if he would try to pop it. after him squeezing lightly a few times it only put me in more pain. i wanted him to stay with me, and continue trying to help me pop it so i could finally be rid of it and he asked if i could wait til after another match. (this had actually been going on for the past few weeks as well, where i would ask him to do something, help me with something, or even just play games with me instead, but he always just wanted to play apex with his friends and i would get upset each time. like i said, we were under the same roof but i still felt very lonely when it wasn't me he wanted to be talking to.) anyway, i got out of the bath and went and laid on the bed in a towel still in pain. i wanted him to help me feel better and pay attention to me but his game continued on. eventually he got up and we tried popping the oversized pimple again with still no luck, but more pain. he laid down with me and did some google searching, what was actually growing on my tailbone was a pilonidal cyst. at this time i got a message on my phone, i picked it up to look and he asked "who is that?" to which i responded "none of your business". it was meant to be lighthearted but i believe because of the pain i was in i answered more harshly than i meant to. he visibly got upset and said fine, and walked out the door to buy ingredients for home remedies he had found for me. he came back from the store letting me know that everything was in the bathroom for me in a way that sounded like he was still upset. i apologized for the way i sounded before he left and he told me "i just don't understand why you have to be such an asshole." the events of the day came back to me and i just wished he understood what i was going through. i didn't look at or speak to him, but instead quietly left the room and cried in another bath. i took a nap on the couch before joining back up with him in the room at 11pm, he was already sleeping. after we had that argument and he fell asleep, i picked his phone up again to see what post he was actually talking about, and if anyone had responded. reading the asshole post about me hurt me pretty badly because verbatim he did say "i don't understand how my gf can be an asshole all the time but when i say "stop being an asshole" i'm the bad guy 🙄" the posts that had hurt me the most and that had even given me physical chest pains were ones that were created 4 months ago and have since been deleted. i had come across them because one was still on his profile. it read "i can't tell if my coworker crush is flirting back with me or just being nice 😅" i know what coworker he was talking about because i also work at the same place as them. we all work at the same branch in a small community credit union. i work in the call center and they both work as tellers. he had told me when she first started that he thought she was "hot" not the polite, attractive or cute or nice that you would use to describe a coworker that isn't your girlfriend. (and especially not to your girlfriend. wtf) anyway, this prompted me to find more such posts on his account. on the main whisper profile page it'll tell you the recent activity on one of your posts, such as "someone has replied to your whisper" or "someone has hearted your whisper". i was scrolling reading the activity when i had noticed that the posts that were being replied or hearted to were no longer on his actual profile. it showed the posts on a small picture in the corner that you could hardly read if you didn't squint hard enough. i thought it simply only took to click on it to make it full screen. instead an error message had popped up and told me the content wasn't available anymore and deleted it completely. i panicked a bit but scrolled further and found exactly what i was looking for. there were 2 other posts he tried to delete about the same coworker, they read "man i'm super into one of my coworkers and i think she digs me too but we both have other people we're with" and "i'm so attracted to a girl whose initials are ms it could so easily be you. hope she sees this" and no it isn't him trying to be goofy and say that he had a crush on me. my initials are cg. at this point in reading i'm in my mom's bathroom crying my eyes out while he sleeps peacefully in the bed we share... i haven't slept a wink and have been laying on the couch in the living room all night thinking about how work will go now (they work almost daily together on the teller line while i speak to him barely at all at work as to not cause a conflict because we're actually together.) i don't know if this ms actually feels the same way or not... i don't think i'll be able to keep a clear head at all at work now knowing this...i don't know how to confront him.... should i even say anything if it was 4 months ago... tl:dr- boyfriend of 2 and a half years and i got into an argument that lead me to snooping his whisper posts. i find multiple that get my feelings hurt that also include him explicitly stating that he has a crush on a mutual coworker that he works with almost daily.	0

my mom me and my mom have a weird relationship. she's been unstable for as long as i can remember and caused me constant pain throughout my childhood. she was an alcoholic and a single mother. brought strangers into the house, experimented with drugs and left me alone to go out and party. i saw her blacked out drunk to many times to remember, even roofied, and watched her threaten to kill herself in front of me at least 5 times. but one thing i did that never makes sense to me to this day, is that i covered for her. i covered for her 24/7. i lied to people i loved so she wouldn't get in trouble and didn't cause riffs in the family. i was a people pleaser and didn't want people to be upset because of my expense. so i thought if i hurt alone and lied it would be best for everyone in this situation. and above all, i loved her. i loved her so much, even tho i hated her more than i could hate anyone. i know that makes no sense, but when she caused me pain, i hated her with my whole soul.... but at the end of the day i love her. i still wish that i would have stood up for myself and the abuse a lot sooner. it would have stopped so much faster. i am now grown and moved out and our relationship is still estranged because of what has happened, but i no longer have to live in an unstable home and it's refreshing. i feel so happy. so if you went through something similar you are not alone❤️ and you deserve better. (this is something i've been wanting to get off my chest for awhile. i know my writing isn't the best and it's a little scattered!)	0
not suicidal but empty. i wish some supportso my boyfriend and i fought yesterday and he got pissed off and called me names and after few hours he blocked me. after like 3 hours he unblocked me then today he told me to stop messaging him even tho when i was blocked i could not message him. idk what's up or if this is some sort of strategy but idk. it's true i mailed him yesterday after he blocked me just telling him blocking like that isn't funny or cool and that was all. he also sits online seemingly expected some answer. wtf is happening. also if it matters the app is what's up so he has no point to stalk me there. (some people said he might do that) . anyway he is more than boyfriend to me we got engaged i just want to tell him i love him and to forget all this shit but oh😢 *please don't tell me it will get better i deserve better i feel worse	1

recommendations for fantasy books gday guys, i'm looking for a new series to read but i'm having trouble trying out any new authors. i spent my teenage years reading david gemmel and raymond e feist and am still absolutely obsessed with them (re-reading one of their series at least once a year) but i would love to branch out and find some more similar authors. it seems any other author i try out in this genre is rather tame and i'm looking for more graphic novels that don't skip out on the gore of battle or sexual encounters. i really enjoyed brent weeks, night angel trilogy and obviously game of thrones. sorry if this has rambled on bit, i'm on night shift and my brain isn't working well 😬	0

does this seem sketchy to yall? soooo, tell me if y'all think this is super sketch, this girl, monica, started texting me a long time ago saying that nathan, who i barely met at some restaurant for a few minutes, recommended me to have me hired onto this company that she is just making or whatever. so i haven't really texted her or called her back at all much for a little bit even though she's kinda been calling me like at least once a week. so today i get a call and i decide to answer and realize it's monica and she tell me she is running a like social media advertisement company or something like that and wants me to meet her at this mcdonald's about 10 minutes away on tuesday to go over more details and stuff. so i was like, fuck it, i'm totes down, lol. so i agreed to meet her 😜 i decided to text my friends about it and they aren't too sure about it and think it could be some kind of pyramid scheme. i looked on her facebook and i see she is sorta living the high life. i still think ima go and see what she is all about. maybe bring some flower and treat it as a date, haha.	0
using shampoo as wank lube. my fuck up didn't really happen today like most stories here. it happened 1-2 years ago. **tldr** at the bottom. so i was sitting in my room, being bored af and the horny teenager i am, i decided it was a perfect time to bust out the ol' eggplant and beat it up. i went to my toilet as i usually do and discovered that i'd run out of my favorite lube, body lotion. essentially i was desperate as i really wanted to get some of that *man-milk* out of my system so i resorted to using the good old *head and shoulders™️* (h&s for short) shampoo from my shower rack and used that instead. now, what i didn't know, is that h&s forms a sort of *layer* that prevents the scalp from flaking and producing dandruff. here's where the fuck up happens. a few hours later after my shampoo wank, my penis was getting itchy so i decided to check on it. as i touched it, my fingers came into contact with a sort of smooth plastic-y layer that was *cocooning* my penis. it was like i dipped it in candlewax but it was thinner, more translucent. it was **hard** to get it off, and i mean hard. i tried to scratch it off with no positive results (thank you h&s for making it like this), i thought about using an old cutter i found but i didn't want to risk cutting my tip off so i said "*nah*" and scratched the layer some more. eventually my dick bled because of the endless scratching and i decided i had to wait this out for it to peel off by itself. nowadays i never use h&s, but if i do i always avoid any contact with my penis after having my hands in some shampoo. tldr: i was horny, used *head and shoulders*™️ as lube, ended up with penis cocooned in a shampoo layer that was hard to get off, ended up bleeding.	0

words of encouragement needed hi guys i will try and keep this short and to the point i have just found out my ex is pregnant to another guy. we have been on and off for the past 2 years but been separated properly since around october, before that we had a steady relationship for 8 years and have two children together i have not taken to the news very well and opened up a bottle of vodka after being sober for many months. i always hung on to the false hope that maybe we would get back together one day like we had always done before. obviously this is the final nail in the coffin and no chance of that now i'm not stupid and i know many people will just say move on but i have lost all confidence don't have many friends and don't really have anyone else to speak to. i'm socially awkward so meeting new people is very difficult for me i honestly feel like ending my life i can't see any hope. i have had to move back in with my parents aged 32 because i stupidly got in debt while we was together so no chance of getting my own place any time soon and now have to pay child support on top of the debt i already owe i feel so alone and any advice or if people have been in a similar situation before and got through it i would love to hear from you be nice guys i'm a man on the edge. i seen my children earlier today who are always eager to tell me all about what great times they have with their mothers new boyfriend and it hurts so much if you got to the bottom of this thank you so much for reading it's probably the most anybody has done for me in a long time so i appreciate your time ♥️	1
on taking advantage: revisit i got a hotel room for me and my best friend tonight. and thank god, because everything fell apart today. we'll likely be on the street again tomorrow, sleeping in our car. and i got rejected for the job i was hanging my hopes on, so i don't even have much to look forward to right now. the drunk we frequently stay with went on a bender and decided that although we share everything we bring into his house, although i pay for the food, and although we're not taking anything besides sleeping on the couch, we're taking advantage of him. i understand that its his home, and i respect his decision to have whomever he wants inside. but i know what taking advantage of someone looks like. fed up with his drunken, angry assault on us, my best friend texts the other guy with whom we sometimes stay. and she gets a text: "for a blow job, you can spend the night 😁😁". when she responds with a frowny face, he says she "clearly didn't see the humor" in his text. for the record, we sleep on the floor at his place, without so much as pillows and blankets. since i rejected him, he's taken to sulking and only speaking snide, snarky backhanded insults at us. i was honest with him all the way through, but now he's embarrassed because he played beyonce's "halo" to me and say he "knew" i would eventually see him that way, despite what i said to the contrary. isn't that song about an angel? he literally ignored my repeated protests. i refused to slow dance with him that night, refused to hold hands, looked openly confused and a little scared when he said he "couldn't wait for our lives together" and he "couldn't stand to sit in the same room without touching me." i would be embarrassed too - it was horribly out of line. it was terrible. he knows what our position is, and despite his frequent claims of how much he cares about us, he's getting progressively more and more aggressive, towards both of us. we can't go back - i'm afraid of what might happen when he drinks. i don't think he could overpower me, but i don't want to try it and see. i think he could overpower my best friend. the last time we were there, he put blankets over me in the morning, and the way he hovered over me was creepy as hell to wake up to. he's sending me texts about my job rejection, telling me to keep my chin up, "kid", between sending degrading, sexually explicit, pressuring texts to my best friend (also his best friend's relatively recent widow), trying to exchange sexual favors for the shelter we need. this is also the friend that promised my husband he'd look out for me if he ever went to prison. his text popped up right after one where he asked me what "we are." i've been trained not to trust my perception for years, been trained that i overreact and remember things wrong. but this is horrible. my best friend doesn't want to burn a bridge, especially when we're so down and out. but if i could, there aren't expletives strong enough to vocalize how angry i am, trapped, voiceless, again facing predator, rapist material. my husband used to use sex as a weapon against me. i don't like to be touched. certain songs send me into panic attacks. i spent all day every day and every dollar i had on him, keeping him out of withdrawals, keeping him fed, taking care of the dogs he wanted, trying to keep the house clean. he would inspect my phone every time i got home, checked my texts. he would get violently angry if i used a route he hadn't approved when running a whole day of errands for him. he pressured me into sex, but would ignore me for countless hours while i had to sit there naked, while he smoked crack and forced me to watch degrading porn. after literally two days of that, he would get angry if we couldn't repeat the porn. i just wanted it to end. i only said no a couple times and quickly learned what a bad idea that was ... and it usually happened anyways; no use in making him angry for it. and then he'd claim i never initiated, that i never touched him. but i'm rambling. what he did isn't nearly as important as why. like i told my best friend when he boyfriend left her, it's so easy when your life is crumbling and you're unhappy with yourself, when you have a supportive partner whom you happen to do drugs with, its so easy to think that a new significant other will fix things, someone completely different than the person you're with. its not your problem you're drinking and using drugs, it's the person you're using with. if you just had someone different, you could finally get sober, you could finally get your life on track. you could finally be happy. its so easy to villify that person, i told her, because the alternative is so difficult: you're unhappy because of yourself, your own failings. and what else can you change, when everything looks so horribly bleak? you can't change your job. and you sure as hell can't change yourself. i've done that research. when i met wayne, i was every kind of weak and vulnerable. he took that, became that person i thought i needed ... and destroyed everything i had left. on purpose. to make himself happy. because he could. he took advantage. god, when my best friend cried that night, her tears broke my heart, so hard, in so many different ways. when i was living with malinda, she said that a particular drug dealer was taking advantage of her addiction by making the bags so small. "one hit wonder," she'd laugh. "you take one hit, wonder where it went." but after my sources ran out and everyone was stealing from me, i went to live with him on the west side. "be careful," malinda said. "you're dealing with the devil.". i knew - i had many interactions with this man - but i was sick and stranded. what choice did i have? and at that point, how many times had i sold my soul anyways? it was never mine to begin with. i'm working on step work for my aa meetings. they want me to identify situations wherein i was powerless to my addiction. well, there's one right there. he acted like we were this great couple, pretended to leave his menagerie of other women to be with me. and in bed, he was all tender and close, which made it even harder, pretending to be in love of someone's whose temper terrified me. and immediately before and after, he was like a different person: so cold, and distant. the dichotomy and the on/off transition were so hard. and how can you even be friends with someone who you're afraid to call? i don't understand the appeal. i've been through so very much, and ptsd makes anything romantic really hard for me. but i'm not completely closed off. with enough love and help, i could really deeply care about someone. and after all this, you couldn't get someone more grateful and devoted. i know i was tricked and terrified, but no one could be as good to anyone as i was to wayne. and yet, people keep hurting me, pressuring me into mostly non-consensual sexual situations, making me fake feelings they know i don't have, looking into fake, scared smiles and pushing me even further. what's the appeal of having a crying, cowering spouse when my only offense was taking the wrong road home? or a nervous, stuttering conversation with me after you've taken two of my cars, so much of my money, my home and my body because i'm afraid to tell you about something someone else did? why would you want me to have a panic attack and consider suicide because i nicked your car's side view mirror when i told you i was too tired to drive? thank god for the kind dealer i dealt with that day, who told me that "it ain't no thing" and buffed it out with dish soap (i screamed at him, shaking: "no, no this is a thing!"). i remember being approached on high street one time when i was trying to buy weed, and giving the guy $20. he cried and told me i was his angel. but its so hard out here. i even opened my door to my husband's kid's mom, even though she had just been horrible to me, because she had nowhere to go. and i was kind to her while she was there. its what you do. she left because i walked in on her screaming violently at her son and i protected him. again, its what you do. i am nowhere near perfect; i've done things that still today just break me with guilt everyday. and i continue to make mistakes. but i can't imagine the systemic, meditated, deliberate evil behind the way some people have treated me. what goes on in their mind? i posted this all last night, but then deleted it. i don't like to seem like i'm whining - after my husband, who acted like everything i said was an inconvenience, i find myself reluctant to complain nowadays. he berated me for interrupting his football game when i had pneumonia so badly i couldn't breathe, and my fingers were blue. the hospital staff saw my oxygen saturation (76 percent) and declared it a medical emergency ... and he was upset i got admitted instead of him because he was "so much sicker.". he then left me in withdrawals every day, while he sat at home and got high. by contrast, when he was in the hospital, i never left his side, even helping him stand up and pee in the bottle they gave him. it makes me reluctant to talk to anyone - even the anonymous internet or a mental heath professional. i don't have anywhere else to go tonight, except back to the predator. my best friend doesn't want to sleep in the car, and she's not nearly as angry as i am about the whole thing ... but then again, she doesn't know the whole story. still, part of being a team is making decisions together, and i believe in this teammate loyalty shit to a fault ... especially with someone whose been as good to me as she has been. i guess we'll see how it goes. she's been living homeless a lot longer than i have, mostly on her own, and although she's a lot (a lot) tougher than i am, i trust her intuition.	0

feeling sad because "boyfriend" (m26) cheated on me. i (f23) went out with this guy on a lot of dates and i slowly started developing feelings for him. imagine my shock when i hear that he was also dating another girl at the same time even though we both agreed that we were going to be exclusive ... and the one who told me was my friend because we were all in the same friend group. i thought that we really clicked and that we could potentially have a long-term relationship. why do i always end up dating assholes 😭😭 really feeling sad today but i'll give my dog some cuddles and i'll try to forget about it. work tomorrow is going to be so hard. tl;dr feeling betrayed by someone i'm dating.	0
thoughts of suicide i've been having thoughts lately. i won't do it now cos i'm too chicken shit to do it but i am really worried i'm going down that road again. been on celexa 40mg and remeron for 3 years, i feel like it's not working too well anymore. i quit taking it for a few days just to get rid of the brain fog every once in a while, and usually it starts working again, but now i feel like it's not working as well as it used to, or i'm just more depressed? my wife is due with our first child in january, i feel soooooo guilty because i should be happy but i'm not. i always told myself if things are too bad i always had an out (suicide), but i feel like i'm stuck even more than before. nothing is working for me, and i am afraid nothing ever will. oh and also my dad has parkinson's which is hitting him hard, my mom might have bladder cancer. what's the point of living to just go out like that. fuck that, i want to go out on my own terms. told my psych i don't think meds are working, but he pretty much just ignored me. told me to take melatonin at night 😒. i've had three different psychs just in the last few months because no doctors wants to stay at the place i go to.	1
omg she said yes! she was actually the imposter the entire time 😍😍😍	0
at a loss here...suicide has almost always been in the back of my mind. it's not usually the center of my focus, but its had the spotlight for quite sometime now. i'm seventeen, and my life isn't complete shit, but i've been through my fair share of crappy situations. i was sexually assaulted by a family friend "uncle" from ages 10-12, most of it happened in front of my parents and they've only recently acknowledged that they should have done something more. my mom cried about it for a bit, but i didn't get, i guess you could call it 'closure'. her apologizing once doesn't really alleviate the pain i suffered while she knowingly allowed it. i keep thinking about why she would let it happen to me. did she not think that i was worth standing up for? i figure maybe she resents me because she sees a lot of my biological father when she looks at me. i don't want to justify her actions, but at the same time she's my mom. i have so much respect and love for her, but she's constantly invalidating me. i told her and my doctor about my anxiety and depression, but they both figured that since my younger sister's symptoms were more severe they would acknowledge her first. that was in april, and no one has said anything since. it took a lot for me to even speak up, so you can imagine how discouraged i am now. the most recent reason i started to plan out my suicide is because of a disagreement i had with my mom. as i've already alluded to, i value my mother and i have love for her. i take on a lot of responsibility for my age between being a full-time college student, caring for my sisters, and chores. my mom still persists with her recurring argument that i "don't do shit around this house." she hates when i ask my younger sisters to help with chores, and she expects me to clean up after them despite them being 16, 10, and 9. i was mad for about 2 days after her yelling at me for asking my youngest sister to pick up her things and i don't like to hold on to anger, so i went to apologize. i heard her arguing with my dad on the front porch, so i went back to my room, but they were arguing just below my window and i could hear every word. she kept going on about what a terrible person i was. she was calling me 'toxic' and 'manipulative'. saying that i was trying to turn everyone in the house against her. my dad tried to explain why he thought i was feeling misunderstood and she got pissed at him for 'taking my side'. what's stuck in my mind is her calling me a terrible person. she hasn't spoken a word to me in over a week, and i feel entirely worthless. she's just gone about her usual routine like nothing's missing from her life. at this point, she's proved that she can live without me. if she can hold the house together without my presence then what's the point in me being here? didn't mean to write this much. oh well. read it, don't read it 🤷‍♀️	1

my anxiety is only increasing, im pretty much dead on the insideas the yrs go by, my fear has grown into a huge issue. i am so scared of opinions that they drag me on a leash, dress me up, and tell me what to say. the pain honestly makes me want to throw up, but my belly is feeling perfectly fine. my mind being dragged by the 1000 pound stone called my thoughts. i can't breathe, saliva buulds up, can barely speak up. but nobody knows. having anxiety means that telling ppl will give you more anxiety. i feel i am just one more unhappy day from death. i have felt like this since 2016, and have submerged myself into the deepest, darkest place of pain. no hope, not even sucsess can take away the pain. i will wake up tomorrow, and dread the fire in my classmates eyes. to them however, im prolly a chimd minding my own business. but i am really screaming, with the only pain reliever i use to cope with my binding fear being the "it gets better" quote. which i don't believe anymore. i can't speak about it. my family may either watch me like i am a ticking time bomb or make jokes about it. my friends may not understand. they think i'm funny, but i'm rly just a walking corpse, waiting for my lungs to catch up with my heart.🖤 i honestly romanticize suicide. it takes away ppl's pain. people look down on you when they see you, but trust me, they'll love you and miss you when they are burying you. funerals are now what i want to obtain the most atm. poor family, they're religious selves think suicide equals hellfire. but i feel like i'm in hell, and one more day is a step further in the lake of fire. :(	1
am i a bad person cc? my boyfriend is back home in toronto and tonight is the second night in a row he's called me after drinking. i find myself getting super annoyed with it and getting snappy. he keeps asking the same questions over and over cause he doesn't listen. gah. someone hand me a drink.😂 plus side. i can sleep with the window wiiide open!	0
life is making useless efforts, oooops!i'm not complaining about anything but then this is all i can feel for the past few days. a lot has happened to me in the past few years and i can't put in words what all i've been through. i am even below the rock bottom and i am genuinely hurt but not complaining of anything. the only thing that i think of is, what's the worst that can happen? a person will die right? but this thought will never scare anyone who is already begging for death. then what should i care about? i've nothing to lose but i've lost everything already lol. i know nothing would ever work out for me because life isn't obliged to treat me good lol. and that's perfectly fine. but then why this endless pain and suffering? i'm numb already. the maximum that life do to me is, kill me and i already wanna die. so, isn't it a win win situation for life? i'm ready to offer life what it seeks from me. then why this constant fight between me and my fate? i'm not against what it wants of me. it wants to kill me, yes i want the same. then why this 'pushing me to the edge' thing. i'm at the edge, just kill me now. 😂 how can i make my fortune and god understand that they don't have to put any efforts anymore, i'm in for what they want. indeed, i'm in for something even extreme. ugh, wish i could pass this on god. 😂	1

tonight is the night i'm scared. i don't want to do this but my heart hurts so much, my body hurts, i'm drained physically and mentally. i have nobody, i have nothing. i do nothing to anybody and yet everyone gets angry at me and calls me names and threatens me. this world we live in is so shitty, why cant we all love one another? we all have our own issues and some of us are capable of doing more than others are. you can't get mad at me for that and its not right to take it out on me when you've had a rough day. i'm sorry i wasn't enough for anyone, i'm sorry i wasn't able to be loved, i have tried, its unfortunate that it didn't work. everyone clearly has an issue with me, so i'll help them out like i have been all my life and kill myself. problem solved. i have many people i love, but nobody loves me. i can't live life without love. i'm depressed and the only way to stop this is to kill myself. good night to everyone and i hope you all have an amazing 2019, i hope you are all happy in life and that all good comes to anybody who reads this. i hope you find your significant other, love feels amazing. i hope you all get to have children, they might be annoying but they definitely are some gems. stay safe and i love all of you ❤️	1

life is crazy isn't it? just a forewarning--i've been drinking a considerable amount of tequila and i should probably be posting over on /r/drunk but i can't resist the urge to post here🍻 whenever i drink i tend to do a lot of self-reflection (which may not be normal, but what is normal nowadays?). during these moments i just love to put on some headphones and listen to some chill electronic music (listening to freedom lives within by nora en pure for anyone who's wondering). i just want to know...does anyone else feel like they're part of a 'grand plan' or something? i'm not religious, but i swear i just get in these moments that make me feel like that i've created for something grand. maybe it's just the naiveness in me, but who knows? i could also attribute it to my self-awareness, i don't know. it just seems weird that we as a human race are just here just to exploit life's pleasures, reproduce, and die. it's like there isn't an ultimate goal other than to continue our survival...this idea just bothers me to no end...maybe i should be a pioneer for mars or something haha i welcome the thoughts of anyone else at this point🙃	0

uhh.... this is fine. (insert flaming surroundings here) my (m38) wf (f35) sister (f26) moved in with us. we've never had a chance to really get to know each other over the years until these last few months. we've had similar life experiences and relate to each other very well. i realized now that i've fallen in love with her and there's nothing i can do about it but suffer. it's awesome to feel like you're dying inside everyday. 😐 tl;dr i'm dying inside	0

had a gun to my head today, i just barely pulled it away. i've been suffering with depression for years now, mom and dad ignore it when i say i need medication or help, friend ignore it when they talk to me, girlfriends ignore it when i try to tell them how i'm feeling. it's all a big shit show as of lately tonight was the night i was finally gonna pull the trigger but i decided not to and just wait maybe a week or two see if anything goes my way for once. if it doesn't i'll surely pick it up again and follow through with my original plans. currently i have a girlfriend who i've been with for nearing 10 months, we kinda split once and she treats me good and bad and good and bad. she got raped once by the guy she almost ran off with from me but it's whatever. there's this guy named nick who she says is "just a friend" and that i "have nothing to worry about" but what she doesn't understand is that i'm so insecure from what happened with her and i before and i've been cheated on before and she just doesn't fucking get me and she lives an hour and a half away and i can't do shit about anything of this and it fucking sucks. she's the only thing that makes me happy and tonight we had a big ass fight cause i said her friend nick "had bad teeth" she flipped fucking shit cause of it and i feel like she's picking him over me earlier tonight and i just got so fed up with all of the bullshit. if any of you are wondering i'm 17 and i'm in the maryland area if anyone wants to say hi before my final goodbye 🙃	1
i really do hope i live long enough to finish the got series, with my dog and ikea blankets i cant be the only one thinking about surviving to finish their beloved favorite tv show!? -also my dad was a big got fan.he was the one to get me addicted to the show. he unfortunately passed away last year, obviously never getting to finish the series. i now make it my duty to survive until finishing this tv show and telling him all about it through prayer 🙏	0

rip lmaolike 20ish days ago i was set on killing myself. now on monday i'm going to a clinic program thing. when i went there for my intake it was nice though. it was nice seeing a bunch of other ppl who wanted to kill themselves lmao. hopefully i can make some friends..? i feel like i'll fuck it up though :( i don't think anyone can genuinely like me bc i over share so often and cant read social cues and am a social mess. i bet they'd understand but deep down think i'm a weirdo :/ anyways kinda excited. been a long time since i've looked forward to something that wasn't killing myself lol. if u got any tips lmk 👍	1
i'm done. i just can't anymore 😔i've reached my limit. i've waited so long and tried so hard to make things better, and my life is only getting more and more unbearable. my psychologist dumped me saying he can't help me. my new one saw me for over session and said she isn't qualified to deal with me. i told my ex-boyfriend that i had been harming tonight (he had always known i struggle with it) and that i am seriously considering ending my life... and he went to bed. he knows i've tried before. and succeeded, to an extent, until i was interrupted. my father, who was arrested a few weeks ago for getting violent, left a blade on my pillow. i don't even know why i'm posting. maybe someone online might at least acknowledge that i existed and that i tried so damn hard. i just can't anymore. i'm sorry.	1
eeeep i scared myself i guess this is a good thing that i scared myself this morning. i've often had suicidal thoughts in that i will get sad, think to myself "god another 45 years of this, why not get right to the end. you're going to die anyway. what difference does it make when?" but i always talk myself out of going further. until this morning. while dressing instead of putting my belt around my waist i put it around my neck just to see what it might feel like. don't worry, it scared me. as did reading about suicide by hanging with a belt. i won't go through with it. but the fact i actually put the belt around my neck to see what it felt like is troubling. i wonder if it is the beginning of my mind desensitizing myself to actually trying something some day. i'm in therapy but i'm scared to tell my therapist anything about my passing suicidal because i don't want to be committed. i have a job. i need the money. i have mortgage and cats that need me to look after them. my life would come crashing down even more than it has if i got committed. 😢	1

my best friend committed suiciude on sunday. i lost perhaps my best friend, one of the only people that actually seemed to care about me. only two days after his 18th birthday. i remember talking to him the day before it happend. he seemed happy and content with life. i can't help but blame myself for not noticing something was wrong. for not saying or acting diftently perhaps he'd still be alive. i'm in a world of emotional hurt becosuse i never had a chance to say goodbye or tell him how much i truely loved him. please to anyone contemplating suiciude reach out to someone anyone. even if you think there's no one, someone cares about you. someone loves you. the emotional pain and distress you'll put everyone through isn't worth it. i'm gonna miss you so much buddy. 💙	1

i'm dying to get something off of my chest but every time i try to it sounds so 🤮 if i had to pick only one word to describe my life so far it would be "hurrican" why? things were fine then all of a sudden it goes down hill but not just down hill, they go all over the place. up , down, down, down, up, down, up?.. then when the hurricane is finally over i'm stuck with picking up the little pieces of my life. but when you break something and put it back together it doesn't go very well, does it? especially when some parts are missing. but yeah...	0
just a quick confession that i'm definitely going to get bullied for lmao i've always thought about being in the naruto universe. i couldn't care less about the hot guys, but to think about being this bad ass chick who can destroy and save others with powers just seems so much more interesting than who i actually am. i know i'm gonna get a lot of "ur a weeb" comments, so i'm gonna just delete this real soon 😂 bonus confession: i got suspended for gay fan fiction in 8th grade even though i was forced to write it	0

i'm meeting my dad for the first time in about a decade today. last time i saw him i was pretty much a toddler, and i don't remember a single thing about him. he never tried to talk to me or invite me over during the last 9-10 years. i'm kind of scared to see him, i wonder what he'll think of me as i'll be a completely different person. of course i'm furious with him because he let money control his life (longggg story) but i'll try to avoid any conversations that will lead to arguments. wish me luck guys 😅	0
struggled with depression, anxiety since i was 6 i'm 28 now. so for 22 years i've struggled with depression and anxiety and adhd though the biggest problems are depression and anxiety. anxiety makes me afraid to leave the house most days, the only reason i go out for anything is if i'm with my husband or a neighbor or something. i also can't hold a job because anxiety kicks in and leaves me a crying hyperventilating mess in the bathroom. this feeds my depression, making me feel like a burden and wanting to die. i'm going to visit home in ny for a few weeks to help my mom while she recovers from a surgery, and when i get back i intend to go back to therapy and i'm planning to try and go back to school or perhaps try to find and keep a job, but can anyone recommend coping mechanisms until i can get in to see a therapist? my current strategy of "isolate myself and just play video games all day" is doing all of jack shit for my mental state lol appreciate any tips anyone can offer, and to those in a similar situation, i feel you, and hopefully any advice this thread gets can help you too 👍	1
thinking an aggressive flirter was interested in me happened this week. posted in another reddit but someone suggested i post my fuck up here, too: got lead on by a guy who flirted with me for four months. he did some very playful arm touching and some sexual innuendos. even sent a couple 🍆 emojis my way. i already have a man, but he's been wanting to try a threesome and this was a fantastic opportunity. well i'm thinkin', "i'm p good looking. i got this one in the bag," and i finally get the courage to initiate. i mean the guy once said, "let me be your sex toy." asked if the dude wanted to go to town on me... and he declined and told me he's not interested in me sexually. now not only am i feeling the sting of a very confusing rejection, but he served me with that sick burn on the way out. started the week off completely mortified. 🤦🏻‍♀️ they both use reddit, but i've no ego left to bruise. tl;dr: he wasn't, and i've made a fool of myself yet again.	0

i got exposed by the voice of moana i know most of u don't care but last year i was on vacation at hawaii and was staying at aulani. apparently the voice of moana, auli'i cravalho was there because there was a hawaiian language screening of the disney movie 'moana' . she was doing interviews on a 'red carpet' so i decided to record her (to post on reddit if she falls or something lmao), when she was done with the interviews she walked up to the fans. she saw my phone and asked if she can take a picture with it. me being the dumbass that i am, forgot to stop the video. so when she got my phone she noticed the recording was going and said, "ew, you have me on video?!" everyone looked at me like a creep lmao (but i still got a pic with a female 👀)	0

i just love my childhood dog. lilly has been a part of my life for 16 years. she was my families first dog and she is just about as sassy as a shih tzu can get. she has slept on my bed ever since i can remember and i am definitely her favorite. i am staying at my parents house while they are in hawaii this week taking care of the dogs. last night i had a really rough night at work. upon arriving home i started crying as i changed into my pajamas . while i was still sobbing i crawled into my childhood bed and cocooned myself in my covers. i hadn't even gotten comfy yet and lilly was snorting at the foot of my bed wanting me to pick her up and place her on my bed. as soon as i let her up she began to lick my tears away and paw at me as if to say " i know you're sad but i love you ". currently she is snuggled in right against me and i just can't help but think what a special little dog she is. i love my lilly dog 💕	0

how i got shit all over myself this morning. 🙃 oh, hi. i have a story you're gonna love. it's about how i accidentally smeared shit all over myself this morning. i woke up super early with the urgent need to poop due to eating half a pizza and half a box of oreos last night. i sit on the toilet, and on the ground i see a tiny little bug, so i squish it with a kleenex. oddly enough there is no dead bug on the ground, and no dead bug on the kleenex. whatever! i proceed to have explosive diarrhea. fast forward to wiping time. as i go to wipe my ass, mid-wipe i look down.... there is the bug on my leg it stealth climbed up me and is now running around on me in a panic. in this moment, i instantly forget i am wiping explosive munchies poops off myself, and my hands start flailing to smack the bug off of me. with dirty toilet paper in hand. and that, people of reddit, is how i ended up with shit all over myself this morning. thanks for coming to my ted talk.	0

17m from manchester uk looking for a friendship or more preferably relationship [m4f] so hey i'm jack, i'm 17 and from the uk. i'm currently a student which i guess is alright. it's pretty fun and i guess the lifestyle is very cool. i guess i'm not the most social person but yeah i like to be out doing stuff like i love going to the cinema or going to festivals or concerts or stuff. it's just so fun honestly and i just like the experience of stuff really. i really love traveling, i find it so awesome. i've been to places like dubai and new york which were honestly so awesome. like just exploring places and different cultures are so cool. my favourite food is salt and pepper chicken. i find it so so good and delicious and i think i could just eat it for days. i've not had it for a while now so yeah, sad 😢 but yeah i'm surviving and finding it alright. my biggest hobby is definitely playing the guitar. i started playing like 7-8 years ago and i just find it so fun honestly. i enjoy playing stuff on there like kasabian, oasis and franz ferdinand and it's really fun. i guess i'm looking for a good quality friendship or relationship of someone who wants to get to know me and see where we end up. i guess i want someone who i feel i want to dedicate myself to with my time and do stuff with like buy gifts for or maybe if we live close we could meet up and go out and do stuff, i'm not sure exactly what but i'm sure we'd figure. i guess more relationship wise i want someone i can look after and go out to work for and come home to. bring nice things home for you like flowers or little gifts i know you'll like and just be there for you and do stuff for you. i guess it's like the friendship one but with an additional side obviously. i've been called caring and understanding and described as husband material and i really want someone i can look after. like who i can play the guitar for or learn songs for on it or take out to restaurants and the cinema and just anything. someone who's face i can put a smile on and make laugh, who just feels completely themselves with me and i could just do everything for and make the happiest woman in the world. that's really what i want but yeah. anyway thank you for reading and i really hope we're talking soon and find out where we end up together.	0

i (f23) am so tired of living at home and dealing with my mother (f56) i graduated last spring and have since moved home and got a decently cushy job for my gap year into professional/grad school. my applications open up in june so i've been on edge since last september on studying for the relevant entrance exams and pulling my life together. getting a full time job has some what pushed back my study schedule and i find myself drowning in the work and locking myself up in my room to study. that being said, i occasionally emerge from my room to eat food and relax at the dining room table. a common "conversation" that comes up when my mother and i are home alone involve "why aren't you studying, don't you have goals?" and i answer her in apparently a very rude (🙄) way, "i'm relaxing." today was not much different but i've honestly had it and my short temperament (who did i inherit it from lol) emerged and my usual answer was followed by a "please stop asking." the argument then escalated to me being too fresh mouthed with my very asian and conservative mother on how she failed to raise me as a proper daughter (??). she then proceeds to raise a hand to slap me, to which i point out that she will, and we end up in a stare down. this is usually how this conversation goes when this topic of my future comes up, and y'all.. i'm tired. i'm not sure i can keep up this stupid facade of being a compliant daughter who bends to her parents will at all times because it's clearly getting me nowhere and nothing but frustration. i'm honestly trying my best and of course i'm studying but lately i've been going through this existential crisis on whether this healthcare career path is really worth it. having a mother who honestly provokes me under the guise of "conversation" is becoming too much and while i think running away to move in with my boyfriend and get a masters in an irrelevant program at my alma mater would be great, it's not my plan and i refuse to give up on my plan to be a dentist. i'm just not sure i can handle living at home much longer until i can submit my application and be done with this whole nonsense. i apologize for the ranty nature of this post as this literally just happened an hour ago but hearing my own mother say "i didn't raise you to speak to me this way... move out... you're really making my heart bleed..." spiel doesn't do much beyond annoy me than guilt me into giving her an apology or whatever she wants. i want to start being more independent and while i might be saying this out of spite, to not include my parents on my life any more than i need to. tldr, frustrated with living at home and naggy asian mom. how to break cycle of arguing about my career prospect/start being more independent so i can leave regardless if dental school doesn't work out for me? i'm going insane.	0

is loneliness the main reason for suicide? the vast majority of posts i see include an element of loneliness. it's 100% the root of my suicidal thoughts, i've got 0 real friends, 2 sisters and my mother. my family are amazing, my sisters always make me feel better when i'm around them, my mother doesn't know how to deal with my issues, and it makes me feel worse but i know it's not her fault. i can't do this shit for much longer i swear to god the only thing that can make this feeling go away is constant attention or death and only one of those things seems attainable. so i'm coming for reddit for attention from strangers that don't care about me and are only here because they want to make themselves feel like they've achieved something. also kinda unrelated but lsd is the only thing that makes me enjoy my own company and enjoy general life. this usually lasts a couple of weeks and i'm back to suicidal, i both don't want to abuse lsd and don't want to take it when i'm feeling suicidal. this situation is rare and most people who enjoy lsd don't want to kill themselves. i never take lsd when suicidal but that's rare, it's almost like a celebration, but at the same time it's got elements of escapism, maybe i should take up heroin cus apparently that shit takes all of life's worries away also why the fuck does everyone go to work to spend money, then work some more to spend more money, or get a better job and work harder to spend more money? it's all an endless cycle of meaningless possessions, i'm in this cycle because i've got commitments, i've got debt i've got to pay and my options are, work, prison, or death, 1 of those options seems way more peaceful that the others, can you guess which one? i've got no useful skills or talents and stuck doing something i hate for someone i hate till i'm dead 🔪🗡️💸⏳❗🚮. ☠️🔜	1

the mind and body connection is reali was suicidal because who i believed to be the love of my life and soulmate ended things with me. he knows i've been depressed and suicidal, yet he continues to ignore my calls and texts. as a result, i've been more anxious than i've ever been. i haven't been taking care of myself. i've been eating terribly, not hydrating, and barely sleeping even though i stay in bed for hours at a time. so i haven't been feeling well---headaches, nausea, stomach pain, and so on. again, he knows this. i've told him, but he's been avoiding me instead. well, today i landed up in the er. i was vomiting all day. the pain in my head and lower back became unbearable. so, i went to the er for that (not suicidal ideation) and found out i had a kidney infection. i'm in relatively good health and don't have health issues, so for me, this was the last straw. i wanted to end my life because of this person. but because the stress from him not understanding me and avoiding me has led me to become physically ill, i am done chasing after him. he is not the love of my life and he is not my soulmate. whoever that person is (if they even exist) would understand my depression, anxiety, and thoughts of suicide. he wouldn't isolate me and leave me alone, confused, and sad. so if anyone out there is feeling like they want to end their life because another person didn't "value" you, then that shouldn't be the reason. i've learned the hard way that this person isn't worth your time and energy. because there is a deep connection between the mind and the body, so any psychologically stress will lead to chronic health issues as well. he wasn't worth the stress. i'm better off alone and i'm realizing that's okay and you should too. it might take a personal experience of some sort to realize it. i prayed to god yesterday wishing i was dead and then the next day i landed up in the er. life acts in mysterious ways. you never know what your struggle or your heartache or your loss will lead to. you may find your life purpose in that way. ❤️	1

my [27m] 8 yr relationship with my gf [28f] is falling apart, and i don't know how much more i can take. throwaway for obvious reasons. buckle up because this is an absolute shit show. **tldr: gf cheated on work trip, broke up with me, decided to get back together and try being open, i acted on it, now she says she doesn't want to be open and all her initial reasons for straying/ending the relationship are invalid and that i should accept her new viewpoint. oh yea, and i think i might be gay.** first off, let me say how much i love my gf. we have been together for almost 8 years now, having met in college and with her following me across the country. we have lived together for 6 years, and i have been saving up for a ring the whole time (broke grad student here). we have many of the same interests, and share a common desire for the future, including career aspirations, kids, etc... everything was great up until recently. she traveled to one of her company's foreign offices after a friend's wedding, which i did not attend. it sounded like things were going great, until i received a flurry of texts one day while she was on a bus. she admitted that she was attracted to someone over there, and that she felt so guilty about it because it was wrong to feel that way about someone outside of the relationship. i've never seen her (through text but still) this upset before about anything, and i tried to assure her that that was totally natural, that everyone feels an attraction to others occasionally, and that what matters is respecting the other partner enough to share those feelings and respect the boundaries set up within the relationship. at this point, she mentioned that while she was at our friend's wedding, she spoke a lot with two of our friends who are in an open relationship. she said that she just doesn't believe she can sustain a long lasting, monogamous relationship (with anyone) because, for her, sex is such a huge part of life, and that it doesn't seem healthy to suppress these urges that she feels. honestly, this wasn't too much of a shock to hear. our sex life was definitely lacking, both with our busy schedules getting in the way, but, more importantly, different desires in what we wanted. she is very into various aspects of bdsm, including physical and verbal/emotional abuse, both of which i am extremely uncomfortable with. so, when she mentioned this, i said that i honestly would be ok with that, because i know there are a lot of things she wants to try that i am just uncomfortable with. and who knows, it could be fun. of course, it could end in flames, but at that point i was so confident in our commitment to each other i was willing to give it a try if this is what she needed for us to be together. i did ask, however, that she not act on anything until she returned so we could have a serious discussion. she agreed, saying and promising that absolutely nothing had happened yet, and the conversation ended. when she got back, things were pretty good for a bit. i was really trying to make an effort with sex, both in frequency and things that she wanted to try. i did have a bunch of hard limits, but they were pretty far out and allowed for a lot of exploration within the boundaries. we talked sparsely about the open status, and things seemed to be great. one day after dinner, i was talking about some bullshit and turned around to see her sitting on the couch. i knew instantly that something was up, and she laid it all on me. there was a lot, so i'll itemize for brevity: 1) while she was away, she was hooking up with this guy frequently, both before and after she talked to me. 2) they were exploring pretty intense bdsm stuff together. 3) she felt a strong emotional connection to him, having spent lots of time together sharing common interests that her and i do not share (e.g. reading for hours upon hours in a park together). 4) she resented that i am not outwardly affectionate enough, doing things like commenting on her appearance in public, or showing public displays of affection. 5) she felt that my career choice was holding her back, both with time (we have spent our 20s together) and financially (i can't afford to travel/give extravagant gifts like many of our friends). 6) she said since we started dating so young, how could i (me) be sure that she was the right person? this made her think the same, that maybe there is someone else out there who is better. the unavoidable outcome of this conversation was that the relationship was over. there was absolutely nothing i could disagree with, with many of those points being things we have touched upon in the past, and things i was extremely self conscious about. the next few days were unbelievably hazy - i felt like i was having a never ending out of body experience. i later found out that during this time, she told a bunch of our friends that we had broken up, although those words were never explicitly said between us. after some time, we wrote each other letters explaining how we feel, and decided to try and work things out. now an important detail in my letters was restating the fact that i am bisexual. i have known this my whole life, and told her a few months after we first started dating. at the time, i was still super super closeted, with her being the only person i ever said those words to. however, growing up, i was publicly outed by two different best friends to different friend groups. a few people directly confronted me about it (everyone just thought i was gay), but mostly people just made little comments here and there trying to get me to admit it. after a lot of self reflection, i've realized that this experience has caused me to hide any visible signs of affection, attraction, or general closeness with friends and family. i explained to her, for the first time, why i was so uncomfortable with different types of pda, and how even saying simple compliments would always come with the crushing feeling that people were watching me and judging me for what i was saying (e.g. oh he's just saying that to make it seem like...). i've had people say that to me on several occasions. so, after all of this, we started working on things again, and things were getting better. then she said that she needed to figure out if what she was feeling originally was just a physical, sexual attraction to another person, or if it was a genuine emotional connection. i agreed, saying that i couldn't really live with the fear that she thought there was someone else out there who would allow her to live a more fulfilling life. she then said that she had been talking to this guy ever since, and that they were planning a trip together to meet up and figure things out. this was a huge surprise, but again, i felt like i didn't have much of a choice - if she needed to figure this out, then she needed to figure it out. and when she returned, we would know if there was any future to salvage between us. i agreed, and she went to be with this guy for a week after thanksgiving. *(i think this is about the halfway point if you want to take a brief intermission)* now, at this time, i decided if she was off living her part of the open relationship, i would do the same. and, from when i read her my letter, she said she thought i should go out and experience what it was like to be with another guy. here, i had never been with a guy before, in any way, let alone another person besides my gf sexually. she was always the only one. so, i decided to act on this curiosity, and set up a meeting with another guy, all the while telling her exactly what was happening (time, place, other details, etc...) as we agreed to do when discussing our relationship status. the next day was wild. it started out with me getting my dream post-grad position, which was an absolutely unbelievable occurrence, and has since changed the entire course of my life. i remember calling her after i found out, and she was super excited, but said it was a bad time because her and that guy were checking in to their airbnb. so that was pretty deflating. then i basically said, fuck it, let me check off another major life event in the same day, and i went to meet up with this guy. we talked for a long time, and then decided to leave the bar together. i can't really express how great it was. it was...insane. it just felt so different. for the longest time, sex between my gf and i felt like such a burden, with me constantly knowing i wasn't giving her what she needed. but this time, there was no pressure, and i was just able to act. and it just... felt right. i was super lucky to have my first time be with that guy, because he was 100% understanding (he was aware of my situation) and took things slow. i'll never forget how at multiple points, he commented that i was just smiling ear to ear, completely unknown to me. the next day, my gf asked me how it went, and i told her. she was happy for me. there is a lot more to this part of the story, but this is clearly getting too long as it is. now during her current trip, she was constantly messaging me about what she and this guy were doing together. they were, again, doing a lot of bdsm stuff (he had a lot of experience, as an older guy), all of which i was made perfectly aware. things like physical abuse, degradation, so on and so on. i kind of shook it off because i wanted to be ok with everything, but it was really bad. then, on the last day, she sent me a video of them at a park together, where she said she was basically blacked out, of him and this elderly woman talking at a bar, with her saying things like "oh man what am i going to do with him, he just left me alone haha." that was kind of the last straw for me. during this time, i was also talking to some mutual friends, and starting my coming out parade. one of them happened to be bisexual, and i had a really great conversation with her. after receiving that video, gf asked me again if i was going to come out to my parents, and i just said that i would like her to talk to our mutual friend, because she would have a lot of good things to say that i think would validate many of my opinions/fears about my sexuality, rather than just constantly hearing it from me. this was not received well, with her saying things like oh, how could i not talk about these things with her, and that if i was having fears about everything, was everything i said about wanting to stay with her, about how much i loved her, was that all a lie? she called me cruel, and said she couldn't believe i was doing this to her. needless to say, i lost my shit. again, through text (because she was literally on the other side of the country fucking this other dude), i shared a massive text expressing how i felt, that her comments that i was being cruel and unfair were unbelievable myopic and, honestly, totally insane. i said that i have been trying to be cool with all of this shit that she dumped on me, and that if i really didn't care about the success of the relationship, i would have left way way earlier. this made her very upset, but she agreed not to talk about anything until she got back that night. when she got back, we decided to talk. she said that she realized she was only interested in this guy for sex, and that now that she experienced those things she wanted to try, that she didn't feel the need to be open anymore, and that she thinks she wanted to return to a normal, monogamous relationship. she also said that she realized she didn't mean everything she was saying during our first conversation (^ all the way up there ^), and that she was just trying to justify her actions. she said she realized what's really important, and that all she wants is to be with me. she said she was going to stay friends with that guy (they are coworkers), but that absolutely nothing was there. however, because things got a bit too much with the guy i had met, she demanded i delete him from my life, including phone numbers, social media, etc... (we agreed if things become more than just physical, we would do exactly this). now this is all fine and dandy, but it's what i really wanted to hear like at least a month prior. before coming to terms with my own inadequacy in the relationship, with our inherent sexual incompatibility and the need to be with other people outside of the relationship, with this crushing realization that hey, maybe i'm gay and just never allowed myself the opportunity to explore. it's like i was thrown up in the air, and now i'm just in dead space and expected to pull myself back to earth. i lived in this headspace for quite some time, both with the immediate aftermath of an acquired yeast infection due to the crazy shit they were doing, and including through the holidays, during which she spent a week with me and my family (who has no idea what is happening). all the while, i've been trying to reach out to others, including therapists, lgbt consults, and friends. however, one of my best friends with whom i would really, really like to talk is actually her immediate boss, and so i can't share any of this because i don't want to risk affecting her professional life (again, that guy she hooked up with also works within the company). i stupidly tried to bring up the conversation about being open again recently, because hey, i decided i liked the idea too. but again, was met with the same reaction - that she wasn't interested in sex outside of the relationship, and the thought of me being with someone else, guy or girl, made her physically sick. she kept saying how there are more important things than just sex, and that if i really wanted to be with her, then that should be enough. i said ok, someone needs to be the person that sets the boundaries and i will need to respect that, but it's a bit hard to believe given the entire, very well thought out and articulated reason as to why she decided to cheat on me in the first place. again, she reiterated that she was just saying bullshit back then to make things ok in her mind, and that i needed to move past her previous statements and accept what she is telling me now. so. that's where i'm at now. i'm in this incredibly fucked situation with someone who i still love just as much as i did since before this all started, but am not sure if i can cope with the idea of moving past all of those initial statements and completely reverting back to "normalcy." i'm wrestling with the concept of my own sexuality, and what that means for her (like...how could i stay in a relationship with someone if i can't give myself to them fully?!). also, that i am in this situation where i feel like i have just yielded to her desires at every step to do whatever it would take to preserve the success of the relationship, only to be stonewalled when i make requests or discuss topics that would require some compromise on her end. or am i just being selfish, pouting because she doesn't want to be open anymore and i do? yes, she was incredibly selfish at the start of all of this, but it doesn't make it ok for me to be the same. we had such a wonderful life together, and i don't want to lose what we had because of some bump in the road. she's my best friend, the love of my life, and i know if we get through this, it will only make us stronger, which is something i really, really want (she does too). but, at the same time, i'm just so tired of dealing with this shit, living in this headspace where everything is just fucked. some days are good, but many days are really bad. i'm sad all the time. i don't hate her, but i'm afraid that talking about things will make things worse, because it constantly re-opens the past and puts all of this shit back on display. i'm not even sure what the purpose of typing this all out is - we got into it a bit last night, and so this may just be therapeutic screaming into the void. i guess i'll ask an actual question. at what point in all of this shit, or with what details, do you decide what direction to take? to stay together or split because of an inability to move forward, despite wanting to stay together? any and all opinions appreciated ✌🏽	0

been suicidal for 1 month now, cant talk to anyonehardest 6-8 months in my life, been drinking seriously for 2 months now, was on 5-htp for 1 month until a 800mg overdose and i puked. nothing works out wellz everything collapses around me and no friend of mine can help me, and i dont want to put such a weight on my parents' shoulders. been thinking about death and how life would be afterwise for some time, and im losing performance at my job, gym, writing, even dating. i became completely introverted, whereas im super extroverted and i need to be around ppl to be fulfiled. i just dont want anyone around me. i texted the person who got me to this stage (amongst other things), read but no response, its like absolutely no care. i wrote an official last wish, in which i name the things relevant to name to whom id pass them. for the past few weeks i found that literally nothing brings happiness anymore, from hitting the gym, or the boxing bag, through playing video games to even jerkin it off. a salary raise didnt bring any either. nothing. i just cant. also im facing minor insomnia so sometimes i cant even fall asleep to find peace at the end of a day. with 5-htp i failed so i'll def. make sure it works next time, i just havent done it. for the survivors, why did you not end it after? i cant see any other way out... i appreciate any form of help! 😊	1
people who call themselves part of the boys most of this stuff was found on tiktok. the boys are an extremely toxic community and i don't want to be associated with them. (this does not apply to all boys) here are many reasons why: - they will be blatantly racist and homophobic and say "it's dark humor" or will call you a snowflake" - they mocked breonna taylor's death by playing "vibin in the ritz car" over a audio that was supposed to commemorate her death. many comments on the video say things like "let's ask breonna what she thinks about this🎙️⚰️ - however when people dance to a juice wrld song they get all angry because it's disrespectful despite what commented about breonna taylor - many of "the boys" have usernames like "kill.all.gays" and "gays.have.no.rights", profile pictures of pride flags crossed out and several comments saying "homophobic and proud" - they openly admit to being misogynistic and sexualize women all the time. they find videos of women showing off their fancy clothes and say "for the boys: pause here." they take pictures of girls and edit the photo just so you can see their boobs. - they act like it's such a terrible thing to support the lgbt community but think it's normal to be an incel - they make fun of women being brave enough to share their rape stories - whenever a man is accused of rape they immediately point out how it's probably false. even though the accusation is made by a girl under 18 who has no benefit of doing so, false accusations are very unlikely, and it would be better to have a potential rapist in jail than a potential liar. - when women bring up equal rights, the first they jump to is "equal rights, equal rights." like why is that the first thing you think of? i get you should be able to hit a girl back, but they just want to be treated equally and all you want to do is punch them in the face? - "i like gay people i just hate when they make it their entire personality" some people have to hide who they are for over 20 years and when they can finally be themselves they get criticized for it? how is that fair? - if there is a trans woman in the video, someone nice will comment: "she looks so pretty!" but all the replies will be the boys saying "he*" there is a new group forming of boys who disagree with most of the issues called the men. i hope many people here realize how toxic the boys have become and how they are not how they used to be. tl;dr: the boys are a toxic group. misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and transphobic actions have been witnessed many times by the boys. this does not apply to all boys.	0

weirdly attracted to a fictional character tldr: i am attracted to a fictional character a bit too much, and get a weird feeling when i see said character, and get sorta sad when she isn't real i've recently watched this show (it's an anime but i won't go into it) and i like one of the characters in it, i think it's what's called having a waifu or something, but i get butterflies in my stomach when she appears on the screen, a bit pathetic i know 😅 summing it up, it's sorta like the feeling you get when you have a crush at school, except not real, also, it isn't like this character isn't on my mind, i don't tend to think about tv shows that much outside of watching them also, to finish up, it isn't like i'm lonely or wanting a relationship, because i don't want a relationship with anyone i know etc...	0

i like this girl but she is in a long distance relationship with another dude. last time i went for a girl like this it didnt work out. i dont think its worth the time and effort kinda confused but why do girls be like this playing with your emotions? its like they know your into them and they just toy with you. so i'm going to let this one slide 😐 just wanted to share. thanks for listening	0

telling a black kid in my class he should dye his hair with kool-aid. this was back in high school but it still haunts me to this day. i was in history class and our teacher had put us into study groups of 4-5. so naturally we weren't doing much of anything. the other kids in my group (two white kids and one hispanic girl along with j, the black kid) were talking about random things and got on the subject of hair dye. one of the girls was talking about going blond and this kid said, 'man i'd like to dye my hair red but it's hard for black people to dye their natural hair.' i was really into hair dye (still am) and had recently remembered a method of hair dye where yoh could use sugar free kool-aid and cold water to somewhat dye your hair. so i told him, 'you should dye it with kool-aid.' 🙃 *i didn't know about the fucking kool-aid stereotype!* but you bet your ass everyone else at that table did. they all just sat there staring at me in mixed faces of horror and disbelief until j goes, 'daaamn sailo! ok so it's like that!' and just bust out laughing and everyone else started laughing as well. i was so damn confused. i didn't get what was so funny. and even though j laughed it off i think he was actually a little hurt because he avoided me for a bit. it wasn't until a few months later when i figured out by talking to friends what was so wrong about my statement and i wanted to die. i did apologize to j and explained that i didn't know about the stereotype. he was really cool about it and stopped avoiding me. still, goddamn. tldr: made a racist comment by not knowing about a stereotype.	0
guys, i am so happy! i've got promoted and signed a new contract and now entitle a double amount of my previous salary!! people keep telling me that i work too hard. i am that kind of employee who almost always come early (around 7am and straight ahead open my computer and work 😛) and leave the office later than most of people.. and it's often that i still continue my work at home 😬 i swear that i never had such an intention, like.. doing this only to get a promotion or higher salary. well, who doesn't want that? but actually the reason is that : i love my job and my company.. it's true!!! 🙂 i never expect that one day can change my life drastically, now i have a new position, and with new salary i can finally have more savings, some extra budget for vacations, buy new bags, shoes, omg.. this is not good.. i am so excited! and happy! and excited!! and happpyyyy!!	0
being single is fun😎 my relationship wasn't particularly awful, but other than the random panic attacks i had right after breaking up with him, i honestly feel pretty rad. like i only talk to two people now, and it's honestly great. i feel like i can focus on the aspects of my life that aren't social, you know? also this relationship lasted for over a year so changing all of my passwords do not have my ex's name in them has been a bitch😂.	0
life is a never ending shitty loopsociety is a fucking mess when i first got depressed and tried to kill myself at nine. i am now 13 and go to a therapist but it doesn't fucking help. when i finally opened up to my parents they just said it would be mean to them to kill myself. like my life is less important than their fucking happiness. i feel like there is no point to life and where i live school is fucking mandatory. all these people who barely know me thinks getting good grades is more important then my mental health and that i don't deserve to take my life or be sad because i have such a fucking good life. like that worked. i was googling least painful way to die when i stumbled across this and tbh this made me feel way better then anything else have. my biggest fear is my life going in a loop like it does right now. i am so sick of life. thanks for listening to my ted talks 🙃	1
i can't get past the fact that my life feels like it hasn't even really started i'm trans and closeted so like i can't be happy. i can't have friends because i don't want to say i'm male. i hate doing a lot of stuff. and like i'm an adult and it's crazy, i should be way more advanced and even 13 year olds these days are living their life more than me. like people say only you can change your life, but there's not a lot i can do yet 😔	0

i feel like i can really relate to u/xwearethefandomx but in the same time... hello, first of all i want to please excuse my english, i english bad and my native language is completely different. second of all i want to give you little information about me... so i'm obese, straight female, 18 y o soon propably 19, i can not consider myself as pretty but sarcastic jokes got me a few closer friends. so... i make a lot of jokes around the suicidal topic i also make some dumb puns and stuff... like i mean you can hear something like this from me: "i want to kill myself but i don't have the balls to do it" *badum tss* and last but not least thank you for taking your time to read this it really means alot to me ❤️ so now on to the other part... well take some popcorn and get ready it's gonna be a long story... it all stared when i was a 3 y o kid with quite a lot of potential but it all got burnt up by my closest... my family... i wnated to be a ballerina -well i was told one big nope "you are fat" - parents 2003-2005... i wanted to learn some type of martial art so if i get in a bad situation i could have some moves to keep myself save - well i was told noone would be interested in me plus i am heavy so no worries ... i wanted to be a cook and more specifically a confectioner - my family theory was "like i wasn't fat enough working in the kitchen will make me only worse"... well than if not the ballerina... what about any type of dancing maby belly dance? can you guess what i've been told? "aren't you ashamed of your fat body to show it?" i can't even explain how heavy was to wear those broken drams on my back... finally i got one of my dreams come true... (kinda) i started learning how to swim (at very late age) and i still can't i can... now after all of that "support" one girl between 8 and 13 how goes she feel?... depressed... anxious... and starting to have suicidal thoughts great!... i've talked with my parents about having some type of session with a psychologist and they said no why? it's expensive... at that point i started to feel lost... like i'm not a human the word become gray for me. i've been bullied in the three schools i went (this is my last year of school and i'm still being a target of bullying even for a lot younger than me...) those "gray years" were between the age of 13 and 16 and they really felt like eternity until one time i attempted suicide (it was dumb attempt and wasn't that serious)... when you read this and sum up the things... you can just blame hormones and i agree i'm still teenager and around my period my hormones go wild... well i can brag about mysef for quite some time but the title is on a bit different topic... i said that's i can relate to u/xwearethefandomx's post cause after all i'm kinda scared to kill myself because i'm one and only child. if i really do it my mom will fall apart emotionally... if i think about my friends... they probably will get well soon or may not understand... but i can't do it because of my mom... i love her and i can't do this to her... if you have read this whole thing wow! i really thank you and i would love if you share your thoughts with me and have a little conversation down in the chat thank you ❤️	1

got slapped i sent a bad joke to my friend two hours ago. he read it and didn't reply. an hour later, i woke up because there's a knock on my door and i got slapped; he stared for awhile and leave without saying anything with a serious face. i just woke up so the event sink in slowly, when i realized what happened i ran as fast as i can. when i saw him he's about to ride the bus. i walk closer to him, he gave me a questioning look, and i kissed him on the cheek. he got surprised. then i told him, "you slap like a girl, dude". he pouts and chased me as i ran laughing. we got tired and stopped running, then he give me a hug. we said goodbye to each other and he told me, " don't let this be the last goodbye, idiot." p.s. it's really funny cause he's a guy and he slapped me real hard, my left cheek really hurts until now. hahahahaha! he didn't even say sorry, that scumbag! 😂😂😂 the chat i sent him was about me saying goodbye cause i can't take it anymore, although i only said it(for now) to see what would be his reaction if i do the deed, i didn't expect him to come in my house(just to slap me lmao) because he's staying in his aunt's which is 45mins away( without traffic). we've never seen each other for a month, too so it is a real surprise. 😂 to my friend: thank you. :) one of the reason i got depressed was i lost contact to you and i can't tell anyone else of my problems. but i guess, you really just gave me a good "awakening" today, i hate you for reaching me out with a slap. 😂 i can't tell you now that i'm really depressed because i knew you'll be worried, so i only send you a message saying "i hate you. let's meet again when you're free.", to ensure you i'm still not going... when i've moved on, i'm going to let you see this, idiot.	1
launching my ~$1500 longboard into the ocean so... to start things off, this happened today. actually 30 mins ago. the day stayed out awesome. we were headed out of town, i brought my boosted board (electric longboard) with me, and we were reaching our destination via boat (3 hour ride). we arrive 3 hours later, got some food at this festival, i rode my electric longboard for 17 miles, and got back to our hotel when it was dark, around 8:40pm. my grandparents come over to our hotel and they remember they have some cookies to give us. so they tell me to come with them to grab them and bring them back. (they rented at another hotel). i brought my board with me to make it home faster, maybe about a 15-20 minute walk, but a 1-2 min ride... right when i was about to leave my brother requested that i get his toiletries off the boat because it's almost time for bed. so i said sure, (why not right?) since i'm already going to go get the cookies. i get the cookies and head to the boat i reach the dock and decide to walk to it, because i didn't want to launch my board into the water hence it's dark out and it's hard to see. i get all the way down maybe about 1/4 mile, grab the toiletries and my mom calls me to grab the bag full of food, i grab it, and that thing weighed at least 20 lbs. the walk was long on the dock and carrying a 20lb bag with a 15+ lb board was not something i wanted to do. so on my way back i decide to make it quicker by just riding my boosted board slowly (to be safe) but faster then walking speed. i get to the end of the dock and there is a gangway up to the road. i stop to get off at it since it's an incline and that's a little risky. so i go to get off my board and some how my board got launched into the ocean from what i believe was because the throttle got pushed on accident... i'm going through the 5 stages of grief currently because i'm a 17 year old who saved a lot of money to buy this board. had it for a year, and now it's gone... type f for respect ✊🏻 tldr; i went to go get cookies and toiletries from a boat, decided to ride my electric skate board to it, then my board got launched into the ocean...	0

i want to smash my car into a wall first thing in the morning.i'm tired of telling my story. it has to do with chester bennington and linkin park. i'm a young trans girl with world class musical skills who is adored by men around the world for my silly pink hair and pastel aesthetics. the music i make is beautiful, energetic, complex, emotional, and important. but nobody cared. i travelled across the country to start a band with 🌌. she abused me. she begged me to come live with her and do this band. said she'd kill herself if i left her. i told her i didn't want a relationship with anyone except those who would form this band and travel with me. she lied to me to get close to me, and has already made a plan to replace me. i never meant a thing to her, even though she said that i was the reason she realized she is transgender and all of her music was made because of that. the police come looking for me every week or so because i call the suicide lifeline every day, desperate for my story to be heard. they want me to go to a psych ward and be tortured again. i think 13 times was enough. all i wanted was to make this album and sing about the problem of suicide, and being transgender, and make the cutest, loudest progressive rock ever. but nobody cares. i did my best, and found out that i mean nothing to anyone. i am disposable at best and despised at worst. the world doesn't need me. the message is loud and clear. my life doesn't matter. tomorrow i plan on doing what almost happened tonight. i'm going to crash my car inside a tunnel driving as fast as i can. why should i give these amazing gifts to a world that has tortured, abused, abandoned, and hated me for trying to speak up about what matters to me the most? jimi hendrix, kurt cobain, janis joplin, jim morrison, and so many other rock stars died at this age - i'm 27. i didn't get to have their successes, but i understand that none of it was worth a thing to them. i get it. life has nothing of value. i have felt the drive to end my life every single day since 2010. instead of being taken with compassion, the world is reviled and disgusted at my honesty. i do not owe them my aura. when i die, i will be forgotten. nobody cares about transgender folk. we are not even second class citizens. we are subhuman. we are mistakes. abominations. mutants. thousands of men want to add me on facebook and flirt with me only because they think i'm a real girl. i'm not. i'm a tranny and a suicidal maniac. there has never been anything in this life that has given me any hope, joy, comfort, or happiness. it has been a long, cold, dry, and rough stretch of grey concrete, that my long since dead spirit has been dragged down hundreds of thousands of miles in a despair of worthless failure. i am not loved or respected by anybody. my dearest friends will turn their backs on me in an instant, all because i am nothing but pain and dread to them. my love and affection are discounted and denied, instead i am merely an expression of suffering that deserves to be erased. nobody will notice when i'm gone, except that there will be a big sigh of relief across the whole world that there is one less negative creep out there. i will be at peace, and so will everyone else. suicide is the right thing to do, i simply have no choice.	1

wife left me after i got out the suicide ward.met her on a video game when we were 15, always had feelings for her. it didn't work out when we were 17, i grew up joined the military and she came back into my life but with a boyfriend. after they broke up we fell in love all over again, so i thought. married last october and found out she cheated in 2017 when we were long distance. its beem since january and my anixety has gotten worse and worse. we kelt fighting the military sucks even worse than normal with covid, and i got busted down in rank for some bullshit. i was ready to end it and was saying goodbye to her and she asked me "what am i even gonna do if you leave me in this world alone" i went and couldn't go throguh with it. sje said she would be here for me every step of the way as i was getting admitted. i went to the ward for a week and came out to getting divorced. 😔 when i was feeling i could find some new life and move in from this stress. finally on meds and getting professional help. then she leaves me. i dont want to see the future without her. i don't want to live long enough to see how far apart we grow. i got drunk and wrote a suicide note monday in my car. the music made me cry as i got drunker. i called my sister and she called my mon to come get me, but i had already drunk texted her telling her how much i loved her, and now im blocked.	1

easy (don't really care about painless) ways to kill yourself as a teen? (alternatively: the final adventure of the world's most burnt out gifted kid)note: i'm not looking for therapy. i'm done with life once and for all. i've been hospitalized before: no effect. i'm exhausted, lonely, and tired above all else. let me explain. # part i: causes. for the first few years of my life, i was supposedly smarter than everyone else. in grade 1, i was doing high-school level math without anyone else's help (my family couldn't afford anything except for public school at the time). i got moved to a containment program for gifted®️™️ kids just like me, and i was having a blast! i learned how to code at a stupidly young age, conducted some pretty cool experiments, and did a lot of amazing stuff! unfortunately, i started developing a superiority complex. i turned from someone that loved learning because math and cs was fun to someone that loved comparing above all else; my merit came from quantification. i had to have more awards, more prestige, more medals, more ecs, more *everything* than other kids. i think that a lot of it comes from the fact that my family was never really middle-class; we've always been struggling. i've always had a mindset that i needed to prove everyone wrong. i was stuck in the gifted program until i got accepted to what i think is the only program more toxic than that: ibmyp. in middle school, i went from seeing kids that loved learning (and didn't really care about competition) to seeing kids that were the complete opposite; that's what cemented my superiority complex. we never really had friends there; middle school was only a place where we had to compete for everything. we had to get into the best high school (to get into the best university), marks (even though they didn't mean anything), and stupid extracurriculars. luckily, i made it to the top high school in the region (i would reveal its name but i'm stupidly scared that someone will find this alt and ship me off to the mental health program at our hospital again), and graduated with some pretty prestigious awards. at that point, i'd been coding for about 5 years, and i had one dream university program (really my only real dream): software engineering at the university of waterloo. it had everything that i valued: a rigorous curriculum, amazing work experience and people, and a crazy cool math department. the only issue? it's the most difficult eng program to get into in the whole frickin country. as such, i started seeing it as my only goal in life, eventually looking at admission as the only possible path to success. more importantly though, i started seeing others not as people but as numbers: the only thing i care about it how likely they are to make it into the program, and how (if) i have to beat them at anything. i've lost all sense of reality and emotion; i put on the world's greatest show for my parents (maybe i should pursue acting if this whole suicide thing doesn't work out) at home, and school isn't much better. # part ii: the now. anyways, long after i started comparing likelihoods of making it into uw, i started to shift my vision. i started seeing all the places that i was lacking (i love to build apps and cool server infra and tooling, not "trendy" stuff like machine learning and blockchain). i started seeing how much better other seemed to be; they started racking up awards and accomplishments that i thought i was supposed to get. they started getting into programs that i'd never be able to afford in a million years; and started getting into amazing positions as a result. i'm now a stagnant creature. i code, sleep, maybe study, and that's it. i've fallen into an endless cycle of anxiety and depressions, and i can't get out. see, this is usually the part when i'd ask for help or something. the problem is, i've been helped for too often. my brain's just wired wrong. every time i get lifted out of the hole, my head just starts seeing negatives again and i fall even deeper. i've tried to keep this stuff from my best friends (only one of them actually knows about this alt account, and i honestly love him so frickin much. agam, if you're reading this, i'm sorry. i really am. i know you tried to help, but i can't be helped anymore. i'm sorry.) i'm done with life. i can't go on. i don't have any real chance at getting the one dream that i've wanted since i was 11. every time i see hope, there are a million bullets put into my head from competition. i wanted to build things, but i got dragged into a lifetime of politics. don't try to help. it won't matter. i'll always be back to square one. emotions don't work on me anymore. guilt doesn't work on me anymore. i'm nothing more than a shell of a human: someone whose sole purpose is to get into uw swe. # part iii: suicide. i've tried this before, to no avail. back in my gifted days, i used to study anatomy from this one textbook (i didn't have any electronics lol) and i tried stabbing myself in the knee. that didn't do anything except break it and land me a trip into the hospital. does anyone have any methods of suicide that don't involve any invasive procedures or things like that? i'm planning on building my own exit bag or hanging but i'm not too sure. i already have my suicide notes finished (they're all really long; i guess the perfectionist in me wanted to tag along for the death ride); i just need to do the deed, i guess. thank you for your help, a very sad 15 year old.	1

have any of you ever had a pet octopus? i'm reading a book that has me curious about octopuses as pets. it's probably nothing i'd ever attempt because i have zero experience with salt water tanks, and the ones google tells me make the best pets only live for 1-2 years. i think they're too smart and i'd get too attached for it to only live a short time. but damn, i bet it's fun as hell to play with an octopus whenever you want 🐙	0
self-harm, then death. i'm tired of making mistakes in life. you know what? every mistake will either be one to three cuts on my arm, suffocate myself for a few minutes, poison myself even more, or get a hammer or wrench on the head. this will only continue to a stab in my arm, full suffocation, poison to the point of near death, or a full heavy blow to my head. it's my choice. know my fate. what do you suggest? 1) cut -> stab 2) minor suffocation -> major suffocation 3) poison -> near-death poison 4) minor hits -> heavy blows after this, i will eventually die. this is all my fault! 🔪💪😭 (-1%) life: 99%	1

tifu by participating in gym class so, today i was in gym class, and we were playing a game kind of like dodgeball, and if you get hit with the ball, you are out until the person that hit you with a ball gets hit. somebody was coming after me with a ball so i was running away. i tripped and fell, and i put my arms behind my back to catch myself, and my right arm slid out to the side and my left slid towards my legs. oof. i got up really fast, and my arm was really hurting so i kept playing for a minute or two then it was hurting even more so i asked the gym teacher to go to the nurse and she let me. so my friend walked down to the nurse and then she went back to class. so i was given ice, and it wasn't really helping. so eventually one of the nurses that was related to me called my dad because he was currently at home. he didn't answer... so we contacted my mom and she started coming from work to get me. so i got all my stuff around which took forever. after i got my stuff, my mom wasn't there yet, and so we went back to the nurses office. my mom got there a couple minutes later. so we went home and rested my arm then went to urgent care. i got an x-ray, and they couldn't tell so i would need to come back the next week. so we are still unsure about my arm but hopefully it is just is sprain, or something less then a break/chip. tl;dr i tripped onto my arm and i'm not sure if i broke it or not. i will have to go to three doctors again next week. wish me luck! 🙏	0

i don't feel real hello! i don't know if this is the right place to post this but i'm a teenager (18f) so i thought maybe it might be okay to come here.. like so many teenagers (😞), i have depression and anxiety, but there's something happening that i don't know what it is, or if it's normal.. it seems like i'm not real anymore, and nothing around me is real. it's like i'm no longer attached to myself, and the spaces around me. i think this is called dissociation, but it's been getting worse. it happens for like 90% of the day now, even when i'm out with friends or at work.. so i don't think it has anything to do with the whole lockdown. i also have been losing my memories i guess. anything i do, i immediately forget or it seems like it never happened/happened years ago. i can't remember a conversation with my mom that just happened a few minutes ago. i was talking to my best friend and in the middle of the conversation, i just got so confused and kind of paranoid i guess. it felt like i didn't know who she was, like she was just a stranger.. does anyone know if this is normal? if it isn't normal, what can i do about it? i talk to a therapist and she just suggests grounding techniques but it hasn't been working so far, so maybe there's something else i can do. i don't know. if this is normal, it doesn't feel like much of a life. i can't enjoy anything because i'm not present in the moment. maybe this is normal and i'm just dumb and think it's something else, but since i don't know i thought it might be good to see what others think. thank you to those who read this.	0
i choreographed solos for a major ballet competition a little background - i'm a dancer (currently earning my degree) and after a couple years of teaching 5-year-olds, i was offered a job teaching advanced contemporary & jazz classes to serious dancers at a ballet school. my bosses asked me after a couple months if i would be willing to choreograph 2 solos for the upcoming youth america grand prix, and of course i said yes!!! i've certainly set choreography before, but i've never had my work displayed on such a large and serious platform. furthermore, the only other choreographer setting work for this particular ballet school is a dancer named kelsi darby, who is fairly well known in the dance world (she has 16.2k instagram followers and has danced with big names like beyonce and nicki minaj). i just can't believe my name will be up there beside hers, and i can't believe how amazing my job is 😊 i'm a lucky girl	0
tough times sorry for the long explanation. i'm 20m from the uk. i have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now and i just want to see if i'm alone out there. my story starts from the age of 14, more specifically november 2012. my mum is diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer which at the time to me i wasn't worried because i didn't know what cancer was and how deadly it could be but i soon came to learn this. after battling for a month my mum suddenly died when doctors were going to tell her that morning the cancer went to her brain a small mercy maybe. but that hit hard strange thing is i don't remember the funeral or much around the time this all happened which i thought i'd remember for life. so me and my family we moved to the opposite side of the country moving back to where we was from. great everything was going amazing i succeeded at high school getting the grades i needed for college. i was even in the regional newspaper front page. so i tried out college which at first really wasn't for me, this is when the mental health issues started for me. i'm not entirely sure how this worry came about but i was scared that i was a pedophile and that i might do something terrible it plagued me every day it honestly scared the life out of me i would stay away from children, parks and even kids on tv. as well as this i wasn't enjoy my college course so i left in early 2015 and took a year off to recouperate and recover. come september 2016 i felt amazing i shook the fear of being a pedophile and was in the best shape of my life i had lost 5 stone which is around 40kg i think. i had abs and was a starter in all of my soccer teams and as every boy loves i was popular with girls. this is were things took a somewhat nose dive. i had been acccepted to another college that was close to home and i went to tryouts for there soccer team. however after 5 minutes of the game i was running and someone came in from the side to get the ball off of me. at this moment i heard an almighty pop and just felt like my leg was on fire and was hopping. i collapsed to the floor in agony thinking my leg was broke, turns out to me anyway it was much worse i had dislocated my knee cap. severe pain for a while until the ambulance crew arrived and drugged me up. after this it was relatively smooth sailing i was on crutches for a month but felt great as i had confidence in myself. my life changed forever in december 2016 i met this girl and we hit it off straight away talking all night on the phone at all times of the day. this soon blossomed into a relationship. going into the new year,2017 it was the best and one of the worst of my life. me and my partner was travelling going places together and most importantly we was completely mad for each other. this was all great until november 2017. in november 2017 my partner and some of my friends stupidly (one and only time never again)took some edible cannabis. i felt fine for an hour and then i went outside and it hit me i freaked i thought i was in a dream and i felt my body shutting down, my throat closing. it was a cold night in the uk as we have it pretty cold in the winter and it's was about -4 degrees. i freaked out and begged for an ambulance the first thing they noticed was that i was dripping in sweat which obviously isn't normal because of the weather. the second thing they noticed was my heart rate was going absolutely crazy. my partner was sick and seemed to have got it out of her system. i meanwhile was rushed into resus and seen by a group of doctors. i was still high so i don't remember that much, however i read on my discharge papers that my heart had reached 180bpm and they couldn't slow it down one bit so i had to be admitted. all i remember is waking up in a hospital bed seeing all my family. my dad said it scared him real bad as i was attached to all sorts of machines and on god knows how many drugs. after this i recovered relatively well i was still worried about my heart but i had always had health anxiety so i put it down to that. things were about to get much much worse. in december 2017 the month after, i dislocated my knee once again and needed to be hospitalised again. however this time it was worse i was sat in a room awaiting treatment on a hospital bed, and i started to get these horrific burning and stabbing chest pains my friend shouted for a doctor as i was sweating a lot once again. they took one look at my heart and rushed me in for treatment this time my heart was nearly at 200bpm and once again they couldn't slow it down i was injected with all sorts of stuff i had morphine, paracetamol on a drip and medication to control my heart which felt awful. i was having blood tests every hour and being seen by a cardiologist. i was discharged the next night. things were okay for a few months into 2018 and then i started to get intrusive thoughts about me harming people particularly my loved ones and i just couldn't take this. i thought i was a bad person and was going to end up in prison. i quickly became depressed and couldn't go outside as i was scared because every time i did i felt not attached as if i was in a dream. this took a strain on our relationship and eventually lead to the end in august 2018, she couldn't handle my worries any longer and said she had to think about herself and not me, that she didn't want to wait the 6-7 months or however longer for me to get better. so of course hurt and heartbroken this is when the suicidal thoughts kicked in for me. i felt so useless and so low like i wasn't worth anything and i started to feel dark i can't explain what i mean but i just felt dark? we had limited contact after the break up to support each other but we just kept arguing because i wasn't over her and she was over me eventually she admitted it was all my fault and to be honest i agree if i was able to manage my issues i wouldn't have lost the girl who was the love of my life. fast forwarding to october 2018 and my nan who i lived with for 5 years was taken ill in hospital and unfortunately she rapidly deteriorated and passed away at the end of october. if i'm honest this still hasn't fully set in as i just can't accept the idea she's gone. and the present day, i feel absolutely useless, a burden to everyone, i gained all my weight back that i lost so i feel ugly and lacking confidence. i just can't see anyone ever loving me again. these intrusive thoughts still plague me i can't seem to get rid of them, so out of fear i stay in my house all day and if not anything else i just watch tv i haven't been outside for a while and if i'm honest i'm barely eating as i just don't feel hungry? this is why i believe it would be easier to just end everything and not have to deal with the hurt or heartbreak any longer. i still feel so so dark and that isn't changing, my sleep is non existent i sleep at 5am maybe for 3-4 hours even if i fall asleep early i wake up and can't go back to sleep someone please help ❤️	1
saying i'm married with a child english is not my first language so sorry if i say something stupid! this didn't happen today, but i am still kind of ashamed. last summer i was working as a guide in the church. lot of tourists visits the church so i had to use english very often. i worked alone 8 hours per day in the cold church, just sitting on the stairs and playing with my phone. one of my friend, 14 years old boy, felt sorry for me so he often came to entertain me - just talking and eating chocolate. i probably should mention that i am a 23 years old married woman. so, one day i was playing piano and this friend was listening nearby. as i was playing some older couple (let's just say woman and man now on) from usa walked in the church. as soon as i noticed they were there, i went to talk with them. we talked about the church and the history of the city. my friend just sat there and was texting with someone. then this happened woman: is that your [something i couldn't here because of the acoustic] me: uhm sorry? woman: is that your [????] friend? me: sorry i didn't here woman: is that your [?????????] over there? i had no clue what she said but when she was looking towards my friend, i just assumed she was asking was he a customer or a friend of my. me: oh yeah, that's my friend! the man smiled weirdly, but we just continued our previous conversation. when they were leaving my friend was going to the toilet and walked with us. man: are you studying history or..? me: oh, i'm in the university studying (what i was studying) woman: and he is also in there? my friend: me? no, i'm in grammar school ( i think, we have a different school system in my country) man: you are how old...? my friend: i'm 14! man (looking at my ring 💍) : and you are like... twenty.. something? me: i'm actually soon 24! the couple was looking us with disgusted face and walking outside. before they closed the door, i heard they were talking to each other. woman: this country is such a weird place. you can marry someone that young?! man: and she was working in the church! what a sinner! (or something similar, disgusted and angry) in that point i realized they were asking earlier if he was my "special" friend. my friend did not hear this or understood what happened. i just guess that now there are a people who think it is okay to be married with a child in my country (spoiler alert: it is not)! it's kind of funny but i hope that i won't see them again. not a big fuck up, but i will always remember how repulsed they were tl;dr i (married 23f) said to an older couple that i was married with my friend (14m) as i was working as a guide in a church, they were not glad	0

no one cares at one point i've been depressed and people have put little to no effort to make me happy and when it doesn't work they look at me in disguise and wish i die. now thoe i recently got news that i have a heart disease that will kill me at any point if stressed enough. i've never felt so happy after hearing that. the fact that i might die, more often than others 😳 i told people about the news with the biggest smile on my face and they felt weird they said that's bad why are you happy that's horrible to hear why are you happy???????? what do they want me to be depressed???? they wanted me happy once now they want me to not be happy. hold on thoe.... i'm literally gonna die and they don't want me to be happy. that's bull. i've always had mixed feelings with death, i've always viewed death by myself the best thing on earth. so should i just achieve my one and only goal and kill myself	1
really thinking about getting started in mary kay! i'm not one to really dabble in these sort of pyramid schemes, but i've been meeting with a mary kay consultant for the past 2 saturdays and we are becoming really good friends. yay for new friends! i'm interested in the product but i'm having a hard time seeing the bigger picture. she keeps wanting me to become a consultant because my personality would be great for it. i'm all about skin care and makeup. however, i quit wearing makeup about a year ago when i stopped working and got pregnant. anyone have any success in a pyramid business? i'm not looking at this as a main source of income, merely an essentric hobby, because i'm boring and have none! 😂	0

telling a girl her flab was "more cushion for the pushin" and ruining a budding romance. long time lurker first time poster. so today (5 minutes ago) i made a mistake, first the context... two days ago i super liked a gorgeous girl whom i'd sort of know 8 years ago. yesterday she liked me back and we started talked. as one is inclined to do we quickly moved off the tinder chat as it's horrible, and onto snapchat. we were flirting well and into each other. today at work we messaged frequently catching up on life and talking. now, a quick note regarding what's about to happen. this girl is super sarcastic and funny. she was busting my chops about complaining about working out so tonight after my workout and shower i sent a somewhat sexy pic (not a nude) to her. she had a great reaction and i thought, awesome, just upped my game. here comes the fu part. she commented that she didn't have abs like mine (not that mine are amazing) and said: "so a little flab is good for you 😂 good cuz i have a little of that for sure" (cue the fu) "a little cushion for the pushin" and shit. got. real. unbeknownst to me this girl has struggled with a serious eating disorder for 10 years and went off on my ass. i apologized profusely, assured her i found her gorgeous intelligent, sexy and driven and admired all of that and as proof i super liked her originally. but alas, the damage was done. she's done with me and can't get over how i would say that to a woman. i feel awful for triggering a terrible psychological reaction but it truly was innocent as i would never intentionally say something demeaning or hurtful (especially when i was so attracted to this girl) to a woman or anyone. however...as it was happening and it became clear my fate was sealed, the only thing i could think was that i had to post it on tifu. summary: i told a gorgeous girl her "flab" was more "cushion for the pushin" and she dumped me.	0

my (f29) boyfriend (30) acts like he dosen like me. he says he loves me though. men, thoughts? tl;dr my boyfriend says he loves me so so much but doesnt treat me like he should if he really loves me i think. about us: 2008- met in high school. hooked up for 6 months before i moved to another city. 2011- slept with eachother again. summer vacation from college. 2017- february. started conversations on facebook. april 2017- slept with eachother again. but this time he had gotten himself a girlfriend (f29). he said she doesnt treat him well, and that they argue often. anyway, i was a bitch and slept with. they broke up december 2017. in 2018 we ended up like fwb. he found another girl in april i think. so he had two fwbs. i said go for it, get over your ex-girlfriend, you need this. he dumped her in june 2018. he didnt have other girls than us two and always said he wants to be poly. but from july 1018 i think we have seen eachother every day. i asked him "what happened with the poly-thing? he said he was unhappy earlier, and that now he only wants me. in september, we traveled to spain for 1 week and moved in with eachother a week later. he wanted me to meet his family. now, he says he loves me every day. and "marry me"- when he is super happy. he has introduced me to all his friends. he hugs me snd touch me. and he talks to me about our future. also: on his phone when he doesnt do the things above. always on his phone working or playing chess or chatting with his friends (from all over this kontinent" but!! why does he treat me like this: his ego. he wants to make himself happy more than he wants me to be happy. he never listen to me when i want to choose movies or tv-series. doesnt want to listen when i talk about how my day at work was because i work with so heavy and depressing stuff (refugees). if he could choose between eating risotto with sticks or fork, he would chose sticks because of the minimal effort. this is something he swears by, minimal effort, and he is "proud of it". i told him this and he knows it. and also, he has a weird humour. like, he manipulates or ignore or tease. his friends laugh when hes "funny" but i've said his humour sometimes hurt me. why does he act like this and also says he loves me so so much?! thanks ❤️	0

social justice is no justice at all, especially for "privileged" groups pz meyers and trupooka are products of the american political culture. it is a completely polarized political landscape in which you must accept almost **all** of the dogma of your political faction, lest you be labelled a heretic. i wish they could rise above the fray like integralmath, but it seems like we're going to have to deal with this partisan absolutism **every single time** we deal with liberal, american academics. the ostracism, labeling, and slandering of sam harris for his "heretical" views on the middle east are symptomatic of this. interestingly enough, sam harris exposed the bias of such "liberals" in the moral landscape. >this has more than a whiff of euphemism about it. surely we can say that a belief system known to be especially beholden to dogmatism, inflexibility, death anxiety, and a need for closure will be less principled, less warranted, and less responsive to reason and evidence than it would otherwise be. >this is not to say that liberalism isn't also occluded by certain biases. in a recent study of moral reasoning, 43 subjects were asked to judge whether it was morally correct to sacrifice the life of one person to save one hundred, while being given subtle clues as to the races of the people involved. conservatives proved less biased by race than liberals and, therefore, more even-handed. **liberals, as it turns out, were very eager to sacrifice a white person to save one hundred nonwhites, but not the other way around--all the while maintaining that considerations of race had not entered into their thinking.** the point, of course, is that science increasingly allows us to identify aspects of our minds that cause us to deviate from norms of factual and moral reasoning--norms which, when made explicit, are generally acknowledged to be valid by all parties. >there is a sense in which all cognition can be said to be motivated: one is motivated to understand the world, to be in touch with reality, to remove doubt, etc. alternately, one might say that motivation is an aspect of cognition itself.44 nevertheless, motives like wanting to find the truth, not wanting to be mistaken, etc., tend to align with epistemic goals in a way that many other commitments do not. as we have begun to see, all reasoning may be inextricable from emotion. but if a person's primary motivation in holding a belief is to hew to a positive state of mind--to mitigate feelings of anxiety, embarrassment, or guilt, for instance--this is precisely what we mean by phrases like "wishful thinking" and "self-deception." such a person will, of necessity, be less responsive to valid chains of evidence and argument that run counter to the beliefs he is seeking to maintain. to point out nonepistemic motives in another's view of the world, therefore, is always a criticism, as it serves to cast doubt upon a person's connection to the world as it is. 45 > .43. d. a. pizarro & uhlmann, 2008. > .44. kruglanski, 1999. the psychologist drew westen describes motivated reasoning as "a form of implicit affect regulation in which the brain converges on solutions that minimize negative and maximize positive affect states" (westen, blagov, harenski, kilts, & hamann, 2006). this seems apt. > .45. the fact that this principle often breaks down, spectacularly and unselfconsciously, in the domain of religion is precisely why one can reasonably question whether the world's religions are in touch with reality at all. >sam harris et al >free press >a division of simon & schuster, inc. >1230 avenue of the americas >new york, ny 10020 ><url> >copyright ©️ 2010 by sam harris here we see what social "*justice*" really is. it is the naked, bigoted bias of the past with new dogma. in their system, people have less worth because of their gender, the colour of their skin, and above all, "privilege," which is according to the pz, [shepherd of his loyal trollish flock (nsfw)]( <url>), something that you are born into that is beyond your control. privilege is their new "original sin," and in their system a man must supplicate to women for his self-worth (an innate quality that is gained from no one but oneself), preach his inferiority, his barbarism, and his guilt constantly, lest he be consumed by the demon within - his inner [patriarch](<url>).	0

how i turned my reddit addiction into something useful🦊 the internet has beaten me more often than i like to admit... yesterday, i visited unproductive sites (reddit, facebook, instagram etc) 78 times! fuck! most of those times i wasn't consciously visiting those sites. it just happened.. that's why i made a useful chrome extension for myself that redirects me from distracting websites to useful and interesting websites! no more reddit for me, but more indiehackers! no more instagram, but [trends.co](<url>). no more youtube, but more producthunt. you get the picture 📷 if that sounds something you want to try, you can add it to your chrome browser for free. any suggestion would be more than welcome!

i [20m] got high for the first time in a while and got in the wrong car when ordering an uber. i gave him my address, too. i got out without being kidnapped and walked to the train instead. then, i called 911 because i thought i was being followed. for some reason, i got a refund for the base fare of $8. now, i'm on my way home on the train. phew 😅 i'm still high. p.s. marijuana is not a suitable drug for everyone. i only support marijuana use for medical purposes. goodnight! (i know i sound stupid, this is what weed has the ability to do to a person. i certainly think we need to do more researching before jumping to conclusions & legalizing it. let's focus our attention on psilocybin instead.) oooooooooooooooopooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo tl;dr	0

i feel like i'm going to have a mental breakdowni've been casually suicidal (like... i wouldn't care if i got hit by a car, wouldn't move out of the way if one was speeding toward me) for most of my life, beginning at age 5 or 6. i turn 20 in two weeks, for reference on how long it's been. i used to pray back in elementary school that i would die in my sleep, and i've never reached a point where i actively wanted to be alive. recently, i've felt so fucking awful and i've wanted to die so badly it's insane. my mother treats me like shit because i'm not a trump supporter. i hate my job. i'm not good at anything, i lack a lot of basic skills due to my years spent crippled by mental illness, and i objectively offer no worth to anything in the world. talking to therapists doesn't work because i don't trust them not to judge me and no medication works. recently i had a big confrontation with my parents because they were talking shit about me with my little sister when they thought i was out of the house. i wasn't, and i let them know i heard everything. of course, then they were like "omg you're just so negative! it's hard to spend time with you because you make everything so glum!" and i finally snapped and was like "im severely depressed and haven't been happy since like 2007 what do you want me to do"... so they pretended to care about me for a couple hours, which was nice. immediately afterward tho they continued to treat me like pond scum. so like i said, it's always just been casual and not anything concrete, but for the first time in my life, i'm genuinely considering ending my life. i just don't know how or which method is most precise while also keeping the pain to a minimum. my biggest concern would be who would walk in and find my body? that'd be scarring for whoever it is, regardless of how tenuous my relationships with my immediate family are. i imagine i'd place increasingly blatant notes throughout the house like "there's something upstairs!.... please prepare yourself before going into emma's room!..... call an ambulance first maybe!.... there might be a dead body in there don't freak out it's fine" lmfao 💀 anyway. hopefully i can muster up the courage to do it very soon. not sure if i should wait until before or after my birthday tho it might be cool to be 20 for a little bit	1

lying to my parents and to the police this event happened several years ago, so not today, however when i found this page i felt forced to share (sorry for being so long, tried to make it as short as possible). i live in switzerland but am from middle-eastern decent. when i was 14 my best friend nick and i started hanging out with an older crowd (16/17 years). these guys were already going out to the biggest club in geneva. (need to be 18 in ch) and kept inviting us to go with them, saying they could get us in through the back door of the club. eventually we agreed to go with them. the plan was that we both tell our parents that we're sleeping at each others place, and stay up till 10 am and go home after (we could never tell our parents we're going clubbing at the age of 14 + are parents know each other but don't regularly speak.) clubs close 5:30/6:00 so we figured we could just hang around until 10 and then simply take the bus home. here's when the fu started. we went to the club as planned and had the best night of our lives. but when we were on the 8 am bus back to our homes (couldn't handle staying up any longer), i realized that i had lost my brand new iphone that my parents got me 2 days before, somewhere in the club. i didn't know what to do cuz i knew my parents would never believe that i lost my phone at my friends house, it's almost impossible. so i had to come up with another lie. i arrived home at 8:30, after a 10 minute walk from the bus station, changed in the garden (i was so nervous they'find out that i even left a bag in the garden with spare cloths), and rang the door bell. as soon as my mom opened i busted into tears saying that i got mugged by a group of 6 people at the bus stop and that they took my phone (great acting skills btw). (i also told her my friend had a private tutoring so needed to leave his place early in the morning). i immediately went up to my room to sleep for a bit. at 11, my mom woke me up and told me she called the police and explained to them everything, and that we had to go see them asap. at this point i was tripping hardcore, but tbh i preferred lying to the police than telling my parents the truth. so i invented a huge story to the police to explain to them what happened, precisely describing the faces of each person, what they said, where and how it happened, etc. even though i was completely shitting my pants, everything seemed to be going well, the police (and my mom) was buying my story. they then asked me which bus i took so they could check the recording of the bus and see if the "muggers" were on same one. i told them the e bus from town. my mom then said "doesn't he live further from town than us"? at this point i needed to lie even more, so i told him nick's parents recently got separated and that his dad is staying at a place close to town". it was a close call, but in the end everyone believed me and the police ended up refunding me the entire price of the iphone (only in switzerland i know 😂). (and i was very proud of my bullshitting skills). but 10 days later i all went to shit when my mom was on the phone with nick's mom and started saying something along the lines of "i'm so sorry to hear that you and your husband are having troubles". when my mom asked me why i lied about this, i told her that they really are and that she probably didn't want to say it. but this already put some doubt in my mom's head. later on that day, the final blow was dealt. my mom found the spare cloths bag (which i had forgotten about) in the garden, and put the pieces together. she figured everything out, told nick's parents and we both got screwed big time. tl:dr tifu by going clubbing at 14 without telling my parents. ended up loosing my new phone so told them i got mugged, only to find myself lying up lying to the police as well. in the end i got caught because i lied about my best friends parents and forgot a spare "clubbing"cloths bag in the garden.	0

my dad really knows how to ruin everyone's day 😎 i woke up this morning, i was shirtless because i was on my way to the garage to cut my hair (i have a buzz cut so i cut it myself, it's getting a lil longer than i'd like). so i walk over to the garage from my room, greet them and as im going in the garage he goes "put on a shirt, it's cold out there". i just said "it's ok i'm just cutting my hair" (who tf wears a shirt when they're cutting their own hair it gets all itchy). to him, me just saying that was a "disrespectful rebuttal". as i walk away to go get a shirt him and my step mom are arguing over it and the morning is ruined because they're all pissed off at each other, and i'm just confused.	0

i'm placing my whole life on one decision and i don't know how to not.⚠️trigger warning⚠️ stop reading of talk of suicidal ideation and stuff triggers you. sorry - i've been in an abusive household my whole life. i've tried to od three times but i only count the one time that i took 38 pills. i'm with social care and on monday they are going to decide whether or not i'll get placed into care or get taken back home. i'm staying with my aunt currently but i cannot live with her full time. no one in my family can have me full time. i'm 16 and it's the biggest decision that will affect my life. on monday the panel will decide whether or not i'm going to be in care. i'm scared and anxious about the results. i know that if i get rejected from care, i will end up attempting again. i'm so scared because i can't live with my father anymore. he hits me, screams at me. last week on monday (i was still at home) he shoved me over my beside table- causing loads of bruises- and then hit me with a piece of wood. he tells me to kill myself constantly and i'm scared. honestly, i would rather be dead, in hospital, or in prison than going back. school is the only thing i have in my life but it's half term at the moment. i don't know how to stop thinking like this. i don't want to die. i just do want to go home and if i get rejected then suicide seems like the only option. please help.	1
voting will not help you. i am a us american; one who is sick of my country's lies. although i can no longer vote, i can type. so hear ye this! your votes are not going to help you! the foxes are in control of the hen house! their tactic is to throw you occasional bones to make it seem like your will is recognized, but truly the only food they hand out are are lies containing little real meat. they throw you these little bones to keep you appeased; promises of more sustenance to come... but it never actually arrives, does it?. small concessions always. but the important things, such as pulling out of the middle east? not selling weapons to blatant terrorists? not polluting the planet? good luck! the warmongers will continue to poison the world and wage war unnoticed within your own minds. you are to be kept busy with your personal problems while thieves steal all the goods. school, work, relationships, promises of eventual retirement... these are all carefully engineered to keep you oppressed. and oppressed you are. do you ever feel like there is something terribly wrong with the world? there most certainly is, but it's not what the controllers tell you it is; it's much, much worse. it's not the terrorists they claim exist who are your worst enemies; no, it is the accusers themselves. *they* are the ones truly terrorizing the planet. and it is not human overpopulation we need to be concerned about: it is the over-consumption and the utter waste of a system that can't possibly continue! both parties may not be the same, but they *do* grow from the same body. how can you not see it? just take a few moments away from the manufactured chaos you are subjected to, and perhaps you will see what i see. or not. the programming runs deep. go ahead and vote! try your hardest to effect "change" by playing under their rules. it won't help at all! meanwhile your tax dollars are being used to commit murder! don't you know that you are analog computers, but that you are also much, much more than that? program yourselves or be programmed by others! <# <3 ♥️	0

subway employee starts recording me / taking pictures of me... hey all, hope you're all having a great friday. i don't really care about this type of shit since we're all being monitored basically 24.7... just curious as to why the fuck a subway employee would record me while ringing me up lol. i walk into subway, "how are you sir, good evening." dude asks how i'm doing back, makes my sub, no problem. as he's cutting my sandwich in half i notice a chick behind him w her phone covering her eyes and i look directly at her like "?????" i took a step towards the register and the phone literally follows me to where i moved.. at this point i'm like "?????" again lol. she proceeds to lock her phone and just rings me up as if nothing happened.. should i be concerned about this? i could only think of 4 possible reasons of her recording me.. 1. she likes me and wants to show her friends? why??? i never even visit this subway often enough.. 2. she thought i was someone who robbed the store.. again i don't go there often (wouldn't steal either) 3. she was trolling.. 4. she could possibly use my picture/video to do me harm in some how.. (this is probably exaggerating lol) what would you guys do in this situation? i was thinking of going back, ordering a subway and when she is ringing me up / making my sandwich i just take out my phone and start recording her as well just to see her reaction 🤣🤣🤣 interested to see responses as to why this subway employee would record me... thanks for reading.	0
your boy took an l today today, i had a math zoom lecture at my college and a fine ass lady shows up in the sidebar. naturally, i pin her video and decide what i should do next. after contemplating for a while, i private message her asking for a snap and she gives me the snap. that's a win for your boy, right? wrong. i snap her asking how was the recitation and she said she couldn't pay attention because she was laughing the whole time. you see, during the zoom meeting, my roommates were all standing within the view of my camera and doing crazy shit because i lost a bet. i saw that she was laughing so that's when i asked for the snap. anyways, i respond back to her saying that i couldn't focus either with some 😏😏😏 emojis implying that i was distracted by her looks. she then says "lol nice".... ok fine shes playing hard to get maybe. so i then ask her for her number. two things could happen when i asked her: she says yes which means she's interested or she says no because she isn't interested. i figured that since she was willing to give me the snap, i was in. boy was i wrong. she responded back saying that she could give me her number but she wanted to let me know she has a boyfriend.... then she follows it up by saying that we can still play 8 ball. smh. i was led on this whole time only to be kicked in the balls. alexa play all girls are the same by juice wrld thanks for reading	0

how do i decide my major/career path without wasting a huge scholarship? (17f) i'm really anxious about it. i am graduating from high school next week just to get going college. i got a full ride because i work my ass off at school, and am planning to double major in graphic design and marketing. as i get closer to college i can't help but feeling that this career field won't feel fulfilling to me. ultimately i would like to found my own nonprofit benefiting human trafficking and using marketing strategies to wait raise awareness for the issue. this is all great and all and human trafficking is what i'm really passionate about, however i feel like i won't get to make the impact i want by just doing advertising. i am pretty charismatic and love to speak publicly. i am a huge people person, am very bubbly and love listening to others. i also love standing up for others and pushing others to do what is right. if i wasn't so scared of law school i would definitely become a prosecutor because i am so passionate about putting traffickers to justice. i hate government related things and the judicial system bores me, so law is a lost cause for me. i love true crime and have considered criminal justice / forensic science, but i just don't know. i feel like i'm not inclined to that kind study because i'm not gears towards that...i'm definitely more artistic and the creative type, not as much an analytical type. so i'm kind of at a loss. i've considered social work but i don't even know if that's what i'm looking for. please help me navigate this time in my life. any careers that you think i'd fall well into? any broad majors? i really don't want to waste this amazing full ride opportunity. tl;dr need help navigating my interests and passions. would love someone wiser and older to help me ❤️	0
celebrating my birthday by myself no, this isn't a sad post. just wanted to share how i'm doing. i'm preparing for a moot court competition, and training just finished. we started before midnight and ended at 2 am, so i started my birthday training. hahaha. i just got home, and i'm popping open a beer, at my dorm's balcony. it's serene and quiet. likewise, my facebook barely has any greetings (just how i like it) because (1) i hide my birthday on facebook, and (2) i kindly requested my irl friends not to make a public greeting for me. thankfully, they've been compliant. cheers, reddit! to depressing downs of life that lead to harsh lessons, and hopefully to a better version of ourselves! 🥂	0
not muting my phone and thus reddit kept my wife awake i posted a video before going to sleep and didn't think about it getting that much attention (actually got on the front-page 🥺) i didn't mute my phone for the night (i do 24/7 support so it's always on but only rings for clients that are elegible for 24/7 support). my phone allegedly pinged all night long (my notification sound is the sound star trek tng uses when a something unlocks) i'm a heavy sleeper and take meds for the night and only my ringtone gets me awake. so i posted it nothing much happened,a few upvotes but nothing that would be registered as a notification, went to sleep (with my phone under my pillow) and when i was fast asleep the post was marching towards front-page. i didn't get any of that but my wife was awake for hours because my phone didn't stop playing the unlock sound, and she couldn't wake me up (go some scratch marks on my arms now 😅) so i just woke up and got the worst telling off (she is meeting friends today and is pretty much destroyed, not enough sleep, bad sleep, headaches..) and i'm looking forward to sleeping on the couch the next night... tl;dr didn't mute my phone, post went to front-page and my wife couldn't sleep because of the notifications while i slept through any attempt to wake me.	0
standing up my crush so this story actually takes place between yesterday and today. so for a bit of back story, i play on a beach volleyball team with my crush and 2 other people. last night i proposed the idea that we go practice since our season is about to start and madelyn (that's what we'll call my crush) was totally down even though she had plans already the next day (which is today). madelyn told me that she would just move her plans earlier to make time to go practise and wanted to practise at 9:30 am. so with that, we inform the other 2 people on our team about the practice and everyone says that they're able to practice. an hour or two after everyone said that they would be able to make it, one of the partners changes their mind and says that they actually can't make it. so we all jokingly express the inconvenience and i assumed that we would call off the practice since we were out one team member so i left it at that. next day rolls around and i sleep into 11:30ish. i have a text and snapchat that were sent at 9:40 of madelyn asking if i'm still coming. i obviously missed it and to add insult to injury, i have all the equipment and it turns out the other partner ended up making it to practice. i feel like a dumbass 🙃 tl:dr: i made plans with crush who is on volleyball team, everyone said they could make it, one person changes their mind, i assume practise is canceled and stand them up.	0

my heart feels broken every second of my waking life. 💔😞 i can't go on.hey so i'm just typing all this on my phone in bed. so i'm a junior (male) in college and basically, a few years ago it's really specific but i was watching the show the good place in an ap class in high school (i think it was after an ap test or something and we were just having a chill day) and i forget what episode it was, one of the earlier ones, but there's suddenly a sound clip that plays in the show of "the bad place" of people screaming and yelling and i never watched more of the show but i suppose that was something like hell? long story short i grew up christian (lutheran) in a great family with no relationship issues in my immediate family, i'm 20 now and my life growing up had nothing to complain about, i did well i'ma school and am and a great college now going for a major in film. i mentioned the good place because that's where i really began to have issues. literally when that sound clip played i had never in my life and never have since then just been frozen like i was. i just started sweating and i think i went to the bathroom, i didn't visibility panic or anything but i have never been that suddenly and mindlessly panicked. basically, that's where i began to have issues with hell. like, how can such a place exist, basically. how can there be a place where people are put to suffer for all eternity. a few more key memories: -freshman year of high school my sister-in-law (who was then my brother's fiancee) told me she didn't believe in hell (making me anxious about people even in my family maybe going to hell) -one day when i was home from college i was talking with my dad (we don't have issues but we never really have serious conversations) about hell and he tried to comfort me by saying it's probably not real (again making me anxious) it's not just hell but also romantic relationships. i never have been in one but have had many occasions where i thought girls were interested in me (even one asking me to dinner) but either they weren't and had a boyfriend, or weren't christian. thinking about girls has been a major plague on my daily thoughts, i've ever asked three out and all no, i know that's not a reason to stop but with that and my faith issues and my self-harming and depression, i just don't know anymore. so regarding self-harm and depression, the reasons for it long story short are mainly for these reasons. also, one of the reasons is my major: being a junior in the film program having had no internships and not even knowing if i'll like any job even though i went into film and not engineering or something because i really enjoy it and am simply quite good at editing and making videos on my own when i do summon the will to make anything (very infrequent). so for self-harm and depression, i first sniffed rubbing alcohol in freshman year of college then before i could stop myself i started to drink it, i stopped myself quickly but i had to retch a bit. i dabbled in pretending to kill myself with a knife by making the motions without actually cutting since then, a few times i went in the bathroom and tried to cut myself but couldn't. i tend to go to sleep with a knife under my pillow or near me, sometimes going to sleep holding it for comfort or something, as if hopefully i'll cut myself when asleep or something. i'm in a christian org on campus but have not been going to anything this school year, it feels like i just want to avoid it. i am in an apartment though with three other christian guys also in the org, i'm friends with them but not nearly as much as the girlfriend of one of them and another girl who lives nearby who lives near us. the second girl i had asked out in feb of 2020, the girlfriend i was going to ask out and nearly did during the summer, but i didn't and a few days later i found out she had been dating the future apartment-mate for a few months, i didn't know. basically it turned out that we kinda all became a friend group (me, my apartment-mates, my one apartment-mate's girlfriend, and the other girl who i had asked out who is best friends with the girlfriend) and me and the girl i had asked out are friends now but i still can't hang out with her without having some kind of romantic and relationship and sexual desire, and also the apartment-mate's girlfriend i'm very attracted to her and she hangs out for at least a few hours at least every other day at our apartment, it's so hard to exist with them in the living room though because whenever she's here they're pretty much always physically close (they literally lay with each other for a few hours at least every other day on our couch) and i'm very attracted to her also and nearly always have sexual desire thoughts toward her. but basically it turned out that it was these two girls i told about my issues with hell and wanting a girlfriend (not about being attracted to the girlfriend though) because they're christian and very nice, and they were the first people i told my issues to. but it's so hard because they hang out here every day and they know i have severe depression so i can't avoid them or they'll think somethings wrong, if i stay in my room when they're at our apartment they think i'm hiding which i kinda am but i don't know. a few months ago i started to self-harm by warming up kitchen knives on the stove and pressing them against my forearms. i've had a few cycles i don't know why i do it whether it's punishment or attention or idk. but i only a few days ago was the first time i actually cut myself, it wasn't barely any blood just a little on the upper side of my arms, i wear long sleeves now but both of the girls who are my friends know about this. right now as i type it's been a few days but i still have very noticeable burn and cut marks on both my arms, enough to sting the first 24 hours or so and now more like a constant itch that hurts and feels weird if i touch it. i dunno, both of the girls said they were seriously considering putting me in some place for a few days like a treatment center hospital or something? with covid online classes i've barely been able to do school at all, i skipped all this past week like i can do that i be ok but still i'm really behind and it gives me stress but my classes aren't too hard at all and i can still do quite well, as and bs. also, i have been going to a therapist for 5 or 6 weeks but cancelled my last appointment and feel like i don't have plans to make another unless someone pressures me to. i told him everything i said here besides the actual cutting and blood which only just happened in the few days. i've been on sertraline 50 mg since mid-july, doesn't feel like it helped much and told my doctor this, but he just doubled the dose to 100 mg which i've been doing for 4-5 weeks now, doesn't feel like it's made any difference. but then again i don't really exercise like at all so i mean, pills ain't no wonder drug or anything. i dunno. i feel like i'm using hell as an excuse to feel bad but it's causing me such terror and pain and anxiety right now, thinking about all those people who might be going to suffer for all eternity, it just sounds fucking stupid and impossible for god to allow the more i think about it. and the apartment-mate's girlfriend, a jealousy for their relationship and physical closeness is making my depression so much worse. i dunno. even music has begun to be bland the past few days, and it's hard to eat more than the minimum each day. i dunno. i just don't want to live but i don't want to die. i think i'm going to heaven but i don't know. and even if i do, all those people in hell... like what the fuck. 💔😞	1

giving the uber driver directions note: english is not my 1st language. i'd like to start this off by saying today is my 16th birthday. i was going home so i got uber. i told him the address and told him to follow my directions then follow the gps (so that the gps takes the route i want) 1 minute in, i told him to make a turn boom a car scratched the trunk 15 mins later we got lost so i gave him another directions through a really narrow street. guess what, it went ok . we are back on the main street but we need to make a u-turn boom a car fucks the front as we make the turn (shape of "t" . we are the vertical line while the other car was the horizontal line ) the scratch was big this time and the driver is really upset. i feel sorry for him 😓. tldr : today is my birthday so the uber driver got into two car accidents .	0

another tiring hour (this is sort of a diary and i am not sure if this will be removed. if it will be, this is already backed up. if not, i'd be glad to hear what you think about it and how you are in times like this) i am writing this down today as i know you'll understand how the dark times work and i like to start documenting this for some reason too. depression fucks you up in a speed even you can't keep up. i call it the dark times. it's like a black hole that sucks everything good in you: your confidence, motivation, excitement, goals.. there are days where you just feel "damn! im awesome!" dark times come and that's when you feel like shit. that every detail in you, every cell, feature is just shit. nonsense. wasted energy. during dark times my brain just works like the tokyo pedxing people. everyone going different ways all at the same time. just different thoughts buzzing any moment. random stuff, mostly physically and mentally harmful stuff. someone from the hospital calls it 'the voices' i don't think they're voices because it's just me speaking mentally to myself. thoughts like this can happen in just a span of 5 minutes then i distract myself. here's one today: ▪️i dont trust the medication. any kind. ▪️someone said the meds only pulls the motivation lower so i dont kill myself. apparently it demotivates me in all ways too. ▪️i don't feel any motivation to do anything at all. ▪️i want to feel love but i know i'll be terrible at it. like always. ▪️a few people motivates me. in fact, one. ▪️i dont want to go to work tonight but what am i going to eat ▪️holy fuck.. bills ▪️i want to be something but can't it happen the easy way? ▪️i want to quit my job but what am i going to eat ▪️im going to kill that crazy ass kissing bitch ▪️i both want to live for the good things in life and i also want to die now. ▪️why do i have to think about them!? ▪️i hate that i am now stamped (diagnosed). ▪️can i just sleep and not wake up anymore ▪️why am i writing this down? maybe i am just seeking attention. maybe they're right. ▪️ this cigarette hurts my throat but mooore ▪️no i dont want to smoke ▪️how does it feel to be at the hospital after self harm, eugh the attention ▪️let me fuck a lot, ill call ___ ▪️no i cant i dont want to its too much effort ▪️dad can i just go ▪️fuck this and it goes on.. the fact that i am just lying in bed not doing anything, not moving at all while thinking of all this tires me mentally. it fucking drains me. i didnt even move at all!! why am i so tired im just in bed! i am so mad! stop! *sigh* stop.. *turns phone off, sleeps right away* i am lightyears away from self harm as i have couple more reasons not to. i think of it and i want to but i just cant. this is not an ask-of-help or support. i just want to know your thoughts about this or your similar experiences. its wrong to think about this but sometimes its good to find someone who has the same stuff going on. it relieves a part of me to know i am not crazy or delusional. idk..	1
i felt like a new woman for a split second. married two years. my son (8) was playing with our dog this morning before school. he had his shoes on. his shoes made a squeaky noise (you know that noise they make in a gym). my husband told him not to make that noise again as it will scratch the floor (??). son said okay. son played with dog more and accidentally made the noise again. he gives husband 😬 face. husband, under his breath, says "jesus f-ing christ." i said "what did you say?" he said "that kid doesn't listen." right in front of my son. so i took the kids to school. husband texted me that he's "incredibly annoyed" with the kids because they don't listen. he said that i need to defend him and take his side, no matter what. that when my son made the noise again, i should have bitched my son out (yes, his words). he said that because he is the husband, i must take his side and it doesn't matter if i have any idea what he's talking about or what it is that my child supposedly did. so, i said no. i said that just because he's the man does not mean he has ultimate power. i told him that i will not stand on his side when he treats a child like a thing. i told him that i can make my own decision on whether or not my kids did something on accident. i feel like i just won a battle or something. sad, i know. but i'm usually too scared to put him in his place. he's now ignoring my texts. i don't know what to do anymore. they are not his kids. we have done marriage counseling. yes, his "man power" attitude is a common occurrence edit: to clarify, i did not stand up to my husband in front of the kids. nothing happened in front of them besides my husband's fit. i'm not happy i "won." i'm happy that i was able to articulate my thoughts well enough for him to (i think) understand.	0

head games... so, basically me and my fiance broke up in october, because i was hiding something that i should of told her, so when the time came, i had to tell her, and well, she didn't take it good, she ended with me.. i moved out pretty quickly without telling her, she was on tinder within a couple of days, i was staying in my friends sofa, drinking etc, a week or so later, i found out she slept with a guy in our house, and i basically got my own back and slept with 3 people in a week, which isn't like me may i add... however, i wasn't honest, hidden it from her, she told me she didn't want me back, but then i hit the wall, realised what i was doing wrong, we decided to take it slow, but everything i done within the month of us parting was coming out, my friends stabbed me in the back, we no longer speak.. begging of december we slept together for the first time, and she cried, said it shouldn't of happened, been on a date, and lied to me, even though she hates me lying. on boxing day i met up with my last ex to get closure and to hear her say sorry for how she treated me, i was going to tell my ex when she got back from her holiday, but a friend went behind my back and told her! great friends i have. new year eve my recent ex spent the night with my so called friends, and we argued the whole night, as she was listening to the rubbish they was telling her, even when i was being honest, she didn't believe me, so i blocked her. new year's day i woke up to a message of '😭' saying she was sorry etc, so i gave in, we spoke deeply, agreed one last chance for me to prove her wrong, felt kinda good, then the next day, she said she changed her mind, that she needs space to think, however, yes i was dishonest and hurt her a lot, but she hurt me a lot too, mentally and physically. she doesn't want to loose me completely, but not talk for a month, but i'm willing to give my all for her, as when we was together, it was so healthy and happy. so i got the courage to say i can't wait and watch or hear about her doing's whilst getting space. what do i do! i've had a few relationships, but this one was different, i wanted to marry this girl, as much as i don't believe in it. do i just focus on myself, but a part of me hoping, or completely let go? because my gut is saying she will realise, and come back.	0

going to the shooting range tomorrow ye. people on this site pushed me over the edge. have already been feeling extra crappy for the last week or so. yesterday i just started to feel like hey maybe i do deserve help. ... was actually supposed to see my doctor today for an appointment and referral to a psychiatrist but apparently because all my wounds are self inflicted i am not entitled to the same level of care as other people and "don't have a life threatening illness" so the tiniest glimmer of hope i had is gone. yeah good one 👍🏼 cya later world t minus 24 hours	1

i don't know if it's depression, but it's hurting. firstly i'd like to say, i just stumbled into here by a complete accident but... around this time, i feel like... it was a good moment to. secondly, the title. i... really don't know. and thirdly, i don't really... know where to put my words, what subreddit, what place to look what place ... to do anything. i've been a long-time lurker, and just... sort of finally tried to step a bit further in. if that makes sense, anyways. i'll start moving this along, sorry about that. in truth, i don't know what i'm going through. but i do know that i'm... hurting. it's not a physical pain, but it does hurt my heart. i don't mean to sound dramatic but it's that kind of emotion and sort of mental connection with things that i always seem to get and i can feel it straining, bleeding. as it were. sorry, i'm just... sort of.. writing as things come. i've been having a few rough days as of late and sorta just.. keeps piling up. i'm sorry. i'll get to the gist of it, stop rambling. sorry -- as i said, i in truth don't know what's going on with me. as of late, things have been, at least to me, difficult. a lot of the people i've spoken to, that i consider my friends have all been having me feel... unimportant. ignored. i guess. a lot of the things i'll say will go unnoticed or just not responded to, but someone else could say the same thing and get a conversation out of it. people always want to do things when it doesn't include me, or just, i'm just.. plainly.. never included into anything. no one really wants me to join. for a month or two now, i've been trying to get into the swing of my new job. it's a pretty okay foot-in-the-door kind of gig, a nice... breath of life into me considering i needed it to start finally paying off my student loans. only drawback was, it's a 10 hour overnight shift. so i've been trying to really get into the swing of that, to really... figure how things work and at the same time, try and cast my attention to this group of friends but... it seems that i've... been benched, or just.. sidelined as a person to them. i write, for a roleplay character. i would like to think she's a likable kind of lot i've set up. people say they like her, they try to interact with her, and things and maybe for a few single instances, things happen, but then... they're overtaken by someone else's "new thing!™️ " and whatever i've had is... just gone. like the thing didn't even matter to them in the slightest. that whole joke 'meme' of "friendship over with x, new best friend is y" kind of deal... just another instance of like, from view the connection i've had with people completely just... tossed. whether it be, writing characters for roleplay or even just simple conversation. i'm not really... "connected". no one really talks to me. and it was something i put away for a bit because my friend, or rather, the closest to me now tried to disprove that, and for a little bit i believed them. i really did. but then it came back. came back by the meaning of just... i stopped believing it. i kept feeling like i was ignored again and again and it just sort of... kept breaking me. i don't know, is that something to understand? guess another bit of insight, i'm... a 'leader' in a community, leader in quotations. i'm an admin, and just... i try to be as approachable as they come, friendly, active, cheerful, but just... i'm very much forgotten in things. at least, that's what it seems to me. enough to the point where i sometimes feel like i'm always on the back foot, brushed aside to be dealt with later, no one wants to try and... simply just... hang out. and while... one could say, there's people trying to talk to me, there are, but, they... don't give me room for much... if... anything. one-liner conversations, rhetorics masked as threads... that sort of thing. everyone, to me, seem like they've put some distance between them and me, and... i don't know why. i've never figured, and... to be truthful, it's the most hurt i've ever felt. hell, even my own... so.. is distant to me as of late, we're an ldr so there's a joke to be had. cruel... i- ... there's nothing i can do about it. they've stated that, as a fact. sorry about the words. i help lead a loving community that's been full of smiles, laughs and have truly been supportive to others. but even as that exists... so close and yet... so far. i've never felt so alone. anyway, sorry about that. i didn't really mean to be dramatic in any of this... at all.	0

not cleaning the sink then texting my boss at a late time this fuck up happened earlier today. (on mobile so sorry in advance) my boss, let's call him sam, is not loved within our work place. he loves to micromanage and do everything his way, even if this way is wrong or not efficient. sam is the owner of the business witch is a dairy/coffee shop/take away shop. we are fairly isolated from town but it's in a largeish community so good business. anyway, earlier tonight we were packing up and i was washing the dishes. i've been working here for a while so i definitely know how to wash dishes. i had to wash out the container that we use to batter things in. this container has lots of batter caked onto the sides and top of it, so it's a bit of a chore to wash. when i was done i forgot to clean the sink out so there were bits of wet batter lumps on the bottom of the sink. my ride was here so i had to leave. this was my first fuck up. i get a text from sam about the sink, he basically says that you need to not do that and the others had to redo the dishes. now the sink may had been dirty but my dishes were certainly clean so i send a reply saying sorry, but it could be read in a wrong tone. after that i'm in a bad mood and snap at my family a bit. anyway cut to half an hour ago (12.30ish) i'm laying in bed being mad at myself and sam when i remember to ask for a day off. i asked him in person but he told me yes, and to text him. so i did, at 12.30 in the morning. like the dumbass i am. he hasn't replied but i expect he probably will be a bit grumpy at me tomorrow morning. i don't think he'll do anything drastic but you can never tell with sam. he's about to loose a lot of staff as we go back to school in feb so i don't hink he'll was to purposely get rid of anyone tl;dr: i didn't clean the sink properly at work then sent a text to my angry boss at 12.30 in the morning asking for a day off. basically i hate myself🙃	0

for those who you who are loosing a while ago, i was on this community searching for triggering content. i was taken to the hospital, and when i got through hours and hours of waiting, i was told i wasn't sick enough to be admitted. i wasn't. i've never attempted suicide. i think i was in love with suicide but i'd like to think we've broken up now. and i think the reason i am leaving suicide is because i like people a lot more. i love the way we think, i love our little idiosyncrasies, our messed up emotions and the way we all can think the same thing is right or wrong. i want to see us thrive and fail and fall and sing and crash and loose and find. i want to see it all. for those of you who are loosing, really loosing. you could be loosing because a family member died, or because you have shitty brain chemistry or because you're favourite number two pencil broke. but for those of you who are loosing, it's okay. it really is okay to loose somedays, to fall in love with suicide (or anything the public would consider to be 'bad'). it's okay to decide you need some space, or go on a break . those days that tend to turn the noise up and the common sense down (and vice versa) are okay. one of the reasons i love us fellow human beings is because we all have different stories. and that same characteristic is making this really hard to write. i used to wish i could take everyone's pain and fold it into myself. but i don't want to do that, because your darkness your pain your suffering your loosing is apart of you. so as much as i want to say something that helps every one of your stories, i can't tell you how to deal, or how to make it go away or how to ease it. but i can tell you genuinely that i love the way you think, i love your little idiosyncrasies, your messed up emotions and the way you and me can think the same thing is right or wrong. i want to see you thrive and fail and fall and sing and crash and loose and find. i want to see it all. please let me see it all ❤️	1

asking my ex to hook up so a couple days ago my ex followed me on instagram after a year of no contact and asks me to catch up, well while texting her she tells me that she broke up with her boyfriend and is taking some time to heal up; i without thinking about it sent her a semi naked picture telling her: "well let me know if you wanna hook up then? 🤷🏻‍♂️" to what she replies: "i see you haven't get laid in a long time ... don't be so horny, i know your better than this" after that i just liked the dms and didn't reply anything because i don't think i could come up with something good, plus i was kind of ashamed for it, like who the fucks reply with a semi naked picture 😂; pretty sure there won't be a catch up lol. some background here, we are over with each other and honestly just appreciate each other and our past relationship; i did wanted to have that catch up but fucked that up tl;dr. ex tells me she broke up with her boyfriend, and i sent her a semi naked picture asking to hook up	0

everyone should be bisexual everybody should be bisexual/pansexual/whatever else. hear me out, relationships shouldn't be about sex or anything they should be about weather you like the person or not judging by their personality. and if you don't want to have sex that's fine. heck, you can even still have kids cause if adoption. so basically what i'm saying it don't give urself a sexuality just date whoever u want. the only problem i see with this is some people still might want to have sex but not with their partner so they might cheat but other than that idk what else. plez let me know ur thoughts 👇	0

how seriously should i (21f) take my boyfriend's (25m) smoking habit? he (25) started smoking as a teen. stopped for a few years and recently picked it back up (january). the reason he did is he started doing his hobby again where he has to preform and it stresses him out so he smokes when he's stressed. he's generally a very controlled, well rounded person. as hypocritical as it may be, he takes his sugar intake very very seriously and is overall a healthy guy. it obviously eats at my (21f) soul but i mostly kept a "you're an adult, you know it's bad for you. do what you want." attitude. i obviously try to stop him when he wants to smoke or buy a new pack, but i mostly am quiet and i back off. what's making me post this is because he reassured me he has, maximum, a pack a week. i overheard him talking to his friends saying he usually has 12 ish cigs on a day. 1) that is more believable to me 2) i am worried he's lying to me about it. he tells me everything and i never shame him for anything. i'm his friend, and when he needs me to, i offer him advice. even when i don't want him to buy a new pack, i'm gentle about it. it's never: "😡!!! u buyed one last week!!!!" i never knew anyone who smoked. i hear it's bad but i also grew up hearing sex is bad. so is smoking that bad? he says he's gonna quit soon. is that something everyone says? i'm already worried. should i be more worried? should i take it more seriously? side note: i grew up battling childhood obesity. today, i have 50 more pounds to lose. i lost 70. i met him when i lost fifty, fell off the wagon, and then lost 20 more. working on my last 50. my sugar intake is way too much. he is deathly afraid of diabetes and will whine and get so so worried when i have candy. i almost never buy candy in front of him. we both have our demons but...i don't know. i'm hoping to lose weight and exercise every day to encourage him to be healthier with his body too. maybe go get blood tests together or something, encourage each other. start running together? i don't know. please help. tl;dr my boyfriend started smoking, reassured me he'd quit soon. i found out he smokes more than he lets on. how seriously do i take it to try to stop him?	0

approaching a huge life change as an ambivert trying to spread emotionalism [m21] 🖐️ so i've been mulling all this over for a while and doing a lot of emotional processing and would love some perspective, or even just a pair of ears if you've got a sec. thanks in advance! i am one week away from starting my dream career in a well known travelling performance group. i didn't go to college and honestly thought something like this was going to take way longer to attain; i was mentally prepared to work my shitty survival jobs as a struggling artist for another couple years at least. i am hurtling toward my wildest dreams and couldn't be more excited. but, somehow in the face of this immense success, i have found myself feeling more socially inept, more isolated and more introspective than ever before. i normally pride myself on social pragmatism and emotional transparency with pretty much everyone in my life, but for some reason those qualities have felt increasingly dogmatic and egotistical lately. is this me holding myself back because i'm intimidated by my own success? do i not feel worthy of accomplishment because i am also extremely priveledged? am i subconsciously distancing myself from my current friends so i'll feel less guilty when i leave? to process and rationalize all this i usually end up going out and socializing as much as humanly possible, which is a major double-edged sword. as the great john mulaney once said, "do my friends hate me or do i just need to go to sleep?" the current answer is probably the latter, and since i'm starting to ramble i'll leave with these questions. in your opinion; what is the role of the ego in practicing self care? how do you encourage those around you to wholeheartedly pursue their goals without sounding preachy? where is the line between humility and self-sabotage? sorry for getting weird and philosophical but i just had to get some words down, thanks for reading!	0

people who've dated or are married to people with different ethnicities/taste than yourself, what do you guys cook/eat? i enjoy food lol, too much. i'm willing to eat anything edible and i don't mind stinky stuff since i grew up eating that way (ie fish sauce; curry etc). i've dated people who eat the same way i do - stinky, spicy food so it was easy didn't think much... but now a guy i'm seeing has expressed he only eats plain chicken or anything not flavourful at all... like for real... he orders chicken burger with no mayo and no other fancy condiments... chicken strips, no-spicy chicken bites lolol. and to me it's just bizarre 😱 he did mention he's not picky but from what he eats i beg to differ... when we eat out i'm ok cause i can order whatever i want, but now i'm thinking if i wanna share food (ie: make it at home) from my background that it's super flavourful he won't be able to eat it... and it will take away the fun for me lolol so people with different ethnicities/taste, how do you guys share the eating experience together?	0

i think i'm obsessed with body fat ***helpppp 😭*** ok so a short while ago i started weightlifting and before then i was a runner etc. when i was younger i was considered obese and i have no idea why but i am so obsessed with not going back there. no one ever judged me or acted badly towards me when i was obese but for some reason i'm like traumatized and i've been doing anything and anything to avoid going back there and it's like unhealthy because ughhhh. i just work my ass off and it's like i get so anxious when i weigh myself. and i know i'm not getting fat but that number keeps climbing up. just weighed myself and i'm at 168? i think? and i was at 164 before and before that 159 and i fucking know it's muscle but still. it just haunts me 😭	0

(skip to end if you want to hear idea) a bit of a rant about karma and my idea for fixing it to me upvotes are relatively meaningless, this isn't even my main account but i mostly lurk on my main account or look at memes. on this account i just follow subs like r/teenagers, r/crushes, r/socialskills, stuff of that sort, and i try to both give and receive advice. it's for me trying to be wholesome and helpful, and to try to improve myself at the same time. most of my comments are either trying to help people get out of tough situations or encouraging them to go try something they're thinking about doing; in short, i'm using my experience to help others (and also using this to ask for advice sometimes). however as you can imagine, most posts that blow up in this sub are memes, so this is one of the few subs that i generally sort by new on, in order to find posts where i can be helpful. that results in me not really getting much karma from most of my posts or comments, which i'm fine with--my goal is to help people, not to become an internet sensation or something. so you may ask how exactly i ended up with over 13,000 karma then, and the truth is that it's from the occasional random post or stupid comment that somehow blows up. around 8-9k of my karma is from a comment on an askreddit thread, talking about the situation on our very own r/teenagers where a kid faked cancer and got all sorts of awards including almost 100 platinums. it was the day after that had happened, so it was somewhat of a hot topic, and that's how the comment ended up with over 30,000 upvotes. i got around 1,000 karma from my post talking about my confession to my crush, which i'm totally fine with--most of the posts/comments on my account are related to social/crush stuff and at the time i was so excited i just posted about it, all freaked out and everything, and it actually became popular (and got gold somehow). yesterday, on "that one story" on r/tifu (i'm not saying what post because it's kinda disturbing but you can figure it out) i commented linking a sub known for housing the most odd and repulsive posts and stories on reddit (once again, will not link due to lots of disturbing content but you can figure it out), and i got close to 1,000 karma from that as well. i guess my other 2-3k is just assorted from my other posts and comments, but this goes to show that the posts/comments that matter are not always the ones that become popular. obviously, everyone has a different definition of "what matters," but i personally think that most of my work on this account is good and it helps a lot of people, despite the lack of upvotes. this is why i propose that we isolate the memes from more serious content. obviously, we have post flairs and whatnot here on r/teenagers, but i still think it could be worthwhile to create a sub named something such as r/teenagerssocial, r/teenagersadvice, or something of that sort, in which we can move towards a better community of helping each other. not that this isn't a good sub, but i feel like a more specialized and less broad subreddit could make it possible for more people to get the advice, encouragement, or reassurement they need. thanks for coming to my ted talk😎	0

i [19f] can't fully trust my so [22m] after drawing another girl and sending it to her. can i trust him again? backstory: my boyfriend \[22m\] and i \[19f\] have been together for about eight months now and it's ldr. everything has been great, and we try our best to visit each other when we can. long story short, one of his hobbies is drawing and he's actually pretty good at drawing people specifically. we have a lot of mutual friends through greek life and it's how we met too. there was an incident that happened a couple months ago where he saw a girl's selfie on instagram and was "inspired" to draw her. but the thing is, he drew it in the type of way that made her look more flattering? (or at least this was his perception of her? kinda like that anime-ish style) and i found out because she put it on her insta story tagging him. saying "oh my gosh, thanks for making my day @him <3". he's only ever met her once at a party we went to together, and i personally see her often when i go out. of course, when i saw her story i got really jealous and furious. like the idea of him sitting around for awhile drawing this girl into detail that he thought was really good looking and then proceeding to send it to her made me really upset. and i confronted him saying i didn't care about him drawing, but the fact that he sent it to her made me extremely uncomfortable and what he did could be seen as something else. heck if some guy drew a cute picture of myself that i met once at a party i'd be either creeped out or flattered depending. but she clearly was happy from his gesture. he responds by saying that i'm overreacting, that he made her day, that in no way that it's cheating, accusing me of being controlling by not letting him draw girls (which i didn't even say at all) and that he didn't even know that she was going to post it on her story. even then i'm still just so upset at the fact that he sent it to her. like look, i wouldn't have cared if they were close buddies, but dude you only met her once. he even went as far as using pornstars' as an argument on how they separate work from their love lives; okay buddy your drawing is just a hobby like did you really have to pull that out. in conclusion, the fight was bad, but we eventually talked it out and he said he misunderstood me and won't ever do that again. the fight took a toll on me and made me question my trust for him a little, considering he was arguing how happy he made the other girl and that i was overreacting to begin with when he should've just understood how uncomfortable it made me. my insecurities and fears got the better of me and one weekend when he came to visit, i went through his phone while he was sleeping. and lo and behold, i found out he lied to me about not knowing she was going to post it because she explicitly asked for a better pic for her to post it, which he happily sent. and the conversation went like this: him: hey! i saw your pic on insta and wanted to draw you 😊<3 her: oh my gosh!! this looks better than me, thanks so much!! can i have a better pic to post on insta? him: sure! and don't say that, it's you so of course you look good :) her: (heart emojis) thanks so much you made my day!! <3 i was pretty guilty snoopy and finding out he lied messed me up on top of my fear becoming true that she was going to be so sweet on him for the gesture. i told him what i did and what i found out. and ever since then the trust in our relationship took a blow and sometimes i catch myself wondering what else he's hid from me. with how the fight went down, and me resorting to what i did, i wonder if the trust can ever go back to the way it was. even though he forgives me for going through his phone and understanding why i did. he's aware of how much damage was done and tries to prove to me that he won't ever hide things me again and wants to regain my trust. things have been going fine ever since, but what happened still eats at me now. what should i do and can the trust ever go back to the way it once was? tldr: bf draws a girl's selfie on instagram and dm's it to her. i saw it on her story and confronted him, this lead to a full blown fight that left some damage. i went through his phone and found out he lied to me about her posting it and saw how sweet they were with each other in the messages exchanged. we're trying to rebuild the trust, but is there already too much damage?	0
i need help ⚠️important things to note before reading: i'm currently 15, i have adhd, i am an introvert and i have been seeing a therapist.⚠️ my life, honestly, feels like a living hell. personality: tries to always stay positive, caring, tries to be helpful, kind, etc. school: i have had 0 true best friendships that have lasted more than a year. i have been bullied in school since the second grade (its gotten better but it still happens a lot). 2nd grade-now: everyone thought i was poisonous and if i touched them, they would die. because of this, my 2nd grade classmates created "the chris touch" (like cheese touch/cooties). no one ever invited me to parties, birthday parties, sleepovers (infact, i've only been to one sleepover at someone else's house in my entire life), etc. no one would be my partner for school project, no one wanted me on their team for sports, no one would let me play games with them, no one would want to sit at lunch with me (sometimes if i got up from where i was, people would move it on the floor, but maiy to a different table). i was alone. in 10th grade (right now) whenever i try to help someone, i would always get yelled at by the person i'm trying to help with "i don't need yo help boi!". i basically hate people so much. home: (note: my parents aren't mentioned as a problem because they aren't one) my brother is the fucking baine of my existence; he has verbally abused me, critized everything i do (right or wrong), physically abused me. he has almost killed before (he didn't intentionally try to kill me), he once pushed me and my head almost fell on a power saw. he is the main reason i go to a therapist, 2nd reason being school. what keeps me from suicide: video games is honestly what helps me keep from suicide because i actually makes me happy and i'm easily able to talk and make friends with people online than real-life. yet people online still make fun of me saying things like, "having more online friends than real life is sad". another reason being it would devastate my parents and i don't want that at all. i just don't know what to do with my life, and i don't want it to be suicide to be an option. i've tried everything to help me and nothing works for me. please just someone help me.	1
i have no idea what's going on but i want it to end. after my relationship ended a few weeks ago, i have plunged into the strangest and deepest of miseries. every *single* day i am constantly breaking down so hard that i completely soak my face in tears and end up vomiting, i cannot remember the last time i genuinely laughed at something, i am always harboring extreme self-loathing thoughts, i wake up wanting to kill myself and i go to sleep wanting to kill myself. i used to absolutely love my subject (mathematics) and now i have to force myself to even read a single page from a book, as i have no motivation to want to do anything. every moment feels like pure emotional suffering. i am always on the verge of tears, i am always begging for death. the funny thing is, i have no real reason for any of this. i don't even really think about my ex that much; the relationship was only 6-months long anyways and largely based on mutual lust. i think i'm just starved for physical affection, and that physical affection in the past has staved off my depression to manageable levels. perhaps, maybe my random plunge from manageable depressiveness into *severe* misery is merely coincidentally lined up with my relationship ending. i don't care. all i know is, i'm just a college student and i have not undergone any traumatic incidents since my abusive childhood. i have no real reason to complain; i mean, jesus, the other people on this board have had to go through divorces or dead relatives to get to where they were emotionally, and they're *still* stronger than i am. and yet, i feel like i'm trudging through the worst feelings i've ever had in my life. what the fuck is going on with me? i'll try to make the "right life decisions" (i already get good grades and have a decently sized social circle and have been attending therapy, but i'll also try to sleep at a reasonable hour, eat 3 meals a day, go to the gym, and drink a lot of water, all of which i haven't been doing as consistently). if that doesn't stop the breaking down and the sheer emotional pain soon, i am ending it. even though i would feel severe guilt over those my death would deeply hurt, this is just no way to live a life. i am non-functional. worse than just not being happy, i am constantly feeling as if i was just told my mother and brothers have died in a horrific car crash and, also, my wife of 10 years has been cheating on me with my best friend. and nothing of the sort has happened. i am objectively one of the luckiest people in the history of humanity. i am in a position where i can easily do the right thing (go to classes, do my homework, study for tests, eat my meals, exercise, and sleep before midnight), and that is all that is asked of me. i have no bills to pay and no mouths to feed. and yet, i am still completely and utterly *uselessly* miserable, and at such a young, fruitful age as well. how will i feel when i actually face hardship? i don't want to continue if i have no real reason to believe that i will feel better soon, or that this random sheer pain won't come up again later in my adult life at a completely random time. if always doing the right thing™️ does not change how insanely broken my brain chemistry is, then i am effectively like an incurable cancer patient and should reserve the right for euthanasia. in any case, i wrote this to vent, and to ask if there are other people that feel the same amount of sheer, sheer pain over fucking -nothing-. thank you for reading.	1
i got the job! i work in a miserable corporate desk job at a fortune 500 company, i've been grinding here to save up, support myself and pay off student loans. it's late afternoon on a friday before a long weekend and all of the higher ups are long gone while i'm here working. i just got a call from an agency i've been dreaming of working at for years now. after going through a very long and intense interview process, i got the job! now i just have to finish out the day and pretend nothings up since my manager bailed for the day already and i can't give my two weeks. i am about to make it rain champagne 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾 happy friday:))	0

i lost my entire list of art ideas i had a list of art ideas on my phone, which i thought was being backed up, and i lost it all due to a phone malfunction. i didn't think i could be so upset by this. but, regardless, i remembered some of the ideas and i can always make a new list. i just have to double check that it's backed up. it's weird but i really just needed to say this to *somebody* who could understand the plight of an artist in this situation. 🤷	0

[meta] lets talk formatting and the such i am wondering what is the most appealing way to format my posts for others to read. if you take a gander of my posts here they are usually a pot of questions more than they are a story with follow up questions about it. so i have taken to posting more in a list form thinking it would be easier to pick what you want. what do you think? have any ideas? also what kind of posts do you look for when you check into r/cc? do you want to find someone with a commonalty you can talk about? maybe learn something new? just trying to sharpen your conversational skills? or are you just bored af? ohh, also i think this would be a good time to shout out others in this community for what they provide. i would like to see what you like and why you like it. and i am sure the person's day will be made to hear you like their stuff enough to say something. \_\_\_\_\_ thanks for reading 🐻	0

how am i supposed to do this? 🤦‍♀️i am just sick of fighting with myself and people to delay the inevitable and now i wanna accept things as they are. but then again i start seeking hope in people or things that everything would be fine one day. how can i just get this thought out of mind and accept that i will always be as miserable as i'm now? ps- i have tried taking sleeping pills to numb my mind but even that doesn't seem to work. so, pills are a no for me. no sympathetic or motivating comments please. just need to know how do i accept my fate. thanks	1

the art of not giving a shit😎😎😎 yeah,so i' ve seen a lot of people act insecure throughout their teens and mid-twenties...the simple but noble art of not giving a shit starts now----1️⃣. don't overthink- let's be honest most guys and girls overthink about what to wear or not,just.... don't... wear anything and everything you like. 2️⃣. don't fear about public opinion- if you are in public (away from anyone who knows you), most of us try to downplay our behaviour and try to fit in.....do what you want to do but keep in mind this simple line" they don't know me,i don't know them,the probability of meeting these guys again is next to zero,so i'll do whatever the hell i want to do",this simple line changed my behaviour from public awkwardness to public indifference and i count that as an improvement. 3️⃣. try not to fit in with the ordinary- there are a lot of people who do crazy things just to stand out, there's no need to do something drastic, try to stand out by being better than your peers,be it in academics or sports....and try to think what is different about me,then act on the points about yourself that you think are different from the others. 4️⃣. consider yourself superior- this is an unpopular opinion but hear me out ,you should have a few points about you that are unusual or different than the norm,be proud of them...you may appear as slightly arrogant but,treat everyone with kindness(no joke or cheesy line intended) help everyone you know in small or big ways, it's all up to you. 🔷🔹🔹note:,:small_blue_diamond:🔹🔷 this was my opinion on being confident, it's a different journey for everyone but be strong and try to be proud of yourself, i appeared a little arrogant to my teachers,but 15 days later my classmates and teachers began to think of it as a part of my charm,so i guess.........it worked .....do keep in mind that these tips are not for online sites, everything is different there and if you "dare" appear arrogant ,well you're satan's spawn.....	0

my personal opinion about our privacy a quick disclaimer over here: some people have amazing parents who they can reason and talk with, i'm writing this for commonly known actions where our voice and thoughts are not being taken into consideration, "normal" actions that come from imprudence and invasive natures so the last few days i've been wondering why is so usual for some of you guys that your parents check your phone without your permission. me myself have never had this problem, my parents trusted me and reasoned with me the when they gave me my phone/tablet/computer. now, i made a question on reddit and i got a few disappointing responses ( <url> ) one of the reasons they said was that because they love us: love, its pretty wonderful isn't it? if i remember correctly, love needs 2 people, love needs consent, love needs trust, if my parents really loved me, they would ask me, they would ask for a conversation, love is not equals concern. get that. because you have to be grateful and because everything you have is because of them: it's pretty rough to hear this, but some parents need to know that we never had any other choice, we are grateful, and (at least i) we try to demonstrate our gratitude the best way possible everyday, but some parents expect something else back, and is power over us, somehow, in the stage where you start to grow as a person, in the stage where you can reason with yourself, in the stage when you can finally say no to the world... they fear us. they fear what they don't know, and guess what, they have to deal with that! like it or not. i have problematic parents, and as i grew older i realized how wrong my parents were in certain topics that concerned me and only me. they had to stop fixing my problems because theirs were even more fucked and i've had a lot of talks about this with them about this. we are not in some sort of 18 years free trial with a huge debt waiting for us to pay, because a freaking 1 year old baby is not going to get a job, they were not capable, we were not capable, we are now capable to reason, and they don't like that. some parents know that at our age what we need is space, and thankfully, i talked my way there. because they own us: this is the one that i hate the most. we are not owned by anyone or anything, we are not objects, we are people. it's horrible to be told that our values, voices and opinions are invalid because...? you own me? get out of here. but right they like to put things very gently with sparkles and everything: "i'm your mom 😥" "i try to protect you 😭" "you're too young to understand 😔" so...? that's it? look, most adults try to cut you off with the fact that "we do not understand", even though we do. we need to fight for ourselves and i say this from personal experience, my dad once punched me in the face because i didn't want to talk with him, so he made me talk. i had this conversation with him where he practically had to apologize for this. at that point, i felt like a fucking dog being abused by its owner, yeah, i said the word, owner, in how many cases are parents manipulating emotionally, conceptually, and physically their teens with unjustified and normalized punishment? because they love us? honestly, fuck off. to protect us: awww :3 this one sounds so cute! /s do they know what they are protecting us from? have they asked us if we are aware of that? if the answer is yes for both questions, that means they don't trust you. example: there are many dangers in this world, serial killers, thieves, pedophiles, people who enjoy a meme but dont upvote, you name it! that's why we have police officers, right? ok, now, they don't know who's a potential danger to society, are they pointing guns at everybody? are they getting into people's homes to check who's a serial killer? no. they can't. now imagine this concept in a smaller scale, where our parents are "protecting" us from the dangers of society, except that they are targeting everything as a potential danger and reading our diaries/phones to get into our thoughts and feelings. does that sound right to you? for me it doesn't. as stupid as this sounds, we need conversation, and this concept has been taken only by their point of view, not ours. another example: i imagine that most of you guys watch pewdiepie, do you guys remember that drama back in 2017-2018 where there was a bunch of articles about pewdiepie that were telling lies and twisting everything he did? well, i remember as well a lot of parents and teachers, supposedly full grow adults with the capacity of acknowledging everything better than we do, telling us to stop watching nazi content... remember that? oh boi. that didn't age well, did it? that's my point. we need to open more this kind of conversations, we need to speak. you're valid. dont let anyone not even your loved ones take that away from you.

wonder ok, so i just read wonder, an amazing book which also has a movie. you may already know about it. this story is fiction, but the moral goes directly to your heart as you read it, and it is now one of my favorite books. i am 12, just to let you know. this book is for anyone from ages 13 and higher, i just have 1 year of difference hehe, but i still wanted to read and sicover a little bit. spoiler alert 🚨 it tells a story of a kid named august pullman, who was born with a medical face problem. his face is deformed, and since that happened, he was home-schooled. with her mom, who is a teacher. when fifth grade is arriving, his mom decides to send him to an actual school, so that he can get used to friends, classes and teachers. she doesn't talk to him about the idea yet, but his dad agrees. august discovered the secret by himself, and was very unhappy to go to an actual school, because people would bully him and he would not feel comfortable. fifth grade arrives, and august is forced to go to and start middle school. "this year is when middle school begins, so you will not be the only new kid in your class" told him her mother. he although wore an astronaut helmet, so kids couldn't see his face. his father let him, but on,y the first day. this helmet had a great story behind it. august's sister, olivia, has a best friend since she was in kindergarten, miranda. when august had an early age birthday, miranda gave him this helmet, so then he didn't have to worry about being embarrassed. ok... i'm telling the story until here. why? 1. i don't want to spoil u more, it's better if u read it urself, trust me ;). or u can watch the movie, too. 2. i'm sooo tired of typing 😩 hehe have a great day, hope this post has helped you or either inspired u to read it.	0

he (m28) has a gf (f25) but still looks at me (f24) 🤨 he religiously views all my instagram stories (even the long ones) whenever i post something. he's stopped liking my pictures because he has a gf now. i know he reads my writing on my instagram stories because he ends up voting in the polls for things he agrees and disagrees on. anyways. we met once almost 2 years ago. every once in a while he'd want to hang out but wouldn't put much effort in and neither would i so we just never ended up meeting up ever again. we just wanted something casual. i knew he thought i was pretty cool but he ghosted me 2 years ago like 2 weeks after our first date since i to him seemed to want something more serious and he wasn't ready. he's definitely the handsome player type. anyways i dropped him cuz that was a dick move but then months later he followed me on instagram wanting to hang out, go to the beach, do thing etc. plans kept falling through cuz i was busy then he was busy etc. but he'd try at least every 2-3 months to see me again (very low effort though from how it was before our first date). anyways he got very close to this girl. literally a day before making her his gf and finding "the love of his life" (he's known and fucked this girl way before he knew me) he booty called me. it was the perfect segway because i broke my old phone and asked people to text me their names to my phone number. he quickly did that in hopes of a booty call. this is what the booty call looked like: hey cutie. its _______ btw. (inserted pic of himself) oh hey! how have you been? hope you're keeping warm. good just bbqing. i'm a bit cold do you have a cure for that? hmmmm warm yummy tea or activities that make you sweat 😜🤷🏼‍♀️ i could deff use some instructions if you're down ;) sorry i only fuck people i know well and vibe with, and i don't know you well. i'm sure you'll be able to find someone! have so much fun ☺️ i did thank you 😉 have fun cutie aaaayyy perfect 🤙you too babe. (what kind of person says "i did thank you" to respond to that? lol) **tl;dr**: since then he's constantly watching my stories. especially because he knows i have 3somes with this beautiful woman and there's a guy now that could have been him. my life is very casual right now because i don't want something serious. **why not delete me if you have a gf?** i'm not a person a gf would want their bf to be viewing their stories and posts.	0
