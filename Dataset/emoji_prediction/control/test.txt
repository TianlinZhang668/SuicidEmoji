i (23f) recently matched with a guy on bumble (24m) who is a terrible texter. is this indicative of his interest? i recently matched with this guy on bumble. at first we had really interesting text conversations. we've gone on two dates, both of which we really clicked, the second date we fooled around. (probably too soon i know.) after the second date, his texts have been maybe 5 words. mostly just teasing, nothing serious. and he will send me maybe two texts a day, where as before it was more often. i suggested hanging out again and he said yes but he was busy for now. after a little more texting, i decided to stop texting him for a while and see if he noticed. after a day of not texting, he finally texted me and said "sorry i know i tease too much " which i then replied. is this a bad sign? tl;dr: met a guy who seems really compatible with me. after fooling around, his texts are short and for between. are texts indicative of interest?	😅
a little rant about my german teacher. i don't like her at all, to be honest. it's so cringey when the dialogue of our lesson has to do with a girlfriend or a boyfriend, and when she talks about it she just referrs to them as a "friend". like, what's the matter? she platonicizes literally everything, everytime. oh, and she calls my name wrong, and she also spells it wrong. we have another person who shares the same first name as me, so people refer to me by my first name, and last name, which is what's supposed to happen, but, no! instead, she refers to me by my first name (written in a shitty wrong way) and then, guess what, my father's name! what the hell?!	😀
can't sleep been trying to fall asleep for an hour with no luck. figured i would try and see if anyone was down to talk for awhile. if you're down just pm me	👍
can i just say, seeing your pet age is kind of sad :( i have a year and a half old hamster (life expectancy is around 2 years) and over the last 6 months, i've noticed the physical signs of aging. he used to be able to run 5-7hrs a night on his wheel, and now he only runs maybe an hour or two. when i first got him, he was sable (a darkish grey-brown, almost black) with some white/cream spots around his eyes, his tummy, and paws. now his fur comes in light brown and white. thankfully he's still healthy but still... why do pets live such short lives?	😭
other people wish they had relationships i wish i had a friendship [god kelly you were my only friend you didn't have to block me]	😎
grieving and streaming so i have been developing a place for the people in this sub or anyone else who needs it. it's a twitch channel. my son and i were gamers and had made plans to game and stream and create cool videos for youtube. that can't happen now. after 4 months of crying, i decided to stand up and start this project. i will be streaming 4-5 nights a week from my sons computer, with his mic and webcam. while i will game certain games (not fortnite ), i would like to be available for anyone who is grieving or has knowledge on the subject. a place you can tune in and chat with me or others in the stream about these kinds of things. i'm hoping we can give each other support and advice on standing back up, trying to move again and, just, breathing through the hard times. the first week for me back then was incredibly hard (as i'm sure you all know). one thing that helped was a face-to-face conversation with another person who understood the feelings i was having (from personal experience). even a simple phone conversation with another person helped in ways i can't really adequately describe. so i've created a way to hopefully help others. if anyone wants to chat or just watch or recommend links i could include on the channel for various resources for others, please do. i think about everyone on this sub every day. search for my handle on twitch or youtube if you want to check it out or leave suggestions. you can also dm me on here. i check it every day. try and breathe friends	🙄

just gave a presentation after a car accident so i don't know if i should be proud or not but last night i stayed up till 12 am working on a presentation for school my mom let me sleep in 40 minutes and drove me to school, i was super tired but excited to present because i was very proud of my presentation i had created. a few blocks from the school i heard tires squealing then the car jolted forward and made a loud noise, the next few minutes i was in shock and didn't know what happened. i heard my mom screaming and crying and swearing and i realized we were in a car accident. a few extra details, i now know that i have a concussion, and i made it worse by getting out of the car as soon as i was hit and trying to help the other people involved. i was eating yogurt and when i was hit it flew all over me and into my hair. my hair is naturally curly (i had it straightened) and it was raining so it was frizzy and covered in yogurt. after the police and medics got there i was told i should go home and rest or go to the doctor, i told my dad that i needed to do my presentation and he agreed to drive me to the school. i stormed into the classroom, covered in rain, leaves, and yogurt, and the teacher excused my absence. he told me he wanted me to go to the nurse ( and the nurses were calling the classroom to check me out). i told him i wasn't leaving till i gave that presentation and after arguing and begging he said "you're crazy" and gave my presentation (everyone likes it) and now i'm recovering	😎

my bosses 14 year old son has been getting caught lighting fires in the house at night. i personally find this hilarious only because it's not my kid. apparently he sneaks around the house gathering random supplies he'll need but of course the smell of smoke always gets him caught in the end. the parents are baffled at why he being so secret about it because the mother is a legit scientist and would encourage experimenting in a more controlled environment of course. just had to share parenting sounds like a trip lol	😂

married born-again christian guy (29(?)/m) keeps hitting on me (26/f), do i tell his wife? so a little backstory, i used to work with this guy about a year and a half ago. he didn't stick around for long because he wound up getting fired for some reason i don't know. i remember not really liking him much because he'd come in with this "i know everything" attitude and i found him a little annoying. we were never close, but i'm a pretty friendly person so i wouldn't completely ignore him if he was working near me or if he tried to have casual conversation or whatever. we follow each other on ig and we're friends on fb because basically everyone at work is and when he got fired i didn't bother to unfollow him, cause whatever i didn't really care. so anyway, he got married shortly after he stopped working with me and i just went about my life. one thing i do remember very clearly about this dude is he was suuuuuuper religious. like one of those born-again, but like hipster born-again christians. he was always talking about going to church at hillsong, which is a really big church where i live (like auditorium size, thousands of people big). he wouldn't try to press his beliefs on others, but was very candid about the fact that he was very religious, abided by christian values, etc. i remember him saying his wife (fiancee at the time) was also a member of the church and very religious. i personally am not religious, but i don't care about what other people choose to believe in. so, cut to like a couple months ago. i hadn't spoken to this guy or seen him since he stopped working with me and he started replying to my ig stories in my dms. i honestly didn't think much of it because of what i remembered about him in a general sense, i really was thinking there's no way he was trying to hit on me, just being nice or whatever. i'm not one for getting easily offended or thinking others are coming onto me just for interacting with me, or even necessarily complimenting me. his ig is full of photos of him and his really beautiful wife looking extremely happy, and i'm also in a happy relationship and engaged to be married so i didn't take it as anything. he would send me emojis, like if he thought something was funny or whatever, really nothing crazy. a couple times slightly commenting on my appearance, or outfit, but still nothing too overt. i still found him annoying, even more so when he started interacting with me, so i basically ignored it. something i think is pretty relevant... i'm basically the opposite of him when it comes to what people usually perceive about me. i'm covered in tattoos, i'm really candid, outgoing, not at all conservative. i tend to post slightly revealing photos sometimes on my ig. i'm not like an *influencer\~\~\~** or anything weird like that, but i like my damn body and hell i like to be cute sometimes, so fuck it! i also recently got a breast augmentation and didn't hide that fact because it was obvious. unsurprisingly, it was around the same time that was all happening he started talking to me. so, a couple nights ago - i posted a photo on ig where you could see cleavage. he sent me back my own photo in my dms and said "exercising jedi levels of thirst control". so, officially he is definitely flirting with me. it grosses me out on a lot of levels. i sent him back a confused face, and he sent me back the *shhhh* emoji. normally, if i didn't know some dude and he did that on ig i would just ignore it. however, i find this guy to be particularly annoying, and on top of it he's walking around pretending to be some holier than thou person and dragging his wife, who i have heard may as well be a damn saint, through the mud. one thing that i can't stand more than anything is when people cheat, i just hate it. i've been cheated on and it hurt so fucking bad, i wouldn't wish that on anybody. i think that his wife deserves to know what he's up to, and i'm sure that if he's flirting with me that i'm probably not the only girl. he could be doing more than that, who knows! i just know i wouldn't want to be her, and if i were her i would want to get out, or at least know. i talked to a friend/coworker of mine who was closer with him when we all worked together, he was a member of their church and knows his wife as well. he also thinks i should talk to his wife, and he gave me her number. i just don't know if it's the right thing to do even though a huge part of me wants to. i'm mostly scared of retaliation more than anything, even though i don't even know what he would be able to do. i guess my biggest fear is since he knows the company i work for, he could make up some crazy stuff about me and try to get me fired or something. i don't think it would work cause i'm really good at my job and there's nothing to hold over my head, but i don't want his bullshit overflowing into my life. i also don't know what to say to her, how to tell her. should i call her, text her, just not and how do i approach it if i do? **tl;dr: guy i used to work with has gradually been flirting with me more and more on ig, friends think i should tell his wife, he also goes around telling people about how much he follows christian values and is born again. what to do?**	😂
had a quadshot coffee a few hours ago and my ears are still ringing but i feel good so everything is alright	😀

a romantic slo-mo after 8 years today is a usual day. my boyfriend and i spent the day with our friends in a cafe laughing and enjoying the company. after we decided to eat dinner alone so we can spend time together. we ate at a fast-food chain. i wasn't feeling good so he volunteered to line up and buy our food and i picked a table for us. i was sitting for a good 2 minutes when i turned around just wanting to check on him and in my surprise he also turned around at the same time to check on me. it was like in movies when everything's fading out and in slow motion. all i can hear is my heartbeat beating faster than ever and all i can see is his smile when he realized that we turned around at the same time. it's been 8 years for us but i am still very infatuated and very much in love with my boyfriend.	❤️

i asked her out! asking women out is a rarity for me, but this one was so interesting that i figured i'd kick myself if i didn't just give it a shot. we work at the same company (gigantic company) and we've met at social events and talked on a few occasions. we're also both recent college graduates in a workforce dominated by older married dudes. anyway, i asked her via im. we'll call her jenny. we'll also make up some fake restaurant called "bbq paradise". here's the gist of the conversation: me: morning jenny! how's work going? jenny: morning! not bad, and yourself? me: here and there. i wanted to tell you about this great bbq restaurant i know of called bbq paradise. heard of it? jenny: nope. were you thinking about having lunch there today? me: dinner actually! maybe we can go some time after work if you're free. jenny: good idea! i'll let the friend group know, they've been dying for some good bbq. me: haha, i was thinking more along the lines of a date, but if you'd rather go as a group that's fine. jenny: oh! sorry, i had no idea! but i think it'd be a great place for all of us to visit as a group. me: haha, definitely check it out when you can! it's pretty good. [unrelated small talk follows] so yeah, that's basically how it went. kinda feel like drinking bleach because i was *really* interested in her, but i'll probably get over it in a few days. at least she let me down pretty easy and nothing blew up in my face. she's still pretty fond of me after this, but clearly just as friends. so that's my tuesday in a nutshell. posting this here in hopes that someone else feels a little better about their own day after reading about my fiasco.	😅

posting an opinion on reddit for the first time.. tl;dr at the end so i am unfortunately a lurker i love reddit because i had got bored of facebook and constantly scrolling through boring posts about the same old drap things from mostly people i don't talk to anymore but can see far too much detail about their lives. (that's a social media beef and not to do with this post) reddit was introduced to me by my brother as a good alternative and i have spent the last few months scrolling here instead but as i said mostly as a lurker. i did create one meme but it wasn't allowed due to my zero karma. i decided to write a post about a mobile game i play and how disappointed i was with the direction it was heading. suggested that people may follow me and stop playing it to send a message to the devs......big mistake. my first ever comment came in and it was a here here i too don't like the changes and an upvote or two. yay for me maybe i'll get some karma. now i didn't expect too many people to see it unless they sorted by new but then comes the crunch 2 fellow redditors gave me a ear full for trying to ruin a game for them by hating on it and suggested i was searching for validation for quiting. the end result? i now have -1 karma that will teach me tifu by attempting to stop being a lurker and post an opinion on the internet tl;dr tifu by posting my thoughts hoping for karma and getting schooled as to why i should have kept my mouth shut	😂
guys, i don't know if this should be the happiest day of my life or not yet so i told the girl i like how i feel for her, asked if she felt the same. she responded with "yes, you're dear to me too ". what do it mean fr i'm stoked and feel like throwing my guts out but confused	😊
i'm overthinking a simple question to a "friend" hey! so i reaaallyyyy like this girl. the other day she joked about how after her last exam on tuesday anyone can feel free to bring her food. (she didn't think anyone was listening when she said it) so i had the idea that i'd buy her some of her favourite snacks but i don't actually know how word it when i want to bring them to her. like "hey i got you some food are you around?" everything i think of sounds cringy and i'm definitely overthinking this. i'm super nervous around her and don't want her to think i'm weird. if someone could help me word this that would be amazing. :))	🙃

people never talk to me... i've had this sudden realisation that people do not talk to me unless i make the first contact. it sucks, it makes me feel lonely. i'm a social person, i don't have anxiousness when it comes to conversations, but i've noticed that my conversations are 80/20 (in which i do most of the talking). i've drifted away from a couple of people because of this. funnily enough, they don't go out of their way to talk to me once i've done this. i haven't done anything offensive, nosy or manipulative, so why am i being treated like this? i don't get it...	😔
real life in italy. not 3rd world today i started talking with the shoes shop holder, never met before, when a 25 cm mouse (rat?) spawned running he slipped into the shop door as he d been confortable. i took a wooden swype to help the man get out the mouse. at 5 meters a cat front to a butchery didn give a shit. i also have a pic of the cat. its name is garfield and its a common orange striped puss cat soriano.	😀
i realized i was "officially" an adult last night when i checked the weather to see if it was going to rain or if i needed to water my plants. <_< there's no turning back now! edit: i see this has hit the front page and now a bunch of smartasses are showing up and taking it way too literally haha. edit 2: 90% get what i'm saying, but for the ones that don't: i'm not saying "weeee look at me, i'm an adult now!" but rather referring to the fact that such a mundane thought makes me feel old, whereas when i was a kid this would've been the last thing on my mind. that's all, reddit police, so you can settle down now.	😂

i [22f] love him [23m] but don't get along with his friends tldr; the title of this post. how do i deal? can i? long backstory ahead: my boyfriend, oliver, and i have been seeing each other for a little under a year at this point. we met in college and we have so much fun together basically living together (3 days at my place, 3 at his every week), traveling, eating out and just generally enjoying each other's company. standard relationship fare. we have one major problem which is his friends. i don't get along with some of them. one of them recently just stirred up drama yesterday. we'll call her penelope. oliver is friends with penelope because they went to high school together. i don't think they actually have a lot in common. they hang out very infrequently (twice last year despite not living very far from each other) and when i've asked him why they're friends, all he said was "she's nice and was a cool girl in high school." it doesn't help that they hooked up early on in college as this makes me definitely feel a little territorial around her even though she's engaged. the first time (and so far only time in person) i met her this past december, i admit that i came in on a high horse. she didn't ask me anything about me, so i got a little butthurt and asked her why she was getting married so young. i'm blunt and very to the point, but again, i admit that this had a judgmental jab in it. later, before new years, i tried to extend an olive branch. i had oliver text her letting her know that if she needed ceremony music, i'd be happy to help (i've been playing classical violin my whole life and have done wedding gigs since i was 10). she texted back politely declining and added that she had felt attacked when we had met. he did his best to keep the peace (offering a quasi apology on my behalf while also defending me "sorry you felt attacked, she didn't mean it in a negative way really; she's just blunt"). fast forward to valentine's day, oliver took a zumba class with me. we had actually had a fight over this as he originally didn't want to take the class with me because he felt emasculated and i was hurt by that. we discussed it a lot before he agreed with my pov. i filmed a bit of him dancing in class because i was proud and posted it to my story on instagram. she responded with "i'm dying ". i replied back sharing a bit of my struggle with him because i'm trying to bond with her, and that's what i would've shared with my own friends about my life/relationship. she then became patronizing telling me that i shouldn't be offended that he didn't want to dance because it's just not who he is. i replied explaining that i was more upset because he actually admitted that he was feeling emasculated which for me, is basically sexist and how it does make me wonder if we're compatible in the long run. then she made this long comment about how coming off strong never changes anyone's mind with some more patronizing advice. i was furious now and let her know that how she said what she did was not only patronizing, but also evident that she didn't read what i had written: he and i had calmly discussed the zumba issue! she apologized, i accepted and we wished each other a happy valentine's day. yesterday, 3 weeks after the ig conversation, she texts oliver out of nowhere asking if he knew of our ig conversation. he was with me the whole time it was happening and read my messages to her before i even sent them. oliver told her "yes, i saw" and she asked why he wasn't upset that i had insulted him. again, he did a good job at keeping the peace (i wasn't insulted because her being harsh means she cares, but thanks for having my back, penelope). she goes "ok. i just wanted to give you a heads up because she was ranting and what did she want me to do, agree with her? i figured i would warn you but i guess if you know and you're okay with it... as long as she doesn't flat out try to change you and force her opinions on you." he assured her i don't/won't. i found the whole thing incredibly disrespectful. to both oliver, as in not trusting that he can make his own decisions, and our relationship as a whole. i get that she's maybe coming from an angle of concerned friend, but i don't feel like it's her place at all. i feel like this would be really weird if she were single. she also could've just been like "hey! just checking that you're happy in your relationship" rather than claiming that i had insulted him because i didn't and trying to subtly insinuate that i'm a controlling bitch. i get really mad thinking about the whole thing because i want to confront her and let her know how i feel about this whole thing. i think oliver handled it really well between them, but i want to make all these ridiculous boundaries like "you can't hang out with her 1 on 1." besides therapy, how else do i get over wanting to make oliver choose between me and penelope? how do i process feeling like she's trying to undermine me and my relationship? i think i feel really torn because a part of me feels obligated to be her friend as he claims she's a big part of his life, ie. if oliver and i were to get married, he would invite her to the wedding. i get that a part of me feeling threatened is probably because i don't feel the most secure in my relationship, and another part is because i feel like it says oliver and i don't have compatible values if he's friends with people i don't get along with. it's really tearing me apart right now and by extension, my relationship with oliver. i will gladly take reminders to sit down and be humble, and even more gladly take vindication comments that she overstepped. regardless, i'm sure there's plenty of context that i'm leaving out that i'd be happy to supply in comments or in a pm. thanks for taking the time to delve into my petty personal drama today.	😂
took 3 whole minutes for y'all to post smh i'd do it myself but i'm not entertaining	😔
tifu by telling my kid she doesn't have to hug people. i read somewhere that i shouldn't make my kid hug people. i thought about it and decided "i wouldn't want to hug ____ either. this is a great article." i then told her- "look, you have choices, you don't have to hug everyone. if you don't want to hug someone you just need to try and be nice about it, so instead of ew try i'm just not a hugger...". everything was going fine until i tried to hug her goodnight a few days later and she said "mom, i've already had to to tell all my friends that i'm not a hugger. i am not a hugger. stop trying to hug me." she's 5. my 5 year old won't hug me anymore and i've brought it on myself.	😩

landed a canvassing job that hopefully will be paying well! all this week, i had to commit to memory *many* scripts to be ready for the field. the pay is..11/hr for training (mon-fri, we're done) out in the field, 14/hr + $85 for every person you can get to say "yes" to a *free quote*. after a few weeks, $17/hr baseline. on average, other canvassers are doing ~$30/hr. top producers making ~$40+/hr. not a bad job for a 19 year old coming from wendy's	😁

sad realization hi reddit i just realized that i have no dreams, no aspirations, no life target and no core values (besides maybe "do no harm"), and almost no emotions... and, although it is sad fact per se, that does not make me sad.	🙃

my friend gave me a lottery scratcher as a present today. i thought i had won $5000, turned out to be a prank. my best friends and i started a not-so-secret santa trade off last year and this year the cap was $30. so one of the gifts from my friend was a scratch-off where if i matched 3 dollar amounts, i would win that prize. when i scratched it, it revealed three $5000 values. i got so excited and ran to tell my mom and she got so excited too. i look at the back to go sign it, but as i'm looking at the fine print, it revealed it was a gag and my friend was recording the reaction the whole time. he got me so good... but the silver lining here is that for my friends that don't this friend on snapchat, they actually think i won $5000 so i get in a prank of my own this christmas	😂
have a safe holiday, everyone happy thanksgiving! what are your plans today? i'm going to a local church to eat a nice meal, then later today i am spending time with my older sister watching movies and making cookies! drive safe everyone, we all have something to lose. please keep safety a number one priority especially for those of you going pre-black friday shopping. don't get too crazy!	😂
trying to outsmart my shower... so on today's episode of "champagne taste on a beer/malt whiskey budget".... i have not had a bathtub in 6 years. i love my home, but having an extremely stressful job has had me plenty of times yearning for some warm, liquid stress relief. for the past 6 months, every time i've been in my little stall shower, i have been scheming of a way to cheaply turn it into a make-shift bathtub. i started researching on amazon, and found that there is an entire population of people who refuse to bathe in hotel/rental property baths, unless they have a plastic sheet to cover the said bath. it cost $11 for 5 of these bath sheets. i immediately started thinking of the "what ifs" that could happen with this idea if i purchased these sheets. and in my defense, i knew the biggest issue in this low budget experiment would be the weight of the water that pressed on the push door of my stall shower as it filled up with the said water. but nevertheless, i persisted, and strove to obtain that sweet, sweet ecstasy of taking a nice, warm, stress-relieving bath...and thought duct tape would be sturdy enough to keep the door sealed. i sat in the well of my cold, sterile-white shower, as it slowly filled the awkward "bath bag" with distractingly warm water. every inch of success further teased me with the thought that i actually might get to experience a real, relaxing bath after 6 years of deprivation. the water slowly passed my ankle. after 5 minutes, i could see it passing my knee cap. "oh, my god" i thought, "this is the best $11 i've ever spent! i can't believe i am outsmarting my shower!" and then within literally half of a second, exactly what i was hoping wouldn't happen, happened faster than the speed of light...the shower door burst open, my beautiful, plentiful bath of water proceeded to drain like niagara falls....water everywhere, me sitting in an awkward state of shock, naked in a plastic bag, mind you....just wondering how this ended up being my friday night. so, lol, happy friday to all of you, i sure hope you are having a warmer, drier, and much better night than i am. i guess me and baths just aren't meant to be tldr: i turned my stall shower into a bathtub for 3 minutes...gravity won, water everywhere.	😂

i just need to feel validated. minor trigger warning- i do mention suicide and some other possibly triggering topics i am 13 years old, rather young to be here, but i put myself through hell everyday and no one cares because im "faking it, just like everyone else my age." i don't have any friends to talk about because my friendships are always so chaotic, i go from idolizing them to despising them, to feeling like they despise me and will leave me every time i talk to them, and i always end up shutting them out. its so exhausting because i do that with everyone i care about, and i can't take it very well. my school has been online, and it will be until late january, and it's so difficult because i need a connection with other people, and online school has left me unmotivated, anxious, and empty. theres been times where ive been suicidal, and its become more common everyday. im sensitive to everything, physically and emotionally, and it's often too much. i don't trust anyone close to me with my mental health, i feel like im too much, but also not enough at the same time. im scared they wont support me and try to get away from me, especially that im queer in a homophobic, religous conservative household. everything is so intense and i cant take it anymore. all of these recent events, even in the past 2 years have taken my life from me, and i dont know what to do, i just need someone to empathize and show they care. thanks, please leave a response, id really appreciate it	😊
do you know me? jk, i already know you know me	😎

i can't go out for movies because i'm not "old enough" so i wanted to go out for a regular movie with my friends. you know, a night out and maybe some dinner later, with my school friends. but the thing is, i have parents. super-duper overprotective parents. i asked them if i could go for a movie. they started telling me how when they were young they weren't allowed to go for m18 movies and shit like that. here's the catch: i'm 14, and the movie i wanna go for is spiderman: far from home. they don't even let me go for that. i was like what the fuck, its just a marvel movie. but no. they asked who was going. i told them that it was just me and my school friends with a few girls that i was close to(not girlfriends tho). when i told them this, they started telling me about how i could end up having sex and getting girls pregnant without consent and how this could lead to me doing drugs like cocaine and meth and stuff like that. then they said i would become part of a gang and could end up in jail or something. but what the fuck? it was a fucking spiderman movie that was rated pg. they said that my friends were bad influences and should stay away from them. again, what the fuck? they knew my friends' parents so well. they knew all my friends and all the girls that went, but still it was a no. i really don't know what to do guys. sometimes i just feel like jumping off a cliff or something. this honestly sucks so much because it's happened so many times that even my friends know that i have shit parents. i've practically never gone out with my friends. i just feel like fucking killing myself	😭

a quick tale of my life sooo i'm 31 and i never... ever had fun by myself, alone, solo. never went to the movies by myself or managed to eat at a restaurant alone without feeling miserably lonely and feeling stupid. whenever i got out for a walk/jogging i'd think something along the lines of "wft am i doing? i must look really stupid and uncomfortable". i was never able to simply enjoy a walk, i was always rushing to be somewhere, felt i was wasting time. i felt like nothing made sense, i couldn't feel satisfaction from anything. i felt like a fluke, like no one would like me as a friend because i'm always all over the place and overthinking, and driving people away. for as long as i can remember i felt lonely and wanted to die. i never felt i belonged somewhere. a strong sense of rejection always populated my mind and heart, i felt i was missing out on what my friends were doing, like i wasn't good enough and i didn't know how to "properly enjoy life". so i always tried to make up with these feelings by working a lot, that way i felt i was at least being productive. aaand after all this time, this week i finally understood what it means to do stuff i like for myself and not for others. i gotta say it took a considerable amount of effort and tears. i've been thinking and questioning and facing my demons for a year now. instead of trying to distract myself with netflix or games or food or friends, i just laid there staring at the ceiling and trying to understand what i was running away from. turned the cellphone off when i was not working and just spent days feeling lonely and miserable... until i wasn't anymore. nothing made sense for most of the time, and still doesn't... but i eventually found peace with myself. i stopped running from myself and accepted that i am also a person. i embraced my fears and faced them head on. i'm really proud of myself and truly enjoying the present moment. i was able to recognize my qualities and see myself as a human being. a human being that deserves care and love... self-love finally makes sense. meditation makes sense, mindfulness, treating yourself well, putting your well-being above work or other people's concerns. it's not "don't give a fuck" like some say, it's more like "give fucks to what really is important". know why you're alive and breathing. there are things only you can do. maybe good things for yourself, your family, your community. our lifetime is limited and the clock is running, but understand no one has control over it. some people will try to show the world they're doing great (they're probably not) and some will mind their own business and not worry about appearances, they will respect themselves and live a fullfilled life, for their own sake. they will struggle for their own well-being and for what they need/desire in life. love yourself. it feels guuuuuud and it finally makes sense to be alive. i don't want to die anymore. that's all i wanted to say. thank you for reading, i hope you eventually find peace of mind as well.	😊

fuck writing essays they're so annoying and take so long to write i've wasted an hour just writing a few sentences. i was hoping to make up all my missing school work today but it's taking forever just to do this one essay	😔
thinking my boss had already left work. obligatory, this happened last night. i work in retail so my hours are all over the place. my boss is a super conservative, older, religious lady. also i should mention, i'm kind of a huge pot head. just about every day i make a little jar of cannabutter to take to work with me and i put it on my food on my lunch break. it's gets me through the last part of my day and really helps with the pain of being on my feet all day. last night i ordered a pizza for my workers from the place next door. when i went to pick the pizza up my boss clocked out, said she was leaving, and walked out the door. i got my pizza, came back to work, got my jar of cannabutter, got a slice, slathered a good heaping portion onto the first bite, and then decided to wash my hands. i'm literally less than a minute in the bathroom washing my hands and i walk out into the break room to my boss chomping down on the pizza that i dosed. apparently she came back for a slice of pizza. she had a god awful look on her face and she said it was the greasiest (is that a word?) pizza she's ever had and it tasted weird . fast forward to 2 hours later, she calls in and says she's feeling very ill, that she thinks the pizza was bad, and that she is going to need me to work for her tomorrow. my day off. so here i am getting dressed for work on my day off. my only day off in a month. tl;dr i fucking dosed my boss on edibles and lost my day off	😳
i just got confessed to by 3 guys tonight that they like me it's currently 1:30am so when i wake up, i wonder if this post was just a figment if my imagination because no way is this real, literally never happens to me anyway night guys	😂
why risk it when you can play it safe... that's one of the most common decisions people have to make everyday. if you ask me i say that you risk it. why?, let me elaborate. if you play safe all the time,the only things that can happen are the things that you know will definitely happen, and what's the fun in that? when you risk it and make unconventional decisions, one of two things can happen. 1. the decisions works out great, or 2. it's the wrong decision. when its right decision, it's all good and when its the wrong one, you have an opportunity to learn from it and grow. so, yeah if you feel like doing the riskier way ,go for it. p.s. bad grammar edit: apparently when you use the word "play", it automatically is a post about gaming.	🙃
bruh this is oversharing but i shaved down there and as a result there was an ingrown hair and im in pain	😔
positive irl interaction including dog! i make myself walk for an hour daily, (i've mad anxiety and developed agoraphobia). i've had several awful comments. but tonight i had a really nice exchange. a lady was walking her aged golden retriever without a lead. she bumped into some friends as i was passing by (i walk fast) so, she stopped, and slowly continued in the same direction. by this time the gorgeous dog and i are side by side, but a road was coming up.. so i slowed down (he'd sped up to match my pace) and asked if he knew to stay with her/stop if i crossed. she was super appreciative- even though he wouldn't cross (and he didn't!) it was nice having a positive moment for a change on that street! what are some of your positive one off moments when you've been out?	😊

is this s good message to my ex? okay to start i'm [17m] only sending this if she [18f] texts me first, other than that it is just a way for me to vent. "she" is her friend that manipulates her and hates me for some reason. she left me a voicemail after i told ex we could not be friends and that she was a bad friend to my ex. the voicemail was really rude so i said something out of line about how she threatens to kill her self for attention. i know it was wrong to bring it up even if i think it is true. i apologized but got a "fuck you" in return. at exs birthday party before this somone told me she said "i hate that kid" and it was for no reason i did not even speak to her. and i did not retaliate evan is her current boyfriend/talker, who lives a state away that dated her for a year and a half about 4 years ago. i guess she needed a male to talk to after breaking up with me and he was the closest and they got closer idk. but she thinks he likes her more than he actually does, she has romanticized their past. she went to his prom with him recently she told me she has never disregarded my feelings but dumped me 3 weeks before prom when she asked me to go to prom in october to try to get her back i wrote her a letter and gave it to her at her birthday party (not on her birthday) and i told her how much she meant to me (at the time) and she never responded to it at all i overheard her calling me a narcissist basically because to make her friend group mad, i say some pretty admittedly pompous stuff like bragging about grades and what not. (not unwarranted her friend group tries to annoy ours too) i got my car taken by my mom and she would not give me a ride home (while we were dating) because i "needed to respect my moms punishment" and i forgot to mention that bit about her not doing the same for her mom when i was in the moment **message** fuck you for making me feel like i did something wrong. this whole time i was thinking i was wrong or i wasn't good enough but now i know it was all you. i'm not saying i'm perfect, but i tried my best to keep our relationship healthy (apologizing, wanting to play tennis so we could have alone time and talk, etc...) and i respected your choices and decisions about yourself and did not mock them like other people in your past have (if you catch my drift) because that's not what i wanted from you. and you chose to keep being irritated, you chose to end our relationship because you are immature and mad. you can justify why you did it in retrospect however you want but you know as well as i do it's not true. i did not change, you did. i cannot help that you are so fickle and wishy washy on your opinion of people (from liking to hating or vice versa in a day), saying god put me in your life because you needed me one week and the next saying you don't enjoy my company and you are my punching bag. i keep my word, and i definitely don't lie to people. but i'm glad you did end it because now i can see how toxic you are. you had me walking on eggshells because you are so sensitive that i knew next time you were mad you would breakup with me again, like a third grader. like i said, it's like changing shampoo to you. you expect people to treat you like a princess while you walk all over them. you are also a major hypocrite, fake, a liar, easily controlled/manipulated and very selfish. and you should work on those traits, but i know you will never change because you can't ever see when you are wrong. you are always the victim. with your "i've never disregarded your feelings" ass. everything i wrote to you for your birthday is true (doubt you read it). it is true for the girl i thought you were, but you have either changed or were never her in the first place. and sure what i said to her was immature. but i never said anything to her when she convinced you to break up with me in january or when she talked shit about me when we were dating, or even talking shit about me at your birthday party for no reason at all. and i always had a positive opinion of her until you told me she did not like me. i want to get along with everyone but some people don't want to. p.s. evan used to say you were annoying and he hated you and he only kept dating you because your mom drove him to school lmao also i say/said narcissistic stuff to piss people off, not because i think that way. i am well aware of my faults, more than you know. i have even told you some of the things i'm insecure about. but you are just trying to find stuff wrong with me to talk shit about me with your mom like you do literally everyone else. also narcissists don't apologize, but think what you want. when push comes to shove i always try to fix my mistakes remember when you were telling me that, unlike me, you take your moms punishment because you respect her, no matter what it is. well i remembered how when she took your phone because we went to dairy queen, you took it off of the counter. just wanted to remind you of that since you thought you were right **question** so basically i want to make sure this message is as effective as possible at delivering my point. if anything does not make sense or doesn't help my cause let me know please. tldr: need advice on if message is good or not	😊
i'm in love! i'm in love! and i don't care who knows it! i feel like [buddy the elf] (<url>) right now! why? because i finally told this girl why i was upset at her. (she gave off the appearance of forgetting me in a convo with a friend. turns out, she didn't! she was just listing people that she saw with my other friend at a fair with. i can totally explain what happened if the way i worded it makes no sense.) i hadn't talked to her in a month. i got kinda depressed. i grew my beard out. i couldn't sleep at night. but i finally told her! and we're close friends again!	😊

lying to my parents and to the police this event happened several years ago, so not today, however when i found this page i felt forced to share (sorry for being so long, tried to make it as short as possible). i live in switzerland but am from middle-eastern decent. when i was 14 my best friend nick and i started hanging out with an older crowd (16/17 years). these guys were already going out to the biggest club in geneva. (need to be 18 in ch) and kept inviting us to go with them, saying they could get us in through the back door of the club. eventually we agreed to go with them. the plan was that we both tell our parents that we're sleeping at each others place, and stay up till 10 am and go home after (we could never tell our parents we're going clubbing at the age of 14 + are parents know each other but don't regularly speak.) clubs close 5:30/6:00 so we figured we could just hang around until 10 and then simply take the bus home. here's when the fu started. we went to the club as planned and had the best night of our lives. but when we were on the 8 am bus back to our homes (couldn't handle staying up any longer), i realized that i had lost my brand new iphone that my parents got me 2 days before, somewhere in the club. i didn't know what to do cuz i knew my parents would never believe that i lost my phone at my friends house, it's almost impossible. so i had to come up with another lie. i arrived home at 8:30, after a 10 minute walk from the bus station, changed in the garden (i was so nervous they'find out that i even left a bag in the garden with spare cloths), and rang the door bell. as soon as my mom opened i busted into tears saying that i got mugged by a group of 6 people at the bus stop and that they took my phone (great acting skills btw). (i also told her my friend had a private tutoring so needed to leave his place early in the morning). i immediately went up to my room to sleep for a bit. at 11, my mom woke me up and told me she called the police and explained to them everything, and that we had to go see them asap. at this point i was tripping hardcore, but tbh i preferred lying to the police than telling my parents the truth. so i invented a huge story to the police to explain to them what happened, precisely describing the faces of each person, what they said, where and how it happened, etc. even though i was completely shitting my pants, everything seemed to be going well, the police (and my mom) was buying my story. they then asked me which bus i took so they could check the recording of the bus and see if the "muggers" were on same one. i told them the e bus from town. my mom then said "doesn't he live further from town than us"? at this point i needed to lie even more, so i told him nick's parents recently got separated and that his dad is staying at a place close to town". it was a close call, but in the end everyone believed me and the police ended up refunding me the entire price of the iphone (only in switzerland i know ). (and i was very proud of my bullshitting skills). but 10 days later i all went to shit when my mom was on the phone with nick's mom and started saying something along the lines of "i'm so sorry to hear that you and your husband are having troubles". when my mom asked me why i lied about this, i told her that they really are and that she probably didn't want to say it. but this already put some doubt in my mom's head. later on that day, the final blow was dealt. my mom found the spare cloths bag (which i had forgotten about) in the garden, and put the pieces together. she figured everything out, told nick's parents and we both got screwed big time. tl:dr tifu by going clubbing at 14 without telling my parents. ended up loosing my new phone so told them i got mugged, only to find myself lying up lying to the police as well. in the end i got caught because i lied about my best friends parents and forgot a spare "clubbing"cloths bag in the garden.	😂

pre cognitive dreams i've had pre cognitive dreams for years. the earliest i remember is when i was very young, maybe 3 or 4. i remember dreaming of me and my dad laying on the floor looking up and counting these design in the ceiling while also throwing a ball up in the air. some years passed and that exact dream happened in real life and i remembered i had dreamt of it years ago. another example is... i had a dream of me on my computer and clicking on a specific file while talking to rocket league friends. months later that dream became reality and it happened exactly how i dreamt it. the reason i'm posting this is because my friends and family get all confused when i talk to them about it. so i'm wondering if anyone has dreams like this down to the exact finger movement. i've read about pre cognitive dreams but i haven't really seen anything about it happening exactly how i dreamt it.	🤔
i was a total bitch while pregnant. how about you? my husband and i have 3 kids. each time i was pregnant i was a complete and total bitch... towards him. he instantly becomes enemy #1. it's so bad, he knows i'm pregnant before i do! one time we were headed to his brother's house and i berated him over who knows what, so badly, that when we got there he let me out and pulled off at breakneck speeds! i also become an airhead who can't drive. i'm a major nerd but, couldn't follow simple logic and common sense was suddenly not so common. i'd hit any car behind me whenever i backed out of a parking spot........ now that i think about it, my morals got pretty shady, i never left a note! what are some ways you changed during pregnancy?	🙄
hormones possibly making me into a cunt hi, i'm currently taking birth control pills. i haven't really kept up with them because i'm irresponsible. now before someone gets their panties in a bunch, my birth control is strictly to help with painful cramps. not for baby making so blah. i use to have an implant but my body hardcore rejected it. then i got switched to pills due to painful cramping. anyways, i use to be a really nice and patient person (i know that's hard to believe) but now i have the temper of a ticking time bomb. things upset me so easily now. i almost threw my phone against the wall out of frustration today. got into a petty argument with a receptionist. usually, i would let rude remarks go but my claws came out and i was ready to rip her a new one. my overwhelming frustration builds up for no reason sometime. anyone else have this problem? should i look into a new birth control? i was thinking the shot but now i'm considering opting out of any form. i'm not happy with the mean little nugget i've become.	🤔

my (20m) girlfriend (19f) just did something and i don't know how i feel about it. like with many things there's a lot of backstory so i'll try to keep this brief. there's this guy who works with my girlfriend, let's call him a. he's like 23 so it's a bit weird but despite knowing i exist he still asks my girlfriend to go out and stuff so she said she'd meet with him briefly in order to give him a proper talking to and hopefully get the message across that she's not interested. another friend of hers, let's call him b, happened to be in town today and they bumped into eachother before going to get a mcdonald's. i've never liked b much. he's always given me very weird vibes i don't know if he's autistic but i've never felt particularly welcome around him. they get on though so it's fine. anyway she ends up leaving a waiting at the bus stop while herself and b are at mcdonald's for 'a long time'. then she goes to meet a to explain that he needs to back off. b asks if he should stay back and after deliberation she says no so he goes with her. apparently she just ended up waffling to a and didn't get the message out at all. b was just standing there and now apparently a thinks he's her boyfriend (annoying enough as i don't like b) but now i feel bad for a for what she's done to him. keeps him waiting ages and then, considering he thinks b is her boyfriend (she's told him her 'boyfriend', ie me, doesn't like him) is brutally rejected effectively. i don't know how much of this she embellished/left out when she told me, but she feels really bad about it and i don't know whether my current feelings (slightly disgusted, but as understanding as possible) are justified. thanks you lot tl;dr - my girlfriend did something horrid to a guy and used another guy to play as her boyfriend	❤️

showering with my fiance so this happened about 10 minutes ago and i'm still struggling. decided that i wanted to shower with my fiance. was maybe hoping for a bit of sexy doodle time so figured why not. i forgot that my fiance takes burning hot showers (he's a mechanic and he says it's the only way to get the dirt off ) so i hop into the shower with him and stuff is going alright until my feet start to itch. dumb little me forgot that my combo of low blood pressure and bad circulation means hot is bad. so he hops out and goes for a smoke while i finish up washing my hair and stuff. as i hop out of the shower i remember why hot is bad. my hands and feet are burning from the itchiness and heat and i'm insanely lightheaded. as i'm drying off, i almost pass out and and smash my head into the door. i managed to stumble my way to bed so now here i am. the world is spinning, i am in pain, and definitely not going to get some peen tonight. tl;dr: wanted sex, hot shower almost made me pass out, now i don't get sex ):	🙄
to all of the short guys so one of my colleagues at work made a comment at another guy saying "nah he's 5'6' i would never date someone who is not over 6'". i feel like not many girls appreciate shorter guys. in university i remember having a big crush on a guy who was shorter than me (i'm 5'3 and he was 5'2) and what made me attracted to him was the way he made me laugh, the way he took care of his appearance and his caring attitude. so just quickly i just wanted to say, i love short guys. i think you guys are cute and you are also attractive. trust me, there are girls out there who don't care about your height	❤️

tifu: the time i'm finally lucky this just happened about 30 minutes ago. so quick backstory: my boyfriend always buys lotto tickets when he comes and visits me and always gets $50, $100, he's even won $5000 once, i one the other hand never ever win shit. at all. not even $1. you get the picture. well here's where i thought i fucked up: so he's broke but wants a few scratchers, i'm not much better off but he drove here and put up with my crazy family so i take pity. i go in and buy 5 different amount ones which he then jokingly whined about because they weren't the right ones. anyways he starts scratching and this fucker won $150! off one. i about died. he's giddy as a fuck over there and i'm over here pissy. well he goes to cash them in and the actual fuck up happened to him! he scratched a letter not there and in all reality it was $30. lmao. we're now both upset but laughing at how stupid we were a few minutes ago well now i know to next time scan before we think we won tl;dr my lucky ass bf won $150 off scratchers i bought him out of pity whilst i never ever win but in all reality he fucked up and he only won $30 because he fucked up his math.	😂

my boyfriend [18 m] forgot to kiss me [18 f] at midnight on nye last night my boyfriend and i spent new years with a group of friends at a friends house. when it came time for the nye ball drop we all stood around the tv screaming the countdown. when the countdown finished we all screamed happy new years and our friends who are dating kissed right next to us but my boyfriend just looked at me for a moment then looked away and went on to ignore me. it took him about 5 minutes to realize he'd forgotten and he only realized what he did when i ran out of the room. his reaction was to tell me that i should have reminded him to kiss me and that nye midnight kisses aren't any more special than any other kiss. i'm not really sure what to do or what this means or if i should even be upset about this but i'm quite sad and i can't even bring myself to look at him still. if anyone has experienced this before or has any advice on what to do or what this means that would be amazing summary (tl;dr): my boyfriend completely forgot about kissing me at midnight on nye and i'm not sure what this means or what to do or if i should even be upset. any advice anyone has would be greatly appreciated	❤️

how do i get back into a habit? how do you keep a habit going or get it started once you've started slacking? i used to meditate twice a day every day in early high school, and i felt such a peace and inner tranquility, unparalleled to anything i may have ever felt . i occasionally meditate now, but the last serious session i had was when i meditated into the new year for 1 hour (so, a long time ago). i'm aware that small everyday actions can be considered meditative, but i'd like to get back into the actual practice.	🤔

i have to say that growing up, i expected who pays for drinks on dates to be far more important than it turned out to be is this anyone else's experience? i'm a guy. i don't think i've ever been on a date where she wasn't at least somewhat eager to pay for a round then and now. and (at least from what i can tell ) it's never gone poorly or even worse as a result of not paying for all the drinks.	😂
a little confused but i'm okay! so my ex girlfriend broke up with me over a week ago, said i was so perfect and that we moved too fast and couldn't progress as a couple. i was devastated beyond belief because i really, really liked this girl. it's still hard to wrap my head around her leaving but only a week later i'm in a solid place and feel alright! she did state that she wanted to remain friends and still contacts me every night by text and we have a nice/short convo and she ends up leaving me on read. it's nice and all to talk to her but it brings up old feelings of hurt when i've made good progression from the breakup so if she contacts me again tonight i'll most likely just leave her on read. i still keep hopes up that she'll maybe want to get back together one day but i understand the dangers of that and i continue to move forward and meet other women despite of that hope. this situation all reminds me too much of my ex had she felt slightly off about me and ended up breaking up with me and then coming back to me a year later with incredibly strong feelings for me. it's a long story what happened with that but i think i'll always have feelings for that girl but this current ex, damn just disappointed, like i seriously worked very, very hard for her! always thought of ways i could be treating her even better yet i get shit on still oh well i'm doing okay guys and just wanted to let my story be heard! feel free to say whatever you'd like:)	😂

when was the moment you knew it was time to end the relationship? hey all i'm [37f] just asking out of curiosity. i know people have a tendency to either let go too soon or let go too late. personally i'm in camp old fashioned where i believe that a good relationship requires effort and communication. most times i trust my gut to tell me if its time to leave. like an eureka moment. i never had a relationship that lasted more then 4 years so i'm wondering also if i did the right thing or was i too hasty. what about you guys? i'm super curious to know. tldr: when was the moment or fight that you knew you had to leave a relationship? asking because i'm wondering if i took too long or left too early. (repost cos of tldr)	😊
how open is your relationship with your so? i (f23) recently got out of a long-term relationship and i've been thinking about what i want in the next one.. normal, right? so i want to know how open your relationship is with your partner. do you openly flirt with other people in front of them or online? go on dates with other people? do you not dare to glance in the direction of someone of the preferred sex when your partner is around? do you talk about your crushes? my relationship was so closed off, we didn't have friends of the opposite sex. flirting was made out to be a bad thing and i often felt guilty for being human! i want something more open the next time around but still "monogamous". tl;dr refer to title.	😅

girls: "i want a boy that plays the guitar " this has happened to me so many times. i'll be like "hey i've been playing the guitar for over a decade, i could play probably any song you'd like" and then i just get "nooooo lol" because their version of a boy that plays the guitar is a guy with long hair, muscular, wears beanies, and smokes weed, but can only play smoke on the water. why the fuck is it like this.	🥺

should i [23m] worry about how this conversation went with her [23f]? we were chatting on facebook messenger about work and then i did not reply on her last work related topic. then she changed the topic after 10 mins of her last message sent in which i failed to reply yet. here is the breakdown of the chat message. her: i met friend a haha (friend a is one of my closest friend in which she just met friend a today) her: and then im with friend b a while ago. i just found out that friend b also knows friend a wtf me: is friend a with you when you guys are with friend b? her: nope. im with friend b a while ago. then i just met friend a today. me: why did you meet friend a? her: because he's with my younger sister me: are they dating? (she told me a story before that her younger sister sees with friend a twice already and only both of them) her: idk haha me: where are you and why are you with them? (her younger sister and with friend a) her: at the mall, my boyfriend treats my family me: why is friend a also invited in the family treat? her: no. friend a went out with my younger sister and he accompanied her in the family dinner treat me: my guess is that they are already dating then she left me on read. did i do something wrong? the conversation was fun but i felt like she just ended the conversation. i thought that she will continue to engage on it. should i worry how our interaction went? thoughts? tldr: she ended the conversation when the conversation was fun and engaging. should i worry about it?	😂

when i flipped out i've been working some really long days...about 14 hours on average. this isn't anything new to me, but it's finally catching up with me badly. couple that with the severe back issues i've had for years that i've had several procedure to try to correct that don't work, and i'm just shot at the end of the day. well, i passed out at about 7:15ish last night. my wife woke me up at about 8:30 so i could take nighttime meds and get in bed for the night. well, something didn't register right in my mind when i saw the clock reading 8:34...i honestly thought it was 8:34 in the morning. i usually leave for work around 4:30am, so 8:34am would be ridiculously late. so of course, i fucking panic. the only person in my line of sight was my wife, who was still fully dressed in her work attire from the day, so, like i said, i swore it was 8:34am. i am a grown man, and don't expect the wife to have to wake me up ever, but being in a panic, i lost my shit on her. "why the fuck are you waking me up so late!" would be the nicest thing i said. she's laughing at me at this point, which really pissed me the fuck off. finally, she explains the situation and why she's laughing. man, i felt like a moron. of course i apologized...and now i laugh about it too...but i'm that moment, i was mortified, anxious, and mad. sorry rachael tl;dr fell asleep at 7:15pm, wife woke me up at 8:30pm - thought it was 8:30am and flipped the ever loving fuck out.	😂
i (20f) am conflicted and don't know if i want to be with my (20m) boyfriend anymore... first i should say that we have been together for one year and one month. we also have a 2 month old baby and we live together. when we first started dating everything was perfect. then he moved in with me and i got pregnant(even after taking plan b). we were excited to have a baby but also scared. me and him started arguing like every other day. he gets very defensive when we get into an argument and he yells i mentioned to him that the amount of times we argue is not good. he says "if you don't argue in a relationship then it's fake" (fucking confusing). recent incident happened where he ended up losing my trust and i think that pretty much made me not be in a relationship anymore. arguing almost everyday gets super tiring, especially having depression and anxiety, it is not good on my mental health. he is bipolar and i feel like i am his emotional "punching bag." the way he talks to me is rude and when i let him know, he denies it. but when i have the slightest attitude(even when i was pregnant) all hell broke loose). he punches things, throws things and it makes me nervous. he is a great father though.. he gets frustrated at times but that's normal since she's a newborn. i should add that when we argue, he makes me feel super bad and like i'm a bad gf. having depression i tend to overthink things and i'm really sensitive and he knows that. i've also told him that when he raises his voice at me i get anxiety but nothing has changed. i don't know what to do because we have a kid together and i always told myself i wouldn't bring my kid up in a broken family bc i grew up in one. but i also feel like if i stay in the relationship any longer i can feel myself resent my boyfriend even more every time we argue again. i should also mention that i was in a 4 year relationship where all we did was argue and my ex was very controlling and that didn't end well. i feel like i have mentally checked out. if i leave i know i will feel bad. i always try to see the good in ppl even if i've been disrespected so much and i think it's cause i love him. this post prolly seems all over the place, but i need some advice!!! if you guys need any clarification pls lmk i need as much advice as i can get	😭

i like this guy but i'm not attracted to him hello, i recently met this wonderful guy who just gets me in every way. we can talk all the time even if we are both incredibly awkward. him more so than me. he gets my feelings and ge even drove over an hour to see and have lunch with me. i really like him too and i love how we have the same goals in life and how genuine he is. he even asked ne out and i felt really excited because i can finally have a connection with someone. i'm almost 20 and i've hardly dated anyone. but there is oje problem... i'm not attracted to him in anyway. i feel so shallow and shameful. i keep asking myself why aren't i and how could my my mind be so dumb. he's prefect. my friends know i'm not attracted to him and they mock me for giving him the time of the day. he's not the good looking guy, but he has a heart and i'm trying to figure out how to get over this. i don't want to hurt him because i did accept his offer of dating. i hope i don't sound too shallow or mean. tldr: i'm not attracted to a wonderful guy i'm dating.	😔

i don't know what to do about him hey everyone! tl;dr at the end to the post i'm a 16 year old girl, that has a confused heart... i'm sorry if my english isn't the best. it's not my native language, i'm from the netherlands! if the formating suckes it is because i am on my phone. so i have this best friend, let's call him... mitch? mitch and i basically grew up together. we've been in the same class until the second year of high school (grade 13 or 8 says google?). from grade 8 till 11 we had this thing, puppylove is what i'll call it. it wasn't serious but i really liked him. i was to shy and insecure to show that... when he ended our puppylove, i bawled my eyes out. then when we started on our new school we fell in love again, two times actually. once again i was to shy and insecure to say yes. we used to talk a lot on whatsapp, send each other cute quotes like "i am crazy about you". this was all 4 years ago now. i still really regret it to this day, like really. everyone says that we are like perfect for each other and yes it sounds like really cheesy. what if it is? there has been no boy that i've liked since him.. fast forward to 2018/2019, he has a girlfriend. she is really nice, but has the same freaking name as me... like literally letter for letter the same!! everytime we talk about their relationship he says that he doesn't wat to be with her for like 4 years or something. i understand that, we are young and he likes to drink a bit heheh (legal age minimum is 18 here, but even kids at the age of 13/14 are already drinking alcohol). one time i sent this picture on snapchat with the caption "i wish i could go back in time" he replied. he said "to the time then we had something?", i replied with "yes of course it was way easier back then! less homework, better friends etc.". he then said something along the lines of "and me?"... i really wanted to say yes but i didn't. more thinks like that happend, like him wanting go hit the gym more often and wanting his calvin klein model body. he asked me if i would take him back if he was like that. uhm did you not get the memo? i. like. you. a. lot. i don't want to ruin the friendship we have, but something in me says a part of him still likes me, i might be getting a whole wrong feeling here but i generally do not know. for my birthday he wants to go have lunch together, like the two of us. i am so so nervous and think about him a lot. does anyone have any advice for very confused me? thank you [ tl;dr ] i like my bestfriend, he has a girlfriend with the same name as me and i don't know what to do about it	❤️

1 man. 1 woman and 3 children sometimes it more hurtful when the reality of a relationship is that one of you really wishes that it would work out. my girlfriend has three children and in the beginning of our relationship together, things were rocky as fuck to begin with. things were rocky because, at the beginning of the relationship i was 27, with maybe 2 or three serious previous relationships. "what is a guy like that doing in a relationship like this one?" the closest i've ever been to having a baby was the one time i was afraid because the condom broke mid stroke and i was not sure whether or not i had gotten any of myself inside of the woman. dating a woman who already has three children is by far my biggest challenge yet. and challenging it was. by nature, when i'm a relationship, i am always looking to work things out. by nature, in relationships she would walk out at the first sign of trouble. the concept of anyone ever having any issues related to her children was extremely foreign to her. the concept is extremely new to me so i pretty much spent a lot of time in angst over why she has children and why she is allowing it to affect our relationship...in other words, they would affect the quality of our relationship if the children were constantly in the picture and were offering demands. (i wasn't even able to properly communicate my angst or disapproval in most moments because i felt that bringing children into a new relationship is certainly a no no) anyways, since i had already gotten myself involved, part of me was determined to see it through. in contrast, she only heard"this guy has issues with my children and it's problematic because my children are an extension of me and they go wherever i go." the shortened version of this long story is that when we weren't arguing over issues related to her three children, which would always seem to pop up at anytime, we were laughing and enjoying our time together and that is what i would always fight for. even though most concerns were raised by me, i would also actively be the glue that fought to hold us together. we are currently standing on our last legs and there's no sign of redemption in sight. all that time and effort, wasted. smh. tldr. basically it's about the objective perspective of my romantic relationship this year. i'm focusing on the children because they are the biggest challenges for me. again, never been in anything similar	😢

why would someone ask: why do you like me? hello! i have this friend, we met some weeks ago and i wanted to be honest so i told him i liked him. he then asked me why, so i told him the truth and the things i liked about him. of course i know this is not a "it's something mutual" answer. i'm just curious about why would someone ask a question like this.	😳

i think i have a psychological problem with my skin tone.. (suggestions on what to do?) hi all! i'm not sure where to post this so i guess i'll post it here and hope for some replies so i have an issue.. not sure where to start. i'm mexican. i was born from a family with a very tanned/ dark skin complexion but unlike them.. i was born white as fuck. ever since i was born i could notice that my family/ extended family would envy me for my skin color which ultimately caused me to become the black sheep of the family. i kinda just got hated on by them for something i couldn't control. anyway, my skin tone played a huge part in my upbringing and how i am today due to the experiences attached to it. at first i hated that i was this white since i didn't "belong" but over time i started liking it. fuck my asshole family but.. i started liking it too much. at around 16ish i started seeing myself as darker than i actually was. people would often tell me how pale i was but i saw myself as really dark skinned.. sometimes i'd compare myself to someone who i thought was whiter than me but when i looked at the mirror side by side most of the time i'd be paler.. i'm not sure why but when i look in the mirror i see how things really are but when i look at myself things are like idk it's like what i'm seeing isn't there. for example, when i first started wearing shorts i thought my legs were dark af but when i looked in the mirror i saw (my true skin color) that they were in fact pale.. i think i have a problem.. suggestions?	😐

f(22) moving away due to job loss m(26) says let's call it quits see what happens not even attempting long distance which isn't even long distance of 1hr 15 drive so we've been together since january. things are going pretty well. then i lost my job and i have to move home. he says 1hr is long distance. i personally don't think that it's that bad but he said he'd rather leave things and hopefully be friends or see what happens. what does that mean see what happens , let's try being friends. i personally want to try 'long distance ' but it can't be a one sided thing as it will become sour very fast! i said we shouldn't call any shots until i get another job and see where it is: part of me really wants him to say move in with me. then i can look for jobs back where i was. what should i do tldr i lost my job had to move home. my bf said he doesn't want to try long distance as it falls apart and wants to see what happens ... but i just want him to try i guess.	😢
does anyone else find the emoji a little annoying? i think it is overused and definitely used exaggeratedly.	😂
my friend says pokemon isn't an anime lol he said i should *never ever* classify pokemon as an anime, he said i'm very uncultured on anime looool. he also asked what's my favorite anime manga, i said pokemon lol. that made him go crazy today he told me, he has faith in me on watching one punch man, idk if i can live up to his expectations lmao i haven't really been watching, playing pokemin since 3 years , so idk tbh if ill like one punch man, but i guess i'll try	😔
my dog cheered me up after a rough week :) i've been feeling really sad and anxious lately. but i finally went out of my room today. and my dog, boo, immediately came to my side. he kept booping his snoot to my leg while i had my lunch, which he usually does cause he wants some food. but after all that, i went to sit down to pet him and he immediately laid his head near my knees, then kept looking up at me periodically like he didn't want me to leave. and idk, i just really appreciated it. :) i felt like boo knew that i've been sad and i felt like he was cheering me up. that's all. i hope you all have a good day and i'd love to hear some pet stories if you have any~	😅
listening someone singing in the distance and trying to reply with my piano... i guess i creeped her out. tl;dr: i was doing homework and listened someone singing viva la vida and playing the ukulele! i was so pleased that i played the song on the piano... she stopped singing and i feel really, really, really bad... haha.. viva la vida i guess... i live in an apartment building. i don't know if the title explains it well but, about ten minutes ago, i was just finishing an assignment i have due tomorrow, and then i suddenly heard someone singing coldplay's viva la vida with an amazingly cute voice, and i could hear an ukelele too. i was falling in love... i mean, a girl singing my favorite song, and by the sound she must live near me... "i hear jerusalem bells are ringing, roman calvary choirs are singing, nananana..." and then "for some reason i can't explain, i know st peter won't call my name..." i always get chills with this part, it's so deep. i wasn't really planning anything or trying to hit on her, i mean, why?, it was just a very pleasant surprise. i was too tired at the moment so i didn't think well, and it turns out, i play some piano and i knew this song, kind of. so i turned it on and started playing it. "hear jerusal..." i played it like 3 minutes. but she stopped singing then. i started feeling anxious, maybe i creepped her out... i wouldn't feel that way if i was her, i would be very pleased and surprised, that's why i did it. anyways, please forgive me, stranger. well, i guess, viva la vida!!!	😁
do you want a friend to talk to? step right up because i 100% would love to talk to all of you lovly peeps. feel free to dm me	😊
hi. do you guys know how to apologize to someone that you haven't talked to for approximately a year? i'm 20(f). english is not my native language, so i hope everyone could bear with my writing. thank you when i was 19, i moved to another country for college. to an asian girl from a fairly conservative country like me, leaving my family for the first time was utterly insane. at the same time, i was struggling with studying and a very unstable boyfriend with bipolar disorder and major depression. after months of trying, we finally broke up and although i understood that it was time to call it quits, it still wasn't an amicable, easy goodbye - we were best friend for years and he was truly wonderful. feeling too heart-broken, i drank my ass off in my best guy friend's room. let's just take a second to talk about my friend. he was (still is) one of the nicest guys ever. he was always willing to help everyone out. he offered to buy candies for people who failed their exams. he spent his whole afternoon trying to find a lost kid's parents. he looked after me whenever i was sick although i never asked him to do so. i still remember this one time when he woke up at 4 to carry my suitcase all the way up a mountain under a huge snowstorm (our university, although pretty prestigious, is located in a super rural area. the nearest bus stop is located on the mountain). i was too cold to even move my body while waiting for the bus, so he fixed my shoelaces for me. god, how could i still remember that? i was so drunk so i just kinda collapsed on his bed constantly talking shits about how everyone left everyone and he just smiled while patting my head. "thatlamepumpkin, i'm here. i'm not gonna leave." after a lot of crying from me and one very vague confession from him, we ended up sleeping with each other. i was drunk and he didn't drink. the problem? he was already in a very committed, 6-year long relationship. after that, we just couldn't face each other anymore and it didn't take long for everyone to notice how the atmosphere between us had changed drastically. they started to talk behind my back, like how i seduced him and ruined his perfect relationship (his girlfriend is a controlling psychopath - his close friends all knew it but people didn't). i got mad because he didn't try to defend me so after that, whenever anyone asked what happened between us, i vaguely implied that 'something' happened. we stopped talking since then. full on stop, like blocking each other on every social media stop. now it has been almost a year, i still miss him everyday - he is always the first thing i think of every morning - and i understand that the only i could win him back is to apologize sincerely for smearing shits all over his good guy reputation. do you guys think i should apologize? if i should, then how should i start?	❤️
so yeah... i'm a gamer	😎
making airport security think i had a bomb in my carry on luggage classic "wasn't today" disclaimer, but just remembered this and thought i'd share as some might find this amusing. went to the us for a holiday last summer for 3 weeks and decided we would try and do some exercise while we were there. suitcases were full of the items for later in the journey so hand luggage was the quick access things - camera / laptop / some books etc and just chucked some gym kit in with it. clothes, trainers, floss bands etc and skipping rope. got to the airport, checked in, reached security and put the bag on the tray. walked through scanner etc thinking nothing of it. next thing i know my bag has gone down the manual check lane and 3 people have made their way towards it. i could see them looking at the monitor and discussing it, before one of them fairly aggressively asked me if this was my bag and started interrogating me - where i was from, where i was going, how long, what for etc then asked what i had in the bag. at this point he brings me round to the monitor and all i can say is the image on the screen with the heat maps made my untangled skipping rope next to something else in the bag look like a damn bomb with wires coming out!! safe to say once i'd opened the bag and proved the contents we had a bit of a laugh about it and moved on, but for a minute they must have been pretty concerned tldr, took a skipping rope in my carry on bag and the way it had untangled looked like wires coming from a bomb on the scanner	😂
hey guys whats crackalackin life is weird and fucked up rn but i love you guys talk to me you crazy kittens	🥺
struggling to answer "what makes you unique?" this seems ridiculous but i've spent the past 20 minutes trying to find the answer to my journal prompt for the day! you'd think that for a 30year old young lady, i'd have an answer but wow! i'm drawing blanks!! a part of me thinks i'm trying to come up with the "perfect" answer because i'm kind of a perfectionist. oh well, i guess i have my day's food for thought! over to you. "what makes you unique?"	🤔

long (23/01/18) from hand written on "norman lewis":: finally getting over depression the reason of depression wasn't ourside world but it was actually all inside my head but it got triggered by external favtors when i saw my own pic of 2014/2015 in my dad phone. i realized i am niw 1000x better, writing things or stuffs seems awkward like, what will happen if someone would read it, so i would ratger write diary online but my ohone is broken at the moment, so.... "worrying is like carrying an umbrella and waiting for rain to happen" i am jn bare** right now and feeling bored so decided to write.... something to write ranveer singg is the most energetic and awesome actor in bollywood. cristinano ronaldo is the greatest & dopest footballer in the world. ranveer & ronaldo are my role models it's the first time, i am writing down anything instead of writing it online but writing is the coolest thing in the world writing is the best remedy for worry, it calms you down and relieve stress, writing feels extremely uncomfortable on a norman lewis book of vocabulary which anyone could read fuck off, if you arr reading this but ranveer singh won't feel uncomfortable writing down anything. he js so bold that once he told to a news reporter that he losts his virginity at age 13. so i don't give a fuck if someone would read this like i never got offended or triggered to anything at all. my resolution of 2018 is to bulk up writing is the best thing in the world it helps in keeping yourself calm so now everything is clear for me (i think so, fortunately) * worry * if you can do something-then do it- then why worry * if you can't do anything- thwn why worry so now my head seems empty now :) enough writing for today, now i am gonna read this book content of vocabulary but i will try my best rk write diary daily	😎
*sighs* *unzips pants* aw shit, here we go again. 0.5mm, take it or leave it filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler	😤
i am bored nothing i do interests me. i have not felt anything but meh for like a year now and i am tired of it but i don't know how to change it. anyone else in the same situation?	😐
i (25m) have been with my girlfriend/mother of my child (24f) for 2 years now but she is extremely negative and i dont know what to do anymore and need advice. so i have been with my girlfriend now for over 2 years and in this time have also had a beautiful girl who we both absolutely adore. recently however i feel completely trapped in a very strange relationship and i dont know what to do. when i first got with my girlfriend she had attitude behind her but it was never towards me. she would (and still does) get agitated by anything, if someone said something or done something very minute she didnt like she would have to let the whole world know how shes annoyed off because of it. even tiny things like watching the tv and the remote falls to the floor it would be a massive deal where she would let out a massive sigh and would stomp around when picking it up, again, letting the world know she is annoyed. i'm a quite a chill guy, i always try and think positive and the majority of people who get to know me seem to be the same when they're around me which is cool. because of this i thought she might be the same and for a long time she was but then it changed. these little annoyances would also be aimed towards me eventually and when i would bring it up with her she would deny it when it clearly was. going to places with her is an absolute chore at times. we go shopping and a shop hasn't got the item she wanted? she will have a attitude on her for the majority of the day. people walking slow in front of her, majorly annoyed like someone's just attacked her or something. visiting places and sight seeing she isnt interested and has to make a point how it's all boring and pointless to her. she doesnt have many friends and tbh i can see why. a lot of them stopped talking to her, they never explained why but the reason is obvious. i have quite a lot of friends and due to past experiences i never bring her to anything anymore that includes them. i have been on nights out with her where she has spoken to friends, some best friends, like absolute garbage for no reason whatsoever. they haven't done anything wrong, chill like myself and they dont know what to say back so awkwardly play it off with humour. i get made to feel guilty now when i go out with friends because shes not included and doesnt get to do these things herself so its "not fair". we have a beautiful 9 month baby who absolutely adores me and i her. my girlfriend for the most part is great with her and does a lot for her but then will sometimes speak to the baby like an adult. if the baby doesnt want to go to sleep my gf will get very angry with her and swear etc. if i chime in and tell her to calm down/stop swearing i get a ear load of abuse back and are made out that i havnt got a say in it because i'm not the one getting her to sleep/feeding/changing her at that time etc.. it's very weird. theres been time and time again where i have nearly walked and everytime she has begged me to come back and i have after a few hours. her father was and is in the army so at a young age (about 8) her and her younger brother where sent to a boarding school and she hated it. she was there till she was 16 which then she lived with her auntie, uncle nd two cousins. her attitude was bad there as eventually her auntie made her dad tell her she needs to move out and find a flat which her dad would pay for. her mum and dad are nice and they separated recently, both living with other partners who both have teen children or children turning into teens. i think this makes it worse as she never got that same experience with her mum and dad which is why shes so hateful. i've offered countless support, and i get it thrown back in my face everytime. she says she will changed but never does. my family are starting to realise this as shes even been the same around them so the house we live in feels so dark and miserable all the time as we all feel as though we are treading on egg shells. every day i fake happiness with her for the sake of the baby. i'm scared that if we split she will be twice as bad with the baby and then the baby will grow up with the same attitude etc. i also really like her family, her cousins are amazing and her brother is a great lad, because of them i've met new friends and as you can guess she didnt, i just dont know what happend down the line with her for her to be like this or maybe her natural personality. i just cant do this anymore, its eating at me every day. we share no common interests at all, i'm really into sport and all things nerdy. i could sit at home watching any type of film and she wont enjoy it, i would happily go out for drinks or visit places she wouldn't want to do that, there would be and has been a massive moan. dont get me wrong we do have a laugh sometimes, but it's nothing major. if we didn't have a child i would be gone, statistically children do better when parents arnt separated but honestly i think it would be worse for the little one uf we did stay together as i dont think the arguing will ever end. i used to keep quiet but i dont anymore, and i'm past caring for my gf. i dont love her romantically anymore, just love her in a wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her way. any thoughts or advice on what you think i could do? should i keep trying or part ways? sorry for the huge amount of info. there would be more in all honesty but trying to not go too mental . thanks. tl;dr: i (25m) have been with my girlfriend/mother of my child (24f) for 2 years now but she is extremely negative and i dont know what to do anymore and need advice.	😂

just had the worst dream of my life. hows your morning going? it's too early in the morning to talk to anyone so i figured i'd post this any dream insights or distractions for me?	😅
i had my first kiss with someone who hates me. we are both female and we were 12. lets call her a. she had been distant toward me for a few months before this event, which was in swimming class st school. she had stopped attending choir lessions, telling me that she is no good, and wants to draw instead. we used to hang out nearly every single day, and had a whole fantasy playworld. we held hands and i suppose we were the types to lay in the grass together too. i never thought of kissing her. however, to me she were the most amazing, talented and prettiest person alive. i was into boys at 11, and i hit puberty pretty hard, alone. none of the other girls were quite there yet. i'm highly functional autistic(aspergers) and didn't know at the time. i moved to the country from the city. (a) was my classmate and we clicked within minutes. our main teacher was also a freelance choir teacher, and we would be her favorites before and after school. we had this teacher for only a couple of years. i have long blonde hair, and have always liked ti wear dresses quite feminine but practical. i was very innocent and naive, and my parents beleived in being the better person. never standing up for yourself, but instead explain. and accept that they who wish to harm you probably have it worse in life than you. we're not religious. when at school i would wear french romantic dresses my grandparents bought me. i'm very beloved and protected by them. they still see me as a child, and are stuck in that time-saying it was their best years when me and my sis were children. at school i was told frequently "we don't wear clothes like that here". i didn't really care. i told them that's their opinion, but personally i liked it. all of a sudden, (a) belonged to the popular girls, and they would start to subtly poke at my confidence. i was pretty confident. noone could make me cry etc at the time. i was slim but got pretty obvious curves, and that was not "in" back then. the days of the miss sixty trousers. it got worse. (a) asked me playfully to keep a secret and duck under water with her, and she gave me a long normal kiss. i broke the secret by thinking it was a prank, and was told i was lying. after the kiss she slowly became cold toward me. i'm thinking it may not have been a prank? she would "never be at home" anymore or "feel poorly" and sent her mom to lie to me at the door. meeting her outside with my bike was our normal hangout. i gave up after 3 weeks. the girls would stop inviting me to things, and one day my birthday came, and noone showed. i didn't invite the while class, but it destroyed me. i had prepared cakes and activites with my mom. i didn't confront them about it, but would instead be their awkward pet. i used these years to build social skills by testing out social bounderies and social rules. i needs to understand the patterns. other kids would bore me, so i never befriended anyone. i didnt't think of this as a strategy, but it definatly did more harm than good. the only life i had was the creative after school and lots of family time which was enough to keep me kinda sane, or so i thought. i got a tiny bit chubby, which finally gave one of the now clearly bullies (l) of the girl group to have something to really comment at. i've battled bulimia because this, bit have won over it. and the memory of (l's) smug face makes my blond boil. l was even chubby herself. the whole class of 199*- would now turn on me. i've been beaten and spat on by the boys. to this day, i don't understand why. i hit back once, but got scared of how strong i was. i wanted to escape the country. tante as now my goal. i spent the nest two schools pretty much alone. some would call themselfes my firends, but i felt numb and no connection, and developed anxiety. my talent got kinda wasted. i lost the confidence i needed. in high school (a) would compliment me after singing/guitar perforences. and at graduation (a) figured, although we never ever talked that i would move back to the city. she was right. she gave a very, very long and tight hug. i was confused. ironically we now live in the same city. she moved here a few years after me, and i'm terrified of bumping into her. i'm not very good at hate, and i dont't hate her. i'm an adult now, but all of this still haunts me to this day. i'm working on myself, and am much stronger with a good life and social circle. i still struggle with trust, and the part about people liking me or not is now forever lost. so i connect being invited as being accepted. after failed birthdays in childhood and teens (yes, i tried again. thanks, mom.), i've never dared to host one today. i still obsurdely feel that noone would show up. i haven't proof-read as this is painful stuff, so i hope it's understandable. english isn't my first language. it might be a big ol' mess. i'm open to explaining in the comments. thank you if you read all this! none of my friends can work this one out. why did a ditch me, and why did she initiate that kiss? i have no idea what all of it all means. maybe someone has an opinion or a similar experience?	❤️
making a christmas decoration in chemistry happened right now, literally turned on my phone right after to type this. so some background info: i'm in high school and taking chemistry. my teacher who is a nice,young but kind of sensitive women decided you know what since christmas is coming up let's make some decorations for christmas using some metal which is the size of a small rectangle maybe 4 inches tall and 3 wide, which we were then gonna cover tape all over it, draw on it, take a blade and cut the drawing leaving behind a silhouette of the drawing and finally dipping it in some acid to to make it look cooler. now everyone was thinking "oh i'm gonna draw a christmas tree" or "i'm gonna draw smiley face", but not me. i wanted to be that one motherfucker who wanted to be funny and make something different. so i whipped out my phone like i whip out my dick for harambe, searched a funny drawing, and started drawing nermal the cat who is giving the middle finger, which literally cracks me up everytime i see it. in my opinion it looks pretty good. so i finish drawing and cutting it and then take it over to where we dip it in acid. it looks glorious. class is almost over so she says to put all the finished decorations in this little box which i do and then head off to my next/finaly class. half an hour before my last class finishes, this announcement comes up and through the whole school "which ever teacher has "me" send him to the main office now". here i am freaking the fuck out, which im wondering what the fuck did i do, which makes me freak out even more. i head to the office feeling like a badass, everyone is looking at me like "oh shit that motherfucker looks like he eats nails for breakfast". little do they know i'm fucking shitting bricks. when i get there i see my last period teacher with tears, the fucking principal comes at me pulling up my drawing <url> and says "abadplayervg this drawing is absolutely not acceptable, you can not possibly have thought this was appropriate, look what you have done to 'mrs.teacher'....we have no choice but to give you iss (in school suspension). i'm here still shitting bricks and said to him " i am so sorry, i didn't think this drawing would hurt anyone. it's just a cat giving a finger, i didn't know it would offend anyone. my teacher then says "ohhhhhhhhhhh, you think this is a game?! you think this drawing that represents women being used only for sex is nothing serious?!" right then and there i was like hold up and said "what are you talking about? this drawing doesn't mean anything, it's literally what it is. a cat creepishly smiling and flipping the bird. we got all this set straight after that and found out my teacher pulled a fucking dwight schrute. apparently she thought that since a cat is referred to as pussy she associated it with a vagina and since it was giving the middle finger she associated it as "fucking a pussy" the cats smile must've represented to her as a creepy male smile so if you put it together she ultimately thought "men can fuck women as much as they want and whenever they want" she literally when "oh,haha sorry i guess i overreacted a bit". my principal literally gave off this face <url> i went back to class and told everyone the story i'm telling you right now. guess this is where my comedic advances come to end so thats it. happy holidays tl;dr. made a christmas decoration in chemistry, that had a cat giving a middle finger, sensitive teacher overreacted, she though it meant "women are only used for sex", got sent to office where it was straightened out edit: a picture after it was dipped in acid <url>	😅
i just want to cuddle is that too much to ask for?	😔
i'm hydrophobic das cool	😎

so my friend unexpectedly got pregnant... being a virgin ain't bad	😎
saw the cutest guy ever when to harrods this saturday before midday (low-key hinting at anyone who knows a friend that works there at that time haha) and one of the staff there was absolutely beautiful. not going to lie--i lingered a bit on the floor he was on to get a look. isn't it so funny how we see people we find attractive but will never see them again? and they'll never know we had a fleeting thought about them? life tell me about the cute people you saw today or any day matter of fact.	😏
thoughts on our new era i've just realized that it's truly a new era when the husband from reba is the bdsm loving neighbor in shameless... not sure why it took this instead of trump to convince me (i'm kidding, don't worry) i actually don't have much else to say. i just thought it was odd to see an actor in a pg family christian show play such an antithetical character. the end	🤔
well boys, i did it. i was just at our 9th grade party. it's like a goodbye party now that we are splitting up into all life's directions. a girl i am friends with and i really liked actually liked me back. me, a kinda overweight guy that are bad at social interactions. there was an hour left of the party and while dancing to a nice song i leaned in for a kiss...and she kissed back. sorry for any wierd grammatical or sentence errors. it's 1:47 and i am going to die now. later virgins	😎
drunk husband... my husband had a little too much to drink. he was throwing up and acting dumb. i guess he finally got it all out...literally. i hope this doesn't happen again. i'm just glad it doesn't happen often.	🙄
epic gamer prank raid r/feemagers with pp pics	😎
got a complement background: i've been growing my hair out since quarintine. people at school have told me that they didnt reconigize me the first time they saw me. so my hair is parted in the middle going down to the sides and flows down. the girl that sits infront of me complemented my hair today. and that made me happy :)	😁
yoooo bet so this girl said she used to like me and stopped liking me when i sort of rejected her, so then she said that she didn't like me anymore once a while after she was told that, and so i told her that i kind of liked her around that same time period but didn't realize that i liked her because i liked someone else, and sort of stopped liking her around the time she told me she didn't like me, but plot twist she was lying to me and turns out she still does and i basically exposed myself on the spot and now i don't know what to do	😎
when your post on r/all gets locked because too many people were racists towards me	😎
"new chat" from crush on kik: help!! i need someone to help me with kik. yesterday morning, i added a new contact/phone number to my phone (someone i have a crush on). then i was using kik throughout the day. around dinnertime, i went on kik again and there was a "new chat" message at the top of my list from the crush guy in question. what i don't know is this: was this "new chat" generated by kik based on the app re-scanning my phone address book and matching up crush guy's phone number? did crush guy actually search my number and send this himself? did kik send some kind of notification to crush guy that he clicked on to make me get this "new chat?" i'm assuming it was generated by the app, but i just want to be sure it isn't real. i can't post a pic, but...it came in several hours after i added the contact, it has crush guy's picture and username, and says "your phone contact ***** is on kik." ignore/chat. there's no message bubble. i know this is a dumb question, but if anyone knows the answer, i'd be so grateful. thanks.	❤️
this is a horny post cock that's literally it	😳
i have a miserable cold and my voice sounds like i'm a teenage boy going through puberty. cold meds aren't making a dent. i had three shots of vodka earlier at an office happy hour that helped numb the throat a bit, or i was buzzed and didn't care about being sick, dunno what are some of your tested & approved cold remedies? i'm ready to swallow literal fire right now! tl;dr - cough cough sniffle sneeze	😂
being gay sucks "no pun intended" i'm a sophomore now and i go to a school in nebraska that's fairly small and full of bigoted people, and even though i'm out as gay i'm scared to dress the way i'd like or act the way i'd like because people here are very judgmental, and because of where i live and the circumstances i also feel very lonely, and like i'm not going to find a boyfriend who i can share intimacy with. since i've moved out here i haven't had that feeling and i'm really close to just ending it. i miss my boyfriend but i had to leave him due to moving and i don't know what to do. i've never been this depressed and i'm so close to just ending it so i need to make it clear that i love you all	❤️
reddit is the best. period reddit has always been with me whenever i need. when i'm happy i share stuffs with you guys when i am sad ya'll console me. no one has ever cared/done so much for me. thank you reddit my life has changed after reddit. thank you r/teenagers too.	❤️

i'm almost 31 years old and i'm finally going to get my first credit card today. yup. you read that right. never had a credit card or really needed one till today. i applied for a auto loan and my bank told me i have no credit. despite me having 3 auto loans in the past. their reasoning was since my last loan was over 3 years ago and more or less "fell off the books". my loan got approved. but at 16% interest . so of course i turned that down. i'm not sure how any of this stuff works. so any advice is welcome.	😁

my (34/m) best friend of 4 years (29/f) has chosen to end our friendship i'm devastated. i met this friend 4 years ago while traveling to texas and we had a lot in common right off the bat, and coincidentally live with a mile away in l.a. when i first met her, our relationship was briefly sexual, but shortly after that, it became purely platonic. i know that can complicate things, but it's never been awkward keeping the friendship alive, as i knew there was no longer interest in me from a sexual perspective. so boundaries have always been clear and i've never made any passes since those first few times we met, etc. over the course of a year, my friend's mental health has deteriorated. she's bi-polar and has borderline personality disorder, plus addiction issues, but i feel like i've been a supportive friend in that regard. currently, she's in an iop and residential housing. she confided in me every single issue she's been facing, as i'm pretty pragmatic with advice. last sunday, we had plans to go to a boxing class, but right before the class, she sends me a lengthy text explaining to me that she has been upset with me for weeks cause i told a mutual friend of hers that she was in treatment, when the friend inquired with me directly. i didn't want to lie to her friend, but she felt that her trust was violated. i apologized and admitted i shouldn't have disclosed that info, but she continued to attack me on some other claim that "i always want to date her friends", which is kinda unfounded. full disclosure, she tried dating one of the guy's at her treatment center, which is way worse, ha. anyways, a lot of personal attacks via text. fast forward to last friday, she sends a text to apologize how she worded her texts (not an outright apology for accusing me of violating trust, etc.) to her text, i replied that i felt personally attacked and made a remark that her apology coincided with the exact day i met her 4 years ago and i'm trying my best to move on. in retrospect, i should have accepted her apology a bit better, but my anger got the best of me. she questions what i meant by "move on". i explained *"drop it. larger fish to fry."* last night, i decided i had enough torment about this falling out and sent a couple sincere texts apologizing for everything. i closed with the following: *"i miss you and i wanna see this patched up. i know you are going through a lot. you are a really special friend to me and mean a lot. i love you."* she possibly interpreted this text as if i was proclaiming that i had romantic feelings for her and that my previous text remarking about the day we met was creepy. she says she only sees me as a friend and that she can't be friends anymore because i have romantic feelings for her. i replied explaining that i've also only seen our friendship as purely platonic, but she countered that even if that were true, she now feels uncomfortable being friends anymore and to not message her anymore. i replied, i respect that and wished her good luck. end. i feel so depressed. we have texted each other everyday these past couple of years and she's been my closest friend. it feels like a bad break-up, but i've honestly never had a really long-term relationship, so i'm guessing this is what it's kinda like. she's made me feel really guilty about ever having feelings, friendly or otherwise. i'm going through a lot of changes right now and i'm sad to not have a close friend anymore. i have a pristine record of never having friendships fall-out on bad terms, until now. **tldr:** my friend and i had an argument over text. we both miscommunicated our feelings amidst some difficult environmental and social factors, but now the friendship is beyond repair.	❤️
watching twomad's yt videos makes me extremely anxious but i just can't stop watching his vids	😳
creepy summer school teacher? hey guys i'm a 16 y/o girl and a junior in highschool, because i needed to work on my credits i got enrolled into summer school, so right now i'm sitting in summer school my stomach hurts and is grumbly, and it doesn't help that the teacher is eating cereal and is sitting close to me. he's really creepy too, he gives me bad vibes. the other day i finished a class, and went up to him to get credit for the class. and he looked at me and said in a weird tone "have you thought about coming to mountain high next year" and i was like "nah" and he was like "you should, you might like it " idk it's just really weird to me and wanted to share it	😏

i hate you more than words can ever imagine i hate you and there are not enough words to describe how much. youve made me alienated from society as people have outcasted me and ruined my life even though you should be outcasted. you smell worse than anyone or anything i have ever met. im talking to the onion. when i was a boy my father would make me sit at the kitchen table until i finished all my onions. i would not eat them and i would sit at the table for hours while it got cold and dark and i would be tired but still i would not give in and my dad would yell and scream at me but no i would still not eat thise onions!!! he would then put me in the shed for the night as my brothers who ate onions got to play video games and watch movies but at least in the shed i knew i was safe a while until the next time onions would be served. as i finally got older and would be invited to partys i would again be outcasted as i would ask for pizza not to have onions at pizza party or onionless pork fried rice at a chinese food party but i would be looked at as a weirdo and people would just tell me to deal with it and pick the onions out. not knowing that even seeing onions makes me gag and touching them or smelling them is a sure way to vomit. this sick "vegetable" that seems so minor to some somehow began appearing everywhere in my life. i could not even go out or socialize anymore. green onions, vidalia onions, bermuda onions, i couldnt go anywhere without seeing onions. the guys want to meet up for fajitas and ritas? sorry cant make it. at a point in time it became to the fact where i am 30 years old and live a lone and i dont go outside. at the very low point when i was 27 at a party someone handed me a shot and it was one of those new hipster vodkas and to my dismay it was onion flavored. after vomiting for 5 hours straight i decided that night that i was was not going to have a social life anymore. i sat alone and talked to noone, miserable. one day after a few years i discovered /r/onionhate - a community that understood me- people just like me i did not even know they existed. i felt complete again. a wholesome reddit of people who had grown up tortured and discriminated against for no reason because of one vile "vegetable" . i made friends and swapped experiences and laughed at memes as we discussed all the ways we could destroy onions and onion flavored products. there were even talks among some of the guys and having meet up where we all get together once a year and pile onions into a giant pile (wearing layers of ppe and of course gas masks and gloves) and make a bonfire. i finally had found what had been missing in my life all these years. i had a posse, no, a family of people who thought just like me. things were great. then, the unthinkable happened. i was at the public library, researching ways to create onion poison so they would no longer grow in the earth, when i recieved a phone call that my little nephew was about to be fed an italian sub that had onions on it. i rushed out of the library just in time to knock the sub out if his hands, however in my haste i forgot to log out of the computer. someoje must have seen i was logged into /r/onionhate and trying to be funny they made a comment on a picture of a cheeseburger saying onions were good sometimes on it. i did not know until i logged into reddit that night and saw my messages. the damage had been done and my life was ruined due to onions again. i messaged the moderators but they dont believe today i am here to apologize to /r/onionhate . thanks for giving me a place to belong for a time when no one else would. i also hope to spread onion hate awareness with this post and if anyone would like to donate or join in the fight against onions send me a pm and ill tell you how sorry and thanks	😢
f.r.i.e.n.d.s wouldn't have been so popular if janice's laughter was its laugh track just imagine having [her laughs](<url>) as laugh track for the entire show. would it still have been so popular? or would it even have lasted for a season? extending the conversation, would her laugh have fit as laugh track of any show for that matter? *p.s: i'm talking about the character's laugh alone, has nothing to do with the actress. just random thoughts.*	🤔
how do i get over a guy i never actually dated? (f25 m30) hi everyone! so.. to make a very long story semi-short, here's the deal. 5 years ago i came out of a toxic relationship. was on antidepressants and sleepmedication. after the relationship i unfortunately experienced derealization and depersonalisation. i quit the meds, and 3 years later i came back to 'normal'. last year i started dating again. the dude was bad though so it ended. i rekindled 4 months after with an old friend, whom i actually started talking to right after my ex. turns out he was in a toxic relationship that just ended, too. so.. we talked for hours. every day. he was the one calling me and it could be 5-6 hours everyday. i was aware of the fact that he was going through a rough time, so i only saw him as a friend. after 4 months of just that, and not a meeting in site, i started overthinking the whole thing. i realized that, maybe i did like him. he caught on to that and basically ghosted me. he still writes a short message here and there, but no contact for weeks in private, only publicly on social media. i'm not an insecure person -- neither am i pushy, dramatic etc. i did tell him my feelings that i felt a little discarded, because he started ghosting me when he got better. (like i was therapist-zoned lol) he even said he disliked talking on the phone. which was weird to me, since he was the one calling me all the time and he did because he hated texting. i feel a little used and i just want to move on. i have no idea why i'm holding on. or well, i do. i see a side of him i don't even think he sees himself. i'm not jealous, i give him space, i'm uplifting and i never lovebombed him in any way. we were very friendly. maybe i was too friendly ? the relation we had is basically a relation he created -- because i didn't want to force anything he wasn't ready for. but i'm still clueless to the sudden change (which seems to happen with all the guys i date...) he never mistreated me. he's always super supportive and we basically speak the same language. he has thanked me many times for how much i have helped him and i have done the same. i've been on a selfloving journey for 5 years and i'm truly happy. i have so much love to give that i'm overflowing lol. so... how do i get over this guy? thanks tl;dr - i talked with a guy for 5 months, only as friends. after 4 months i realized i had more than friendly feelings and got ghosted. how do i get over him?	❤️

dman i didnt expect girls to be so hard to come by ngl i thought i would have a girlfriend by now but i didn't know that just finding a girl would be the hard part.	😔
am i [18f] being overly jealous and acting crazy? hey everyone. i've been dating this guy (also 18) for around 8 months now and we started officially dating yesterday. we've had some rough times but we talked and things got better. however at the start of this year i checked his instagram dms because i had seen that he was talking with his ex girlfriend and i thought i saw a weird message on his notification center from her. he was calling her pretty and hot, sending her heart and fire emojis and stuff and also told her "let's get back together? " so when i found those messages i was honestly devastated and i just started crying. we were at his grandma's house with a bunch of his family so i tried to not make a scene. i'm not sure if they noticed but he did later. when i talked with him about it he told me he was just joking and so was she. he said he didn't see anything wrong with it since he wasn't being serious. he called me crazy but later apologized and said he was sorry and that he wouldn't do it again. i was still very hurt because i had told him before about the nightmares i had about him talking with girls like that but he said he didn't remember and he didn't think it would bother me. i decided to forgive me because i though it could have been an honest mistake. we talked about it again later and he said he would block her but he didn't and liked a picture of her in a dressing room with a bathibg suit on. i talked to him about it and he said i was acting crazy checking her profile and that he thought he had blocked her but for some reason it didn't work. i let it go. some time later i asked him if he talked with any other girk like that and he said he didn't, but also told me to stop bringing the topic up because he had already said he was sorry and wouldn't do it again. i said okay. yesterday i checked his facebook messages because i didn't fully believe him. i know it was wrong but curiosity got me. i found a lot of chats with girls but only opened the ones with his ex and one with another girl. these were from around the 10th of december. the messages with the girl were similar to the ones he had with his ex on instagram, and he sent her a picture of him sitting in the toilet seat..? so i guess they were really just joking but it still bothered me, especially since he said he didn't talk with any other girl like that. i haven't told him anything about this yet. now, just a few hours ago he told me he would be going out to smoke weed a girl friend of his. i asked which friend since i know some of them and have no problem with them at all. he said he met her through instagram and they've been talking for a while. i replied "ohh" and that was it. he's probably with her right now. so... what's going on here? am i acting like a "crazy girlfriend" and being way too possessive and jealous? should i even be feeling so uncomfortable right now? i don't know what to think or do. please, please help me here, i have to work with him tomorrow the whole day and i'm just feeling really bad rn. any help is very appreciated! tl;dr: my bf was talking to his ex in a flirty way (imo) and i found out. he apologized and said he wouldn't do it again and also said that she was the only one he talked with like that, which wasn't true. now he's going out for a blunt with a girl friend he met through instagram. am i too jealous?	❤️

i feels resentful of my friends (all 25f) for wanting to hang out with me i am really struggling with two of my friends, even though i know i shouldn't be. i have never been in a relationship (having only casually dated/fwb) and i work part time, so i've always been decently available to hang out with friends and to keep up with their lives via texting and to be the "organiser" of group events. my best friend referred to me as "the queen of emotional labour" . for the most part, i don't mind this role because i do lead a less stressful life. recently, two of my friends have stepped up and tried to be more present and organise more things. one friend (anna) has always intensely focused on her relationship and career and study and i generally go months and months without seeing her, which has been happening literally for the last ten years. i've accepted that we don't have a deep relationship and that's she's very fun to hang out with when i do see her. recently, anna has tried a lot harder to see friends and always tells us how we are her true friends (since she hates people at work and is no longer in contact with people from college). my other friend (summer) has recently come out of a long term relationship and now tries to organise weekly hang outs. i also went months and months without seeing her for about three years because she always chose to put her boyfriend and his friends first. i think it's worth mentioning that after their breakup summer completely freaked out, needed bounds and bounds of emotional support for like 8 months and honestly went months without asking me a single question about myself. i know i sound awful but i'm still really angry about that, i've never experienced a friend just constantly talking their problems at you to that extent. how do i let my grudge go? i feel like anna came crawling back when she lost her college friendships and didn't make any work friends. and i feel like summer came crawling back when she lost her boyfriend. i feel annoyed and resentful when they want to spend time together or deepen the friendship because they didn't care previously for literal years. i know this is illogical because now they are doing the exact behaviour that i always wanted from them. tl;dr friends who ditched me for years now want to spend time together and deepen the friendship and i kind of hate it but really want to stop feeling this way	😂
another 9-5 day, i'm bored talk to me dreams literally get me through life, i have a new plan on how to be happy and fun everyday. seriously though, my best friends laugh at me because some are ridiculous. what helps you get through the day? i'm not even fat nor ugly, just lonely	😂
my(22) boyfriend (23) of 7 years seems uncomfortable with the thought of one day settling down with me, should i act on it? my boyfriend \[23\] and i \[22\] have been dating for 7 years. the past 3 years i have really been thinking about weather or not we have a future together. i love him and he me but... i always have the feeling that he does not feel like i am the one he will end up with. once he would always say "when i get married" "when i have kids", until i told him it made me sad because it kind of made me feel like our relationship was temporary, or that i was not the one he imagined getting married with, or having kids with. i love living in the moment, and i am not in a hurry for us to move in or get married. but the more i get this feeling, the more i feel like i need to be with someone who does not get uncomfortable by the thought of settling down together. he does not say that he does not want to, but he will always avoid subjects regarding us moving in together etc. and in general plans for the future. the past year i have found myself imaging myself with other people, and thinking about what type of guy i would date if i was not in a relationship, but at the same time i want to be with my current boyfriend. i hope you will share your thoughts tl;dr my boyfriend seems not to feel comfortable with the thought of one day committing to me, should i act on it?	❤️

i don't think i'm gonna have an anxiety attack tonight!! yeeeeeees finally! well i'm 100% not gonna speak to soon but i don't think i'm gonna have one! 2 nights in a row with 1 day break and 2 others. i have doubled up on my anxiety meds, i know that = bad but i feel calm, like really calm actually. not that often with adhd also i feel like this holy shit. i'm in bed with my favourite jumper on and reading through (trying to read through) advice and stuff to stay calm. there is a day tomorow at school where they talk about anxiety and i'm fkn dreading it, i really don't want to go to school tomorow because i don't want to break down infront of everyone but i don't feel worried now?! honestly if i don't have one i'm gonna cry, but cry good tears. legit, anxiety is fkn hard and anyone with it will know but it feels good to not worry about 1 main thing for once. damn. also, my anxiety meds help out with depression so i am happy! and i'm never in a good mood on the evening .	😂
not content with content i've reloaded 8 times in the past 54 seconds. there are 10k teens online r/teenagers better step up their game or else i won't be entertained anymore.	😤
am i unaware of some etiquette or something? i have had to have a lot of maintenance done on my apartment, too much if you ask me (this apartment has one issue after another). i always offer the guys a glass of water or coffee. no one accepts. it's been lots of different people, but it's even stranger to me that the guy i see all the time never accepts. it's not that weird, but it makes me wonder if something i thought was polite is usually an empty gesture. like, "no one really wants the coffee, but you ask because it's polite." this was super random, but i'm just curious what people think do you think it's an apartment rule?	😂
yallz im getting old :( i'm 14 years old now but i look like im 12. my mom tried to dress me today but luckily i went back to my dads house and dressed myself	😎

are guys really just that simple? hi guys, woman here, trying to figure out what goes on inside of the male head. how do you guys express how you like someone? is it just a waiting game? is being called a friend by a guy the same way a girl calls someone a friend? i have many questions, but please throw some facts at me before i start psychoanalyzing everything	😩
a pair of jeans i know this is dumb and superficial. i couldn't fit into these pair of jeans that fit me well when i was thinner 2 years ago. and i tried them on today and they fit, given not as well as they used to, but they are going to. and it really is dumb and superficial but i used to struggle with an eating disorder in high school and worked hard to stop, gained a little weight, lost it again and then gained a lot of weight and then am starting to lose it to where i was 2 years ago. it's probably a trivial thing to some people but i have sometimes been tempted to throw up again and starve myself if i ate a big meal that day, but i never do, and i dont really look at the scale anymore and i dont hate myself or my body as much anymore. and i don't really have anywhere to share this but i wanted to say it even if no one is listening.	😅

how does one find their own talent, powerful skill, any meaningful worth or value. in no way do i think i have depression or am sad. i probably don't have any mental issue, at least nothing diagnosed, nor would i acknowledge if i'm insecure. however, i seek to find my talent. that, or debunk the statement that everyone has a a talent. while i'm not saying i'm shit at everything, but i'm mediocre at best with most things in the world. while naturally that should make me disbelieve in whether everyone is talented, i've seen that among everyone around me, starting from my family, where my eldest sisters a great singer, my other sister can draw portraits with excellence, even my brother, who despite being 8 years my senior and still living with my parents, is a superb driver and has great knowledge with cars. both my parents where objectively talented, my mom was top in gymnastics while my dad is a respected author among other things like poetry etc. all my friends had several talents each, both the ones i grew up with and the ones i met since moving to uni. me here, i'm just there, i can get things done, i pass all my shit and all but still have nothing too unique to be proud about. i play video games but i'm quite incompetent at them, i'm not afraid to express my opinion in public but i can never grab their attention, i tried making memes but failed terribly. i can talk to girls, and i have gotten lucky a couple of times, but have i ever had a girlfriend? not even close. while i don't feel unconfident, but i always find everyone having something special but never me, i mean i have friends but even my only best friend doesn't consider me his best friend, rather one of his, what he likes to say, close 5. all my other friends, they don't put too much effort in maintaining our bond, i mean i always had the duty of strengthening my friendships once they got to know me, because once i don't they'll drift away and i become indifferent to them. holy shit, i even find myself doing that with my siblings now that i moved out. i find it impossible to inspire other, i make friends but they quickly lose interest. the two types of friends i had are either introverts who want to appear sociable in front of others using me, or people that i help with school stuff, i mean i'm never automatically invited to anything, i have to ask if there's anything happening. the only person that i struggle to understand why he actually seems to care about me is my bestirring i mentioned earlier, i mean even if he doesn't put the effort of a bestfriend he does put the effort of a friend for a reason i'm not sure of, nor is he. my parents often told me when i was younger that i have this "thing" and it will be greatly expressed once i'm in uni, but here i am, nothing special really, none bad, none good, just there. thanks for reading if you managed to get here lol. oh, and please, none of that you're talented at being talentless bullshit.	😂

need thoughts and answers to this question about my girlfriend and our relationship summary because reddit sucks: girlfriend is pregnant with a supposedly straight again from being gay guy but she loves me and is only carrying his baby so i have a girlfriend. it's our third week anniversary today and she told me that 5-6 weeks ago she actually had sex with her gay best friend (i'm not saying i hate lgbt i support it but) and he came in her first time as he wanted to experiment with gil's then they had sex another two times with protection. she really does love me and says she doesn't love him but she feels it's best to "date him until the baby is old enough" and she also told me that the gay best friend has now turned straight. i love her and don't want that guy taking her away from me i don't know. is he just doing this because he got my girlfriend pregnant. i need comments back. i truly love her and if my girlfriend ever sees this post one day i want her to know that i love her and won't let go please tell me more than one sentence everyone --- **tl;dr;** : i need answers to this question	😔
i (31m) am having a hard time trusting partner (37f). are these red flags? tl;dr at the bottom! hey there. i have some really big issues when it comes to trusting my gf. she was with a guy (mid40s) for fourteen years prior to having met me. in the beginning i let her know that i was extremely insecure about their contact, and so she actually went and blocked him from social media. or so i thought. because she had actually had him blocked for about two years before i even met her. i thought: "why not just tell me that he was already blocked, instead of saying that he was now blocked because of me. i don't get it. and, his number was never blocked. she had just deleted him as a contact, but she knows his number, so i guess she just didn't want to be in a situation where his name would pop up unannounced on her phone while i was there. made me feel like crap. she kept saying she was over him, didn't want nothing to do with him and that it was over a long time ago. didn't want any contact. so why not just blocking his number? four months in, on my birthday, we were out having some nice dinner. she told me they had been texting for about two weeks, because he had fallen ill. a blood clot. he needed an operation. she went and stayed with him before, during and after. i felt like shit, and i felt like she never really meant what she had said about not wanting nothing to do with him. she basically kept defending him and their relationship. not much i can do about that, but i again felt like shit. she doesn't want him in her life, wants nothing to do with him, but she's going to be there whenever he is in need? i get it, it's nothing to do with him, heck, i know he didn't choose to get sick. now, i don't like the guy. he had basically cheated on her their entire relationship, his bdsm activity with 18year olds and he had 'borrowed' tons of money from her. never paid her back. i've never met him, and i don't need to. problem is, she goes out of her way to take his side as he is "sick" and that she has forgiven him. one day, about two months ago, he texts her. he wanted some therapy bells back that she had at our place. she immediately goes out of her way to bring said bells to his mothers house. that way she could go say hi to her former mother in law, who she sees as her own mother. all he had to do was yell "get them to me" and she did just that, left me at home and drove off. again, i felt unprioritized. one day he had driven past us in town, and he winked at us, which i didn't see. he then texts her " hey, did you see the car? ?" she texted back" yeah, nice car"! he fucking owes her immense amounts of money, and she just comply to his way of conversation in that tone? i felt like, no matter how much he had been fucking her over, he's still got his way with her. she still tells me she wants nothing to do with him, doesn't want no contact and doesn't want him in her life. she still keeps his number open though. she still defends their relationship. she still tells me she doesn't love him or think about him and that he means nothing. but she'll go out of her way to argue that he was 'the one that was there for her when her mother died' and that he was the one that was there for her when she went through depression two years ago, where she was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. now, i can't seem to make sense of anything she says anymore. i don't know if i can trust her, because she has a way of actually changing things that she has said, in a way that makes it seem so innocent later on if i bring it up. she'll actually 'forget' what she had texted him, 'forgetting what had happened those times they were in contact'. sometimes this makes me feel like i am in the wrong. that's how this makes me feel. now, i'm aware of my insecurities, and i know that i am in constant need of reassurance. i just don't know anymore. i need help here. i have literally no close friends, not much family (i'm from a very broken household). my gf has gifted me a bunch of stuff. some expensive stuff as well. but sometimes she'll use them as an actual argument as to how much she loves me. she uses those things against me. my late mother did the exact same thing. i haven't really been in many relationships in my life. and most of them were before i became an actual adult. now were at a place where she knows all my insecurities about the ex and her, and it's a silly fucking place to be. i'm not much of a man at all right now. i'll tell her that i have 'jealous thoughts' and she knows it's about them. so she is in complete control. she'll comfort me, and tell me he doesn't matter and that he means nothing, wants nothing to do with him yada yada, and i'll feel a little comfort. at least for like five minutes. other red flags, that are unrelated to the ex: - she sees herself as a medium. talks to spirits and stuff. and her dead mother has 'come through' on multiple occasions before we met, and told her about me. at first i laughed it off (nervously haha) but not so much anymore. she seems somewhat disconnected from this world. - she is bipolar type 2, as stated earlier. in the beginning there was an instance where we were cuddling in bed, and she told me about how stressed out she was from everything in her life. she had the most manic freaking smile i ever did see. it frightened me. i tried playing it cool, and said something like; well you've got to take care of yourself, babe'! the smile dropped for about half a second, but came back even bigger. no emotion in her eyes. it freaked the living shit out of me. on numerous occasions i've had a eerie feeling about her state of mind, but nothing too big. - she is a science major. she is very inconsistent. she stays home about 40% of the time, doesn't do the work she needs and she'll rely almost always on me being there for cuddles and kisses. i'm not a great example myself, since i have no job at the moment (i'm undergoing therapy, and am seeing a doctor who is looking into whether or not i have borderline personality disorder. he is pretty sure that i do. now, i've never been taking any responsibility towards bettering my own situation. i've always ended up places more of as a result of circumstance than choice. it's really my own fault. but i'm becoming more aware of my traits as a human, and i know that i need to find comfort in myself and make a living for myself in the long run. i'm starting here, trying to reach out, because i need objective opinions on this. i would really appreciate it if you would leave me a comment, tell me what you think. whether you think i'm in the wrong or not, please leave me something. even just words of comfort. even if you have ever been in anything remotely similar, or are as insecure as me. tl;dr: i'm getting a lot of mixed signals from my gf, especially with regards to her ex and the contact they're having. she'll say she doesn't want him in her life and wants no contact, but she'll go out of her way to defend him. he had treated her like dirt, and she still seems very strongly about him. i didn't know what to think. thank you for reading. thanks for your time. love from scandinavia!	😁
holy shit i did it i just do your mom	😏
the bank turned my parents down my family moved to a different state several months ago. my husband and i had to stay back because we had just signed a lease on an apartment. but we are so miserable in this horrible area. it genuinely drains the life out of you to be here. the air is even heavier here. we live in such a miserable, soul-sucking area where we are both depressed and so lonely. my parents applied for a mortgage to buy a home because right now they're living with my dad's parents and they're very horrible and selfish people who treat my family very badly. they found several homes they were interested in and they all had a finished basement or an apartment area, so my husband and i could move in with them temporarily when our lease is up. that way, we could get out of this valley and it wouldn't be so financially stressful. because we are so poor my mom just told me the bank called and denied the loan. all because of missed payments on a van almost 10 years ago. they've been working so hard on their credit and doing everything they can to build it up, but it still didn't work out. if anybody deserves a home, it's my parents. they haven't owned their own home ever, to my knowledge. they've raised 4 kids, and been so poor for so long. it's just not fair...i feel like i've been punched in the gut. i was so hopeful that things would finally work out for them. (and also for us.) ugh. this situation sucks.	😭
i asked my crush out... so after our date that we went on yesterday, i told my crush how i felt and basically asked her out, and she said she liked me back! but, she said she needs some time to decide what she wants right now... well atleast its part of a win i guess. here's hoping she makes up her mind soon cause the wait is killing me haha. atleast i got what i had to off my chest and i feel much better now.	😅
oceanography teacher is fake af she's always coming in all sunshiny then flies off the handle at 7 in the morning at us. nobody ever knows which move on thursday, she left the classroom for like basically the whole period when she wanted to start the final a day early; then when she finally walked back in like 10 minutes to the bell she slams my purse down on the desk behind mine as she made another kid sit in my desk (she thinks we're going to cheat for some reason). then yesterday morning another kid walked in as the bell was ringing and she lambasted him when she's never on time herself. such a fucking hypocrite. i tried getting my schedule changed but of course she's the only one who teaches the special ed version of the class i'm so sick of her attitude and am so glad monday is the last day of classes so i hopefully won't have to see her ever again as i don't need to take another science class next year (in nys we only need three years of science). fuck her. the class and the class we had first semester could've been great but of course she has to make it a horror show. dae here have a teacher similar to mine?	🙄

please help me find these books from 90s hello im looking for x3 books that i can not for the life of me remember the name of, however i remember some details: 1. a very vintage looking book, and on the pages it had a room from different dolls houses. and then it had writing next to it which im presuming was information about who made it, (i only used to look at the pictures being young) 2. a childrens book that was hardback and grey, on the front cover it had a girl with orange frizzy hair called lizzie, and she had an umberella and wellingtons on, lizzie had the day of school. she started to make invitations to a party, she offered to swap some carrots for raisins to a friend. her and a friend made some jam biscuits together and plated dress up. she also went to the park and played in the see saw with her friend in the rain. 3. a book about a a young witch who i think maybe called wilma? she goes round casting spells on her family and neighbour, and each page has an envelope attatched to it with a spell card inside, and at the end you put all the cards together and it makes out a picture of a house (the girl ends up turning into a house) any help would be greatly appreciated thank you! :)	😭

making a weird first impression to my next door neighbor this isn't necessarily a fuck up but it's pretty funny so i thought i'd share. this happened when i [m] was 15. we had just moved into our brand new house, and while we were getting things settled inside, my dad asked me to run out to the car to get something. i go outside to the car and i open the passenger side door and got what he was looking for, but then i realized there was oreos in the glove compartment. i got inside the car, closed the door and started eating the oreos. i'm very passionate about oreos, so i was really enjoying them-- i'm talking with my chin up in the air and my eyes rolling to the back of my head. as i had a mouthful of oreos, i went to grab another one, but i look out the window to see my next door neighbor just staring at me and then just slowly walk in his house. so that was a great first impression tl;dr - the first impression i made to my next door neighbor was me eating oreos with my eyes rolling to the back of my head because of how good they were	😂

doing the orange justice dance my last post got deleted so lemme try this one again.... like most tifu posts, this happened a couple of weeks ago, but today i f***** up by doing the orange justice dance. lemme start from the begging: 2 years ago, when i was 16, i had this terrible rugby injury, where i dislocated my kneecap, and ripped the ligament holding it in place. for any of you that has had this before, you'd know that it is the worst pain in the world, the pain feels like if you jumped off a chair onto a broken leg, mixed with the constant cramp pains for the next few weeks (not to exaggerate haha.) anyway, through rugby i repeated this injury 8 times, and one more time through someone managing to directly hit the side of my kneecap, but thats a story for another day. last year when i was 17, i had to have a knee operation (acl reconstruction) which basically strengthens the ligament, meaning that the kneecap shouldn't dislocate anymore. the operation was a success, but i decided not to play rugby anymore as i was not worth the potential injury. anyway, a couple of weeks ago, i graduated high school here in the uk. i went to a party the day we finished, and there was a disco. everyone was very drunk (calm down r/fbi the legal age is 18 here) and we were all dancing. being the stupid 18 y.o. that doesn't think about consequences, i decided to join in with the dancing. thats when someone at the party (who probably thought he was the funniest thing since steve carell) thought it would be good bant to put on "orange justice soundtrack 10 hours." we were all confused as to what it was, but when we realised the soundtrack we wanted to see who could do the best dance. ofc being the drunk and overly-competitive 18 year old that i am, i joined in. big mistake. the moment that i got to the 2nd clap, my kneecap shot out of the socket, and stayed that way. it was the worst pain i've felt in ages, and then finished the night being carried into an ambulance. due to the pain and my immobility, my "best summer ever" consisted of me missing the week of parties after graduation, and had to cancel a holiday with my friends to a festival that we'd been planning for ages :(((( . to top it off, when i was using crutches next to my playstation, i accidentally pressed on it and caused a giant crack on the top shell. on the bright-side however, being immobile really makes time to practice with the hunting rifle. to conclude: don't be an idiot when you have a knee problem, maybe the drinking age should be 21, and don't use crutches near a playstation on the floor. also, as i am still fairly immobile, my fortnite username is williamclubb3 if anyone wants to play tl;dr: had a knee operation, liked fortnite a bit too much, ended up ruining my summer.	😅
going through a break up. could use a friendly conversation. as the title states, going through a break up that i'm not dealing with well and i could just use a friend. i don't mind what we talk about, just kinda trying to get my mind off things. i will apologize in advanced if i'm a bit down in the way i talk but it's a fresh wound. just trying to move on and find ways to cope. i promise i'm not usually this morbid	😂

my work has a safety fair every year where there are all sorts of games and prizes and a women that facilitated one of the games helped me win... my first prize that day i work at a refinery so this safety fair is a big ordeal. as you can imagine the women to men ratio isn't very even. you would think this would create some sort of comradory amongst the women but you'd actually be more surprised how competitive it makes women! so i was pleasently surprised when the women (from a different company) nudged the beanbag into the winning hole. its the little stuff but i thought it was very sweet and took it as a compliment.	😂
how do i [16m] handle being with a shy girl [16f] who doesn't know/isn't confident enough to be affectionate? i've been with her for two months, but we've known each other for around 3 years. basically, she has trouble with affection. i, on the other hand, crave it. she told me that it's because of low self-esteem, so it's hard for her to be affectionate due to nervousness. it isn't just stuff that would come further down the line, basically, anything indicating a fondness for each other is avoided on her end (i.e. a heart from me is met with a from her, she never does anything to show that she likes me, etc). it really gets to me sometimes because the only thing i can go off of her liking me is her word (which she rarely ever says). i feel bad, because i don't want to pressure her into doing things she's uncomfortable with, but at the same time, it's emotionally draining trying to flirt or be affectionate with her never reciprocating. the main reason i don't leave is that other than that, she's an amazing girl and i know i would regret it if i did. how should i go about this? should i be affectionate, or should i just let her be?" tl;dr she isn't affectionate due to self-esteem, i, on the other hand, need it, don't know how to go about this. help?	😊

squirting on an old lady on the metro this happened a few days ago, but i didn't get the chance to post it until now my friends and i were looking for fun things to do around shanghai, and one of the easiest forms of travel in shanghai is the metro. after meeting up at a station, we got on a train headed towards a tourist stop and sat down. my friends had eaten breakfast beforehand, but they were nice enough to brought me a few shanghai breakfast items, one of them being xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). however, at that moment i had forgotten that there was soup in the dumpling i was eating, so as soon as i bit into the first dumpling, the hot juice that was trapped inside came bursting out like a doughy pimple, right onto the elderly lady who was sitting in the seat right in front of me. after what seemed like minutes of eyewatering, embarassing eye-contact, i dug out a packet of napkins and wiped off her leg, shamefully returning the rest of my breakfast to its bag for later consumption. tldr; be careful what you put in your mouth in public	😅
what do you guys think? i broke my phone so now i only have my apple. i love this phone but i like having a samsung with it for other stuff.. my aunt is most likely gonna give me her s8 but i'm scared. people are odd and cruel around here and throw shit at people (my friend had a bicycle thrown at him lmao) for being ''poor'' so basically...this is petty..but if she gives me the phone should i keep it in my pocket where people can't see it? like just in public. only because some people call anything outside of an apple or a new samsung 'poor' and 'old' i just don't want bullied or have people smash the phone. i've seen that shit happen too many times with the dudes here that love to flex their parents money. (they are like 15-16 and refuse to wear anything but supreme, or top of the line expensive shit) this is petty ik but i'm a pussy	🙄

i love single-player video games but honestly only ~5 good ones come out a year and it's not enough i guess because it's so much work to create big budget games. i love all types of single-player games but i always play them so quickly then am back to waiting for the next one i'm interested in! this year i played god of war, detroit: become human and spider-man. i'm really excited for a few in 2019 but that seems so far away!	😭
leaving the subreddit for a while. hey everyone, due to recent posts i'm going to be leaving the sub for a while until stuff is all sorted out and dealt with. it's so sad to see all these posts and i do wish that those people could reach out and actually get the help they need. i recently had some stuff happen that's just been sorted out but i really can't deal with seeing other people being suicidal, it really gets to me and i do wish that they could get the help they deserve because no one deserves to be in that mindset especially at our ages. if you're feeling depressed or suicidal please contact the relevant people in your country, you have so many ways to talk to people about how you feel and whats going on in your mind, suicide isn't the option, i know it feels like it can be and how low you can get, trust me, i've been like it many times before, but life gets better, i know that sounds stupid but it does, it really does, so please reach out to people and talk to them. peace out boys, seymmelb	😎

exposing my breast to an elderly gentleman my husband and i were at home at night and i was breastfeeding my baby daughter when he heard someone outside our house. he called out, "you right there mate? can i help you?" a man replied that he was looking for his wife and was a bit lost. damn straight he's lost, we're at the end of a street with bushland on 3 sides and it's pitch black. my husband told him to come around the front and answered the door (rolling pin in hand ) to see a very elderly gentleman covered in bugs and sticks. he said he needed help. we invited him inside and handed my sleeping baby to my husband so i could call the police... forgetting i had been feeding her. i stood up with my boob all the way out and completely uncovered. cue averted eyes and an awkward silence i called the police and there was a missing persons alert out for him, so we waited while making awkward conversation until the police and his family arrived. turned out he had alzheimer's so he might not even remember but it's not a high point for me tbh	😂

how do one become addicted to running? hi when i read about running and jogging, i saw a lot of post mentioning becoming " addicted " to running... but how do one become so? i started to run 2 weeks ago, i can actually feel my stamina increasing, which is my main goal. but after each run i just feel awful. my legs hurt, my feet hurt, somewhere around my chest hurts. after each run i keep asking myself : why the fuck am i doing this ? i come home super tired which makes it hard to do anything else but nap. i spent 4 hours today running and napping :/ i must be doing something wrong, because unlike everyone else i am totally not getting addicted to running... please help	😭
asking girl(s) to be my valentine oke doke. so here we go. here's me. this girl is so special to me. perfect, gorgeous, blue eyes and blonde hair. also the nicest calves i've ever seen on a girl. so decided to ask her to be my valentine on monday but there was a guy with her so i backed out. the next day i coudn't find her. so on wednesday i ask her. turns out her grandma died and she just wants alone time sooooooooo she said no. and i'm like f*ckif i asked her earlier she would have said yes. so cutting to thursday i ask another girl. a dancer who is pretty fit. smart and pretty with glasses. she says; "my mums just getting me chocolate so i don't need a man to get me any ahaha but i'm sure you'll find someone you're a really great guy and someone would be so lucky to get a gift from you ." so i'm like double f*ck. so then i ask another girl who's smaller than me which is pretty hard to find. she's a youtuber so give me some clout. turns out she also had a valentine. and i'm like triple f*ck. then i ask a one of my closer friends that is a girl, also a dancer and pretty cute she replies; " aw that's really sweat but i'm sorry i don't really do valentines." like wtf you don't do valentines??? quadruple f*ck. finally i ask my closest girl best friend, who is the most amazing girl ever. she replies; "hi chinny, that's very sweet and thoughtful thank you :) but i'm very sorry i can't. hey don't stress if you don't have someone for valentines, it's not an awful thing 🏼." like wdymm you can't wtff. so that's the fifth time i've got rejected for valentines in a row. still don't have anyone for valentines. that's why they also call it "singles awareness day". **tl;dr** ; i asked 5 girls to be my valentine and they all said no.	👍

how long since your last relationship and why did it end? as for me it's been a relationship lasting three years and ended about two years ago since i apparently changed a lot after a stay at a hospital. i appreciate the good times but aware it wouldn't have worked out further anyway. sad thing is we aren't friends anymore, which is always a shame and which probably is why i avoid relationships. your turn	😊

i think i helped someone on the london underground today hello everyone, first time poster here. i entered pimlico station this morning for victoria line northbound after i had a tooth extracted. i was feeling pretty crappy, needless to say. in fact, now i have stomach cramps and vomiting. great. anyway, there was a middle aged seeming chap sat on the bench when i entered and it was clear he seemed really unhappy. just looked depressed and distant. i got on the train and he didn't get on. odd i thought, only one line operates there so he's not waiting for another.. then it struck me. you hear the stories. thankfully he glanced at me and i offered a smile (well, a half smile on account of the anaesthetic) and he smiled back. but a kind of.. unhappy smile, you know the kind of forced smile that people in despair make. i decided to get off at the next stop (victoria) and inform the tfl staff on the platform. they radiod pimlico and i went on to board the next train. goodness knows what happened to the chap, but i didn't hear of any.. incidents. wherever you are friend, chin up mate. all will be ok	👍

i think i've been replaced with a bowl of ice cream. i decided to hang out and play video games with my friends today, which means my girlfriend gets mad at me for some stupid reason like she usually does and calls me either angry or crying, making all of my friends uncomfortable (it's sad when one of your friends is fine with pausing a game of 2k just to have your girlfriend yell at you). so anyway, one of my friends was laying back after dinner and he told me to check instagram and my girlfriend posted a picture of a bowl of ice cream with the caption "my new boyfriend". like i spent the holidays with you, there's no way you're having separation issues already! so, how was your day? anyone want to talk about anything?	😂
not to brag or anything, but... i smell really good, right now	😁
me (27f) and my boss (32m) aren't getting along me and my boss, dan, haven't been getting along. i have been his employee for about a month. we are currently on a work trip in another country. we are originally from america dan is a mostly cool guy, but can have very strong opinions. we we're getting a long pretty well at the beginning, but lately, he has been being extra critical and even cursed at me during work. i am a happy go lucky, always smiling, but have a tendency to question myself (i can lack confidence sometimes). dan is a gruff guy/father who deals with depression and can sometimes lash out with anger. me and dan have to hang out a lot, therefore i have told him a lot about my family history. my brother has schizophrenia and i have pretty intense ptsd and well-sibling syndrome from it. me and dan bonded one evening over the fact that he was once homeless and had a very abusive household. at least i thought we did. anyways, one morning we were talking and i mentioned the tv show "haunting of hill house". i went into the plot and how i thought it was very reminiscent of grief and mental illness. he got very upset with me and said "why can't you just enjoy a simple haunted house show instead of bringing your shit into it". his attitude has been progressively worse. i had to l start avoiding hanging out with him outside of work (we are in another country, so we are the only people we know). we were working one day and i set a pair of gloves next to me that i had taken off to tape something and he yelled "hand me your fucking gloves" i said "i'm going to be using them in a second" and he goes "no you aren't! hand them to me!" he was shaking with anger and it was honestly kind of terrifying for something that seemed so trivial (i was working in a piss and dirt filled area so i had gloves to keep my hands from getting contaminated). i finished the job perfectly, but my hands were gross (hopefully i didn't contract pink eye, thanks boss) i've been doing my job for 5 years, i am rather good at it, but this boss makes me feel like a fucking failure. he belittles me(there are too many stories to count) and stands over my shoulder to watch me do jobs a newbie could do. it's honestly exhausting. i'm constantly on edge. i went from getting letters of recommendation, winning employee of the quarter, doing huge projects on my own and being a stand in sup, to being belittled and treated like a child... what do i do? how do i make him not hate me? tldr; my boss hates me, how do i make him not hate me?	🙃
i prolly won't last long on reddit i don't even know what to do here	😐

there are so many dogs at this coffee shop! i know i'm supposed to be people and hence be more interested in hanging out and talking with the humans here, but the dogs are more fun. there's this little black one with stubby legs and he's just cute i'm gonna die! so yeah, i'm failing at human interaction because dogs. how have cute doggies recently distracted you? also if you've got doggies share their antics! update: the black dog is frankie and he's a rescue who doesn't usually like guys, but he loves me! his owner let me feed him a treat! update 2: frankie has to go. bye frankie! update 3: long haired weiner dog with a poofy tail! she's shy, but i think she's just guarding her chew toy. update 4: myrtle is brown and white and sooooo happy! update 5: big dog with white chest floof wandering freely around! he's so cute!	😭
amas on r/truegaming - who would you like to have on? so let's just jump right in. this sub is the perfect place to host amas with game designers and developers, as well as producers, game executives, and journalists, and ask them questions about our favourite games. we're certainly a large enough community to incentivize developers to come and talk about both their games and the industry. over the next month the mod team is going to start emailing developers/designers/industry people and scheduling amas. if there's a game you want to know more about (old *or* new, aaa *or* smol indie) from its developers, a studio, specific game developer, executive (reggie???), or any journalists that you would like us to reach out to, please let us know here and we will do our best to get them on here for an ama. thanks	😊
girls love me, but none of them want to date me. i guess they just like observing from a far. they laugh at all the jokes, they always look at me for help. but none will date me.	😔
went to a summer camp for a couple days... came back to 69 memes from my girlfriend she's a keeper	❤️
you just don't understaaaand tbh, this is really cringy to say, but sometimes i can't deny that i mean it. i am sure all of us had that situation. i had that moment when i wanted to dye hair. boys don't usually dye hair ik, but i wanted to. then i did it anyways without telling them. had fun.	😭
i like my women how i like my kfc *thighs,* legs and more *t h i g h s* (unfortunately they do not serve chicken feet at kfc )	😢
trying to get into shape screwed me over i feel like the universe just doesn't want me to change. maybe you can find some amusement in my predicament, cause it is hilarious in a way. three months after i started medical school, i came up with the idea of getting healthier. "practice what you preach," my dumbass said. i started working out, dieting and drinking more water and boy did it backfire . i had to go to the hospital last night because my "dieting" gave me terrible stomach pain and no amount of antacids seemed to work. my increased water intake resulted in a sudden inability to control my bladder when it was full. i woke up one night having wet my bed because i was drinking too much. all i need now is to get injured while i'm working out lmaooo. *getting healthier,* my ass. that's been my past few weeks. how's your life going (i hope to god it's better than mine lol)?	😂
can i get an f in the chat the girl i've been talking to for a few weeks who i thought liked me just texted me asking for advice after hooking up with a guy from the restaurant she works at . i'm happy for her and i'm happy that we're close enough friends that she felt comfortable texting me about it but i'm feelin kinda bummed right about now	😔
they always say nice guys finish last i'm a nice guy and when i have group masturbation with my friend i always finish last	😔
turns out my friend lied lmao shes said her mom only let her have 1 friend over but rn she has 7 really sucks because i havnt been anywhere is a while and only in town for today	👍

i saw howie mandel i saw him yesterday in venice beach in socal and didnt realize at first but but got super excited when i did wowie it was howie so cool	😂
i have a crush... guys idk what to do!!!!! i have a crush on this guy in my class, he's super cute, he's a little quiet and shy but he's definitely my type! but my bet friend likes him.. even tho typically she's attracted to.. well hillbilly's. he is not a hillbilly by any means. i haven't had the courage to talk to him, and i don't want my friend to get mad at me. idk how to talk to him! there's also another guy, i've liked for like two years but i feel like i don't have a shot with him, cuz he's definitely more country, and popular. idk . my friend also liked him and he's always talking to her, they're friends, and she keeps telling me things like "he's told me alot of stuff, but i can't tell you" even though i'm her best friend. typically i'm the more empathic person, but people ignore me and judge me, and they like her. then there's a girl. she had a crush on me before i came out to myself. soooo i freaked out. people say she still likes me, and i kinda like her to! we used to be friends but she stopped hanging out with us cuz my friend doesn't really like lgbtq people. she kinda runs away whenever i'm near her or tries to talk to her, and she gets embarrassed easily but idk how to talk to her either!	😐
an open letter to the best friend i've ever had. to my closest friend i've ever had. thank you so much, and i'm sorry. you've listened to me when nobody else would, talked me through things professionals couldn't, and you've defended me from others when i couldn't do it myself. you took the roles nobody else fulfilled in my life. like a parent, like a brother brother. you treated me with respect and nurturing like nobody else has. when i started to internalize that you cared, i pushed you further and further out of my life. i was horrible to you. i'm sorry i pushed just a little bit too far, and i want my best friend back. even if we do begin talking again, our relationship won't ever be the same. it'll always have that tender scar, and fortified emotional walls. my heart hurts, and it's all my fault on this one. i'm crushed.	😭
tifu by finding out i'm lactose intolerant this actually happened over the weekend. a few years back my patients found out they where lactose intolerant after they got tested when they got sick of the constant diareah. when my younger brother was born we realised he had the same problem i have always wondered if i'm the same but we never thought too much about it. so back to the story, last weekend i decided to test myself to see if i was. what i decided to do was drink a 3l bottle of milk as fast as i could. i ended up drinking it in one and a half days. i was sore for a couple of hours and then my stomach couldn't handle it and i knew i fucked up. i shit so hard the toilet was painted a new shade of brown. t felt like firecrackers where going off. turns out i am lactose intolerant too.	😅
was bored krusty crab pizza is the pizza for you and me	😂

time for some thursday questions! 1. would you rather have a boy or girl 2. do you collect anything? 3. what are you reading? 4. is it cold where you are? how cold? 5. describe to me your ideal living space. condo? actual house? townhome? one of those giant ass rvs? mine: 1. a little girl. my payroll manager has the most adorable little girl. i think she's one or 15 months. i mess around (in a non-shitting where you eat kind of way) with mom and we found it kinda funny how her daughter loves me. she always waves, smiles or what have you at me. one day when mom brought her to work, the little girl kept running out of her office to come see me. apparently she really likes guys 2. funko pop, haven't bought any in a while however 3. a mass effect fan fic. male shepard/liara romance 4. pretty cold for us floridians. 51 now, has around the 30s this morning 5. condo in la, santa monica, or san francisco. very contemporary, rainfall shower, lots of dark woods, a nice patio with a view of the ocean or city. have both a tv/game console area and a nice pc in front of my bed. get one of those fancy lg curved monitors. play pc games in bed or watch youtube videos.	😂
hey girl are you from russia? cause you stalin, just get in bed with me already	😳
be safe out there people so last night i went out with a friend. nothing too crazy considering it's a week night... some food, some drinks... chilled. after a while she points to my arm and points out what looks like a mosquito bite and we sort of laugh it off. the night goes well and i head home and have a great night's sleep. i wake up this morning with a itchy throat/mouth and both arms and legs *covered* in welts. yip, was allergic to something (possibly a preservative according to my dr.) that i drank. according to her i'm lucky my reaction wasn't worse because you obviously don't want a swollen airway while in a alcohol-sedated sleep. picked up some antihistamines and corticosteroids and i'm 80% hive and itch free now but it really got me thinking about how fragile we actually are... be careful peeps 🏼	👍

have you ever wanted something so badly? this is what i feel mostly these days. like i really want things to work out and all. whenever i think about it, my heart gets so full and i am so excited at the possibilities and all. on the other hand i understand the world is not a wish-granting factory esp when nothing is certain now. i may have have some problems managing my expectations	😢

that moment when you get arrested for production, distribution and possession of child pornography	😔
men are incapable of love?? as a bisexual woman, i've been (unfortunately) exposed to radical feminists/misandrists online where they have said that men are "physically, emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically incapable" of truly loving a woman not only because of your "privilege" but because of your moral shortcomings--according to them. other reasons of theirs have been because of men's "lack of empathy," "self-gratifying sexual needs," violent natures, shallowness towards appearance, needing to have women "heal" them, and lack of loyalty because of wanting to "stick it wherever they want." \[paraphrased.\] unfortunately, hearing these things can have a negative impact on a woman attracted to men such as myself. i've been hesitant to imagine a future with a man because of these things. why be with someone who is incapable of love if only women are capable of it? so, what are your thoughts about these stereotypes? no need to hold back, i need a dose of reality for a change.	🙄
someone add me on discord please i'm a dude looking for people to talk to, add me i'm andrew!#7777 we can talk about whatever you want lol i'm open to anything	😎

i miss my husband it's a first world problem thing and so, so selfish of me to complain and i havent anyone to talk to about it for those reasons. this week is his first at a full time job after being the stay at home parent for a year and a half. he loves his job! it's going great and i'm so incredibly proud of him. but i miss him he's understandably exhausted. it's a hard adjustment to go from stay at home dad to working full time! so he goes to work, gets home, acts as an exhausted person would - barely has a pulse - then pops off to bed four hours prior to the former normal bed time... i write this from the couch alone just wishing i could hug him some more. it's so lonely in the house now all day without him. i feel like a dog with separation anxiety.	😭
am i doing this workout thing right? apparently girls love abs. so when i asked my gf about it well i just mentioned it, she was like woowwwwwww you're gonna get absss wowwwwwww. me : *awkward smile* and now i'm trying to get abs. day before yesterday i downloaded a yt video saying abs workout for beginners. it had couple million views so i thought that'll be good. so today's my third day and my stomach hurts like hell i can't sneeze i can't get up from bed at once it's annoying. i thought maybe i'm getting abs. when i started working out today i found out that i can't do some moves(or whatever they are called) it's physically impossible. there's this thing where you sit and lift your straightened legs. when i try that my stomach hurts so bad i can't continue. my question is, is this okay? is that how it normally works? or am i doing something wrong and hurting myself? stuff about me: i'm 18, 5'10" and skinny	😩
so i sold my dirtbike because i can't risk getting injured with the job i have. i'm having withdrawals i was thinking i want to trade this dirtbike riding addiction off with rally racing lol. me and my buddy have been tossing around the idea of building our own rally car for cheap. only thing is this sport might be even more dangerous than dirtbiking	😂
my lower back hurts real bad it hurts ferociously. what do i do?	😢
7 things we do daily to stay sane and sober 👩 <url>	❤️
first kiss so today i had my first kiss (it was with girlfriend, im a girl) and we were trying to have it in private (nobody knows that we're dating and for other obvious reasons) and we we're really awkward about it so when i actually went in for the kiss i ended up being a little too aggressive (she didn't complain, so it wasn't too bad) and when we tried again, it went well. i just thought i'd share my story and give some advice - if you're nervous, don't be it's okay if it doesn't go to plan	😊
just done my first craft fair! buzzing! just got back from my craft fair. it's the first one i've ever done and i was really nervous! i was selling mostly cross stitch magnets and badges and also some necklace pendants. it took place at my work so now i'm worried everything has suddenly fallen apart no reason for that fear, just general anxiety! i am knackered now though!	😂
do you ever just get reminded of an injury you've had and get all nostalgic but squeamish? so lemme elaborate, i was just scrolling through reddit when an ask docs question about a shin catches my attention and just reading them describe what's wrong gets all the memories of my shin injury rushing back what the pain felt like, what the shin felt like to touch. i just got all nostalgic but remember all the pain and the crunchy feeling of the shin also made me really squeamish	😂
i'm bored so, i'll indicate a movie for each person who comment here based on what type of film they are looking for that's it 🏻	👍

wholesome fact... charlie from hazbin hotel is so wholesome that when she even try's to look scary and intimidating she still looks pure smol bean!	😊
anyone else been embarrassed today? this happened today and it made me realise how bad i am with girls. basically i work in laser quest in the trafford centre (shopping centre) in manchester and there's this girl i see sometimes, she works as cleaner for the trafford centre, she's same age as me and honestly she a amazing and the people i was on shift with today knew i had this crush on her so there she is emptying the bins opposite my work and my work colleague chelsey starts nagging me to go over and ask for her number. obviously i didn't so eventually she ends up going out herself and saying how "theres a guy that works her that really fancies you" etc. i'm there hiding in the back shy and embarrassed, wtf was i suppose to do in the situation?! stand there i be like "y'alright babe" but at least it's broke the ice, so now she knows i actually exists	😂
how do i (25f) not drag my boyfriend (25m) down? guys, i am 25 and about 11 weeks pregnant. i've never wanted kids but i do accept it now. i'm having a horrible pregnancy where i'm sick all day and some complications. that's #1. to move to #2 , i have hated my job for about the past year and i just can't take it anymore. financially if i never go back, i'm fine. i save money for peace of mind. i need no opinions on quitting a job without one. #3 i just feel like i'm depressed. everyday is hard to get out of bed when you hate your job and you know you'll be sick. i know once i'm up i cannot eat anything i want (given up meat ) i've told my boyfriend how i feel but i haven't told him why yet. i want to be able to be honest but i don't want to feel like ok pulling him down with me by constantly being negative. i know sometimes people leave their depressed partners. i'll speak with my doctor next week.	😩
i really love my grandpa. he's a swell guy! he always tells me stories, he's always there when i need help and he's always interested in my intrests. like he tries his best to really communicate with me and even goes as far as to buy me stuff. hell i see him more as a father figure than a grandpa tbh. i honestly think i'm lucky yo have such a fantastic grandfather	😊

happy birthday to me i'm 18 yay, but i don't feel any different. time to go star in barely legal amateur porn i guess	😎
currently crying but ok i have the right to cry, i am a female. but like, tomorrow is my last day of middle school, don't get me wrong i hate that school and the people in it so much, but like i don't want to go to high school me going to high school means that i have 4 years until i'm an adult, 2 years until my parents force me to get a job to prepare for moving out, and in the next 4 years i'm going to be searching for a boyfriend like my life depends on it. it's just all the fun memories from middle school (mostly 6th grade) are flooding back, it makes me miss when i was happy, when i had a caring boyfriend(who i want back so badly even though i broke up with him), and when i was actually social with friends. but like tomorrow imma wear a dress, curl my hair, wear makeup and try my best to impress my crush in the 2 hours that we're actually at school idk what i was trying to accomplish with this, i just felt like you people should know	😂

when people mistake me for a mod cuz of red shield by my name why the fuck would you ever think i would be a mod, i'm offended	😎
i hate my senior year and my friends just make it worse my school decided that because of the high stress pandemic environment we live in today, that the best most stress relieving thing to do would be to take away electives and for someone that wants to study film in college, it doesn't help that you took away theater, which is the closest i could get to an actual film class. so now there's not a single class that i actually enjoy and want to take anymore. and to add to that, all of the fun teachers that would have made the boring classes interesting are gone, and we are left with teachers that go by the books. like this is my senior year, i'm done with all that elementary school shit. one of the few classes i thought would be fun is food history. basically, it's a branch of anthropology focusing mainly on how food has affected societies. i thought it would be interesting, because this isn't something we usually talk about. and the books that they gave us are legitimately interesting to read. but the teacher that we have this year makes it so much worse. every class, she has a "discussion" and she emphasizes the fact that she just loves to hear everybody's point of view, and that "every opinion is valid". but she completely disregards all of that whenever she speaks, because she teaches it like a place to spout her extreme liberal propaganda. like, it doesn't matter what you say in class, if you make any point from the right or center, or if you mention human rights, she guilt trips you with loaded questions or makes suggestions about how we should live in a communist society. so nobody speaks up except the people that agree with her. like, if you want to hear both sides, don't favor one side over the other. and i know that some readers are politically liberal but this isn't a personal attack on you or your opinions. it's just this teacher's bullshit, hypocritical lies. but the thing that really pisses me off about it is that my friends don't give a shit. i told them why i don't like this teacher and then they all said "we agree with you we just don't think it's that important." but this is just as hypocritical and bullshit as what the teacher says. if you agree with me, then that means you think that these one sided discussions are a bad thing. but now you're telling me that you don't care? don't tell me that you're preparing me for my future if you're just gonna waste my time. don't tell me that you want to listen to me if you don't want to listen to me. don't tell me that you agree with me if you don't actually agree with me. i feel like i'm alone in this fucking school. the curriculum, teachers, and even my friends are all against me. this shit sucks.	🙄
we out here one night at 2pm during summer around christmas time, i was in my room, walking home, on my way to work, my grandma was in the kitchen making pennies, because my sister lost her virginity again but this time she left it at her boyfriends cock in the barn. and her birthday is coming up yesterday, so i got her this self portrait some nigga drew, but he drew it in spanish, like how tf is she gonna understand that shit	🙄
how does one balance between adult life and video games? hey there! hope all is well with everyone. id figured to post here about something thats been bothering me for a while. more or less the title of this post. im 26 years old as of now, and i feel that drive to want to do something more with myself. late last year, i started pursuing my passion for music. feeling that gaming was slowing me down and eventually feeling bored, i sold my ps4. which i feel now was a mistake. gaming has been a huge part of my life to just let go, but at the same time i feel i'm wasting my life by playing more than working more. its as if the escape is more important than the reality. im sure many can relate or have stories to share. anything helps.	😁
can someone be my friend so i can run it in kyles face i in fact do have friends? there is no desperate flair so i picked serious	😤
guys, my online girlfriend is visiting tomorrow (update) so yesterday i made a post about this 27 year old woman named pedro from detroit who i started dating and it blew up you thought she was a catfish but we met in real life and she gave me her big surprise......gifts! [here's me and pedro in case you bafoons don't believe me](<url>)	😎
has someone done something kind to your child that just melted your heart and made you look at humanity in a different way? some guy was super sweet to my daughter today. it just made her day and it made my week. i find this happening more often. just taking a second and being supportive and kind to a kid can change their reality for the good. it can stay with them for a long time. it reminded me when i was a kid. i was being bullied at school and life was awful being a 8 year old. we were also very poor. i had this elderly neighbor who would take time out of his day to talk to me. he was a garbage man. he would always dumpster dive and bring us outdated candy. he would say "look at it before you eat it to make sure there are no bugs on it" he would tell me that i was smart and i had the prettiest eyes. he basically was the only person in the world that was kind to me. his name was henry and this was like 25 years ago. those comments and his kindness has always been close to my heart and helped me get through some hard times.	😂
i think i've finally reached that point where i just do not give a fuck about romantic relationships anymore. and it feels so freeing. i'd been kinda dating a guy for a while and it very recently took a turn into fwb territory, rather than a relationship. and for the longest, romantic relationships were what i really wanted (or so i thought, i guess). kinda shy, had a few 'relationships' here and there but nothing that lasted long or really worked. anyways after recent developments, i just said 'fuck it' to trying to find/build a romantic relationship and just steer straight into fwb and it's so much easier. it's so much simpler. we're friends, we like fooling around, and there aren't any 'feelings' to complicate it. we can both live our own lives as we please. so fuck the romance. all of it. i'm taking the high road from this point forward	😊
yeah i practice safe sex. and whats the best form of safe sex you ask? not having any	😎
my boyfriend (23m) and i (22f) mutually agreed to break up to work on ourselves, but i'm now regretting it. my boyfriend and i have been together for 2 years. before we met, i didn't want a boyfriend. i wanted to focus on myself but also wasn't ready yet to be in a relationship that close emotionally. however, i was too in love with him to stop it, so it's now been 2 years. our relationship has been great, but because i got too attached to him, i lost sight of my own goals. i feel like i haven't made any personal progress during the duration of the relationship, which has unfortunately affected it negatively. so after many discussions and failed attempts, we mutually decided to break up. it's been 3 days. we haven't talked since, our longest ever. we agreed to start talking again in 22 days in hopes of continuing as friends, but it's been the slowest 3 days of my life. i miss him so much. i've been so unproductive too because i'm so sad, so i'm not evening doing what i broke up for in the first place. because my goal is to be basically a modern "monk" my whole life on my quest to spiritual enlightenment, i don't even consider marriage (to anybody, even him) an option. but i love him so much and keep doubting myself on if i made the right decision to let him go. i know i'm too old to be this pathetic, but he's had such a huge impact on me and will always hold a special place in my heart. i love him more as time goes on. i'm scared too that i'm going to basically relapse once i see him again at the end of the 22 days. please help. i know this is what's best for me in the long run, but i can't see the light at the end of the tunnel right now. any feedback, help, or advice is very much appreciated. thank you. tl,dr: tbh basically how to get over breakup being i'm a whimp.	❤️

when is the right time to tell someone i like them? i've been friends with this girl i like for a while and i'd like to tell her i like her cuz i do. it's just that it might be too early. we've known each other for over a year and we've spoken and joked a little at school. but we haven't ever met outside of school as friends and just hung out ever. i have been doing subtle hints, for instance i asked if she wanted to be my valentine thoughts? also another question: is it okay if i just shoot a snap saying "hey, i like you! "?	❤️

relationship status unknown i asked.. maybe i told. idk anymore. but, this guy (25m) and i (28f) have been seeing each other since the end of march so not long. we have lots of things in common. we always have good conversation. we've gone out at least once a week since that time. and it's been super nice. then the other week he just didn't have time and of course i was a hormonal mess already. well that day he tells me he is bad at making time for other people. great fucking great. well i point out that i'm not asking for a full commitment right now just want time? well he hasn't actually asked to see me in the last two. we did see each other saturday at a mutual friends house we kissed it was nice. now the other part. that day he told me he has trouble making time. i also asked if i could go to a concert with him. and his friends. well he said yes to this..... doesn't mention it at all. i made an assumption and now i'm mad about it. i thought him saying yes actually meant like yes come like hang out with me and my friends. nope he went out to dinner with all of them i ended up basically doing nothing until the show. cool fucking story bro. now my adult internal person says why the fuck did you say yes if you didn't want to. or maybe he did want to and is just dense. who the fuck knows. im mad mostly for assuming and obviously not being clear enough. now i'm wondering if i even. should try. this guy is extremely cautious about being a relationship at all. but he likes me he said so. we always have a great time together. so wtf world why you hate me. rowr tl;dr idk what's going on guy says he likes me but isn't asking to see me.	😔

please stop putting soaps in ur coochie first of all lol you don't necessarily need to even use soap at all to wash the kitty cat, just plain water does the trick ! and it's actually the most recommended but, if you are not someone that is comfortable with just washing with water, or you think you still smell without using soap then use a mild soap with no fragrance or very little. tooo many little kids (and grown teens lol) are improperly caring for themselves. vagisil, douches blah blah are not necessary ! showering once or twice a day and washing the cooter is fine. these chemically produced products are not good for your vag! unless recommended by your doctor, do not use these products, just plain soap or water. also, if you are properly washing/ keeping clean and still smell (with the exception of humid areas,athletes, exercise, physical exertion or production of sweat) then go to a doctor! every vag has a smell but if it's something that is pungent and doesn't smell like normal go to the doctor pls! and do not stick or put soap/ or chemicals / or unsafe objects into your vagina ! please no ! how to wash: *with warm water (or mild soap), use cloth or hand to open the lips (labia) and wash the creases of your vag, as well as raising up your libs to expose the clit/hood and gently clean the area *rinse *dry it's just that i've seen and heard a lot of people that don't actually know how to care for themselves and just some advice.	😭

toxicity ain't it it's gotten to the point where my skin is clearing up, my mood is better, there is less conflict, my grades are getting better & my life in general is becoming pretty freaking awesome. why? because i realized i that i "lost" someone that i thought loved me. turns out, they just taught me that sometimes you just gotta love yourself. hope this helps some of y'all out. love, laney	❤️
i love days where i eat more than my body weight. okay, before we begin, yes, i am totally exaggerating. but i really love days where i just eat freely and enjoy every single piece of it. i constantly struggle with my weight and feeling like i need to starve myself to look a certain way. so the days where i just relax and eat whatever my heart desires (maybe more like my soul, because let's face it, my heart is not asking me for fried chicken ) feel so damn great to me. these are the days i am the happiest. and no, i don't eat like this everyday, and no one probably should, but damnit, i only have one life to live, and i am so thankful i am experiencing the joy of food without torturing myself. this may mean absolutely nothing to anyone else, but if anyone cares, just know you need to love yourself. starving yourself will not make you beautiful. you can eat foods that you think are unhealthy and still be a striving and lovely person. it's all about moderation and self love.	😂

update: the guy i [f/25] am seeing [m/31] didn't respond for 24 hours when we had plans original post (it got removed because i added an imgur link ) this is a very odd situation. i've been seeing this guy for about a month. we hang out/hook up every 2-3 days. yesterday he texted me and it went like this: him: hey what are you up to? me: i'm about to go to a pool party at your complex with some friends, i would invite you but i'm not sure how you feel about celebrating america ;) (he is german for reference - he lives in a huge complex where a lot of my friends live as well, so this is a very typical interaction) him: you traitor, haha, come by when you guys are done and we can watch a movie or have a marathon. i have snacks too me: okay, also can i ask a big favor? him: depends what it is me: i have the ice pops and didn't realize there's no freezer down here, would you mind if i put them in your freezer for a few hours so they dont melt? *no response for 4 hours, pool party has finished* me: hey we're finishing up here, i'm going to head over i went, knocked on his door, no answer. very odd. called, straight to voicemail. didn't think much of it and went home. called again this morning from a blocked number, again straight to voicemail. i had a missed call from a number i didn't know, and when i called back it was a magic jack number that wasn't accepting incoming calls. i'm not sure if it was him trying to reach me or just spam. it's now 3pm and i'm very weirded out. i thought about texting a mutual friends that works with him and just asking if he knows if everything is ok but i don't want to overstep, either. we all three hung out a few nights ago, but still....this guy isn't my boyfriend, just a guy i'm seeing. i guess i'm just not sure what the proper thing to do here is. there was nothing strange leading up to this or anything like that. i'm just worried something might have happened because his phone isn't working, but he and i aren't serious enough for me to do much. thanks in advance, guys! tl:dr: guy i'm dating isn't answering texts after he made plans, phone going straight to voicemail for last 24 hours, not sure if i should do anything about it update: he texted me: **hey all g no need to appologize! i just had a big nap then went to work without my phone. come round tonight if you like...i have washing and a football game to watch but we can hang for sure** tl:dr: everything is fine hahahah	🙃
i think i may be an extrovert? or maybe i'm just going crazy? this summer i've been taking summer classes in college. one of the first classes i took was a guidance class. i didn't take the class seriously i just kinda took it just to take on classes during the summer. during this class we discussed personality types including extroverts and introverts. i learned that extroverts usually get their energy from being around other people while introverts "refuel" by being alone. when i was very young something pretty traumatic happened to me and i changed into the total opposite of what i was. previously i was the class clown who just kept talking and talking until i was sent to the office lmao anyways, i turned into the angel of every class. i genuinely thought i "enjoyed" being alone. last week of high school i felt something changing. my depression wasn't t nearly as bad as it had been but i was pretty much in shock, i didn't know what was going on so everything remained the same for a while. fast forward to today.. i was feeling so tired all day long. i woke up at 5 went to school, worked out and again school. at 5pm i was already dead but i went to the gym again (long story) and i was hanging out with this guy.. well.. all while i was interacting with this guy it's like i went from being so exhausted to having so much excess energy and i didn't get it at all... i lifted maybe 3-4x what i usually do.. i didn't even know i was capable of doing that. for hours after this i was so fucking hyper lmfao. someone even asked if i was high i was so confused in the guidance class because we took this personality test based on actual research and it said i was an extrovert. i passed it off as it being crazy but.. i'm not sure what to think right now	😐
reaching under my pillow..oh the horror. this just happened. i was enjoying some wonderful post sexy time with my boyfriend. we're both blissfully rolling around under the blankets, whispering sweet nothings, and getting very sleepy. he has a waterbed that he usually keeps pretty chilly. i was wondering if the heater was on, so i reached under my pillow to feel if the water was warm enough or if i needed to get my electric blanket. he said it was fine, and i agreed. then i felt it. the impending fuck up. it felt like a little plastic piece of wrapper or tape. smooth and...crunchy...oh god... i said to him "aha! i found your candy wrapper!" and proceeded to manipulate between my fingers whatever this bit of unknown was to gain more information. not even thinking it could be something so...special. all of a sudden it immediately clicked in my brain as to what it was. the smoothness of it smashing in between my fingers..the little legs grabbing on to me for dear life..and the smell..oh god the smell...like cilantro's evil twin. i now had the guts of a stink bug all over my hand. the stench permeated the room. without a second thought, i threw the offender across the room and ran to wash my hands. fucker is cackling with laughter from the other room. i'll admit, it is pretty funny. anyway, i got the smell off of me successfully, but now i'm laying next to a snoring boyfriend, while i shudder at remembering the feel of that damn thing, in a room that smells of sex and stink bug. life doesn't get much better than this	😊

i'm into a guy but i'm friends with his twin sister let's call this guy josh and his twin sister joanna so i've met josh and joanna 2 years ago in a party .. but we were younger and not really mature recently (the past 2 months ) joanna and i started hanging out . and me joanna and josh went out before lockdown . that night i saw josh staring at me and touching his beard . anyways now we are chatting through social , and he always compliments me . i compliment him too cause i really like him and he is so kind but also shy . he's never been in a relationship before ( we are all in the same age 19 ) . there's no way of meeting him cause of lockdown(they say that it might last till half of december ) i don't want to ask him out because 1)i don't want to ruin my friendship with joanna since she might think that i'm only hanging out with her cause of josh ( i really appreciate her) 2) i don't want to do it and if i do he probably tell it to joanna need your advice please !!!!	😂
isn't it intensely interesting how so many people put forward a public view on a topic yet hold an opposite view privately? i saw a post on the front page about marijuana smoking being legalised in the same areas tobacco smokers can smoke in public and it hit me like a ton of bricks: publically, i'm all for legalise it, let people do their own thing, etc but privately i intensely hope it doesn't get made legal where i am because i cannot stand the smell. seriously, the beer garden at the pub smells bad enough, we don't need that extra smell! why are we such slaves to how people view us?	🤔

yesterday i overheard a wholesome conversation between teenage boys i didn't know where to share this but since it was wholesome, i automatically thought of this sub. so, yesterday, i was walking to college and got stuck walking slowly behind a group of teenage boys. they were talking enthusiastically to each other and i couldn't help but hear the conversation. b1 is boy number one, b2 is boy number two of course: b1: so i just started rewatching how i met your mother and it has been awesome! b2: oh i've rewatched it lots of times already. b1: did you know that the guy that plays barney is gay irl? * which is old news of course but in my country we don't have such a celebrity gossip culture so i waited to see what they were going to say about that* b2: yes. but omg! did you know the guy is actually a magician? he does tricks in the tv show but he is also a magician irl!! boy number two was just so enthusiastic about how neil patrick harris actually likes magic tricks, it made me smile. the fact that he was gay was completely brushed aside as normal and uninteresting and i guess i wasn't expecting that. when i was in high school my male classmates were really homophobic and because of that i was expecting these boys to say something dumb and rude, but no. gay was seen as something perfectly normal, magic tricks were the real topic i guess it just warmed my heart to see young men being open minded and not giving a fuck if someone is gay or not.	😅
telling a black kid in my class he should dye his hair with kool-aid. this was back in high school but it still haunts me to this day. i was in history class and our teacher had put us into study groups of 4-5. so naturally we weren't doing much of anything. the other kids in my group (two white kids and one hispanic girl along with j, the black kid) were talking about random things and got on the subject of hair dye. one of the girls was talking about going blond and this kid said, 'man i'd like to dye my hair red but it's hard for black people to dye their natural hair.' i was really into hair dye (still am) and had recently remembered a method of hair dye where yoh could use sugar free kool-aid and cold water to somewhat dye your hair. so i told him, 'you should dye it with kool-aid.' *i didn't know about the fucking kool-aid stereotype!* but you bet your ass everyone else at that table did. they all just sat there staring at me in mixed faces of horror and disbelief until j goes, 'daaamn sailo! ok so it's like that!' and just bust out laughing and everyone else started laughing as well. i was so damn confused. i didn't get what was so funny. and even though j laughed it off i think he was actually a little hurt because he avoided me for a bit. it wasn't until a few months later when i figured out by talking to friends what was so wrong about my statement and i wanted to die. i did apologize to j and explained that i didn't know about the stereotype. he was really cool about it and stopped avoiding me. still, goddamn. tldr: made a racist comment by not knowing about a stereotype.	🙃

does anyone else not really mind spoilers? i generally look up the end of tv shows and movies on wikipedia before i reach the end. if a winner of something is going to be announced and i know it's going round on twitter, i'll look it up. if i see a spoiler from someone else, i'm just like 'ooh' and move on (although i never spoil things for others myself). it probably helps that i have a really bad memory so often by the time i come to watch the bit that was spoiled, i'm still in suspense. there's a particular murder mystery that i've read the book of, listened to the audiobook, and watched the tv adaptation, and each time i couldn't remember whodunnit most people react with horror when i tell them this. is there anyone else out there who just really doesn't mind?	😂

relentlessly picking on my dad for accidentally spending $7 to priority mail ship himself a package, and then minutes later set my entire front yard on fire, nearly causing a massive explosion. my dad is beginning his first foray into selling merchandise on ebay. he went to the post office yesterday and spent $6.65 to send a package via priority mail with a tracking number to his very first customer. everyone except dad was sitting outside as my mother went to check the mail, walking back up with a familiar looking padded envelope. my mother is terminally ill and blind in one eye, but she loves to stay as active as possible, checking the mail means a lot to her. to her it means she's still able to live and do things instead of letting her illness define her. anyways, because of this, she could just make out the name, realizing it was addressed to my dad. as she approaches, i recognize the envelope and then see that is adorned with several "usps priority mail" stickers. just like the end of a saw movie, i began to have flashbacks and it all came together like a cheap plot twist in an m. night shyamalan movie: this man had mailed a package to himself. he had mistakenly put his address as the "destination" address and the customers address as the "return" address, because, and these are his exact words, "... i didn't think it mattered where you put the addresses, they know where it's going." so, of course, dad came outside shortly and sat with us, myself relentlessly picking on him the entire time. at one point, speaking about something unrelated, he said "i need to start saving all the money i can", to which i replied "well, you could stop spending $7 a pop to mail shit to yourself". dad's initial anger at the mistake had turned into genuine laughter and acceptance with his own stupid mistake. so, fun times had by all. twenty minutes later, i had started a small fire as everyone went inside for a few moments (intending on coming out with food to grill), and i sprinkled gas on the fire to get things going. edit: this fire was separate from the grilling fire. however, due to an integrity issue with the "amazing-spider man fruit punch bellywasher" cap that i had installed on the 5 gallon gas can because it fit damned perfectly, a sizable amount of gas had trailed out as i placed it a few feet away. somehow, the trail itself didn't instantly ignite. however, about thirty seconds later, it did. and almost instantly, the gas can itself caught fire, and spider-man's head just melted right the fuck off. realizing this was threat level midnight, i raced to go grab the water hose and get into fire marshall bill mode. by the time i had come back, my whole front yard was in full tilt "burn, baby burn! disco inferno!", so panic was beginning to sit in. prioritizing these raging karmic hell fires, i began to spray down the gas can itself. however, this resulted in two tragically unexpected events: 1. the gas can tipped over, with the rest of the bellywasher cap still pouring gas out with a steady stream, and 2. the force of the water splashed the gas out as it was streaming, which caused the yard fire to spread. "this is how it happened... this is how the daltonl227 died." i steadily worked on the head of the can, trying to prevent a massive explosion and an unwanted removal of facial and body hair via intense flame. second by second, flames spread, and the gas just kept on streaming. at this point, my dad has walked out on the porch. "mother fuck almighty!", he cries. by the time he had descended the wheelchair ramp, a miracle had enchanted the land: i had put the can flames out. now, i was able to focus on combatting the yard fire without the immediate threat of a pride-shattering detonation. as the fire came to an end after burning down most of the direct "front lawn" area (2 acre property in north florida - also explains why we didn't call the fire department, because this is florida. we don't do that "911" shit), my dad reflected on the situation. "don't feel bad, boy... i mean, this was pretty fucking stupid, but at least you didn't spend seven dollars to mail yourself a package". tl;dr: picked on dad for mailing himself a package on accident, karma bites my ass minutes later as i set my yard on fire and narrowly avoided a massive explosion. edit: clarified the fire was separate from the barbecue... i was semi-functional before the events unfolded, did not use fuel on a fire for food.	😂
gravity/ weighted blankets... ever try one? i came across a post in another sub from a person who said their gravity blanket was amazing and helped them have a better more restful night's sleep. i have worked with autistic kids who have done well with weighted blankets and clothes. but i never thought about it for myself. but i was thinking about giving it a try. has anyone ever used one? it's supposed to calm anxieties. here's part of the description of it: the best anti gravity blanket for people who suffer from ptsd, rls, adhd, anxiety and more: lack of deep sleep can wreak havoc on your life, leaving you irritable, unhappy, and unhealthy. ideal for adults and kids with asperger's, autism, or husband and wives with restless spouses. i feel like it's made for grieving. curious if anyone has any experience with it ps if i'm rambling or repetitive it's because i haven't had any sleep... ironically. or not ironic because my sleeplessness prompted my research. ok i'm done.	❤️
we had to put one of our dogs down tonight the handsome old man had been doing pretty bad. and after a long time of suffering my mom, sister and i made the decision. junior was hands down the most sweet and calm dog we've ever had. i know he's running though doggy heaven in all the snow and eating all the pizza he can. tell me something sweet about your pets please	❤️

should i give up on him? i(20f) have a crush on a boy(23) that i met some time ago in a theatre group. at the beginning he didn't even know i exist, but he needed to borrow a hat for his play, so he wrote a post on facebook and i commented that i can lend it him. then he texted me and we had a nice conversation, but then we haven't been texting for a long time. after play i texted him and congratulated on the play and he responded after few hours. then when i met him at theatre group he only said 'hi' and was telling me that he forgot to take hat that i lend him. a week later, when i was ill i texted him that i wouldn't be on the meeting this day, so he doesn't have to carry the hat with him. then we were texting for a whole day. after all i have no idea if he likes me, i think he doesn't, but i am not sure and i don't know what to do and i don't want to come across as desperate l or miss an opportunity. sorry for my bad english tl;dr i(20f) met a boy(23) and initiated contact with him three times. i have a crush on him. he has never texted first but he has started a short conversation face to face. i should i give up on him?	😂
i graduated today, but i feel kinda bad. when the awards were being read off, i couldn't help but compare myself to the students who received four or five. i know this is an unhealthy attitude and i didn't expect to feel this way. anyway, what was your graduation like and what was life like after graduation? thank you for reading and your insights	😊

gonna get my hair cut soon! what hairstyle should i ask for? so i'm planning on getting my hair cut sometime this weekend and i'm so excited! i've been rocking the long, straight, black hair for the past five years and i've been feeling the need for a change. i honestly think i look like the mom from the addams family with my hair right now lol. not that that's a bad thing, she's absolutely gorgeous, but she's just not the style i'm going for right now i guess? i'm eyeing a long bob right now that should end a little below my collarbone, and styling it every morning when i wake up. i'm open to recommendations though! what hairstyle should i get?	😀

i [18m] think my gf [18f] is talking to other dudes behind my back. [throwaway because she knows of my main account and has one herself.] we've been dating a couple months now and all was going well at the beginning. we felt a real connection, we both said "i love you" to eachother within a couple days of going out. but a couple days ago, i was using her laptop and i saw something i wish i hadn't seen. she had her facebook messenger open in a separate tab and i didn't know what it was so i snooped without thinking. revealing 2 different conversations, one with someone she renamed "my world " and another renamed "my everything". right after i had noticed them she walks in and i immediately close the tab with hesitation. that's when it all kicked off when i questioned her about them, she tried saying they were both ex's and she just didn't delete the conversations whilst snatching the laptop from my hands making sure i wouldn't go back on there. she promised there was nothing going on and that she "deeply loved me" and "wouldn't mess around with anyone else behind my back." i have history with paranoia and anxiety so that's when stuff really hit me hard because i just didn't believe her, at all. i think i knew she was lying because of how the dates were presented on the side bar next to the conversations, they both said "february 12" and "february 14" on them which is really weird because we had been dating a couple months prior to that. she said they were from the year before, which would've been 2018 but the date format was wrong. it would've been 12/02/2018 and 14/02/2018 if it was last year but they weren't. i know this because i checked on my conversations from february 2018 on my messenger. i just really need some advice because my paranoia and anxiety really mess with me sometimes, she knows i've had bad experiences in relationships in the past. when we're out in public, she wants to hold hands and most of the time we do hold but more recently i've been keeping to myself and she doesn't understand why because i won't tell her about what's bothering me. any advice to greatly appreciated. tl;dr: accidentally snooped on my gf's messages, found some "old" messages with her "ex's". she denies. my paranoia is through the roof.	❤️
the kyoto tachibana senior high school marching band is the best [here is a youtube video of one of their performances](<url>) it is absolutely insane to watch high schoolers execute such exacting movements all while play fabulously. i've found them yesterday and i cannot stop watching their videos! if there are any marching band that you believe beat the tachibana marching band, please let me know	😁
i made a breakthrough tonight. so tonight my boyfriend and i had gotten into a bit of an argument that turned out for the better. during the argument he had mentioned that for the past couple of weeks, i had been getting worse despite the fact that we've been generally having less stressers in our lives. i had been saying things like "i hate myself" and being overall nihilistic about my existence a lot more than i usually do and hadn't even realized it. he pleaded "something is wrong and i don't know what! you won't tell me!" i started crying and initially couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. but then it clicked! i had been bothered by a weight loss surgery i've been wanting and haven't been able to afford. as soon as i was able to recognize it, everything spilled out and i told him everything i was feeling. we were able to talk it out and get through it. i'm super proud of myself for being able to recognize the cause for my negative feelings, and for being able to connect them with my actions. i almost always have feelings (positive or negative) but i can't pinpoint what exactly is causing those feelings. it becomes a guessing game and if i don't find the cause, i feel as though the feeling isn't justified. and the lack of justification takes a toll on my self-worth. it's all a vicious cycle. but i'm so glad i was able to break that cycle tonight! i'm so grateful for my boyfriend's love and support as well.	❤️

i miss being a kid. i hate having hair on every inch of my body. sometimes it feels "cool" because it reminds me that i'm growing but other times it just feels disgusting. like, whenever i go to scratch my ass crack the butt hair always gets in the way and makes things feel so uncomfortable. or whenever i try to suck my own dick i just end up with a face full of pubic hair. feels bad man	😢

i (m24) need some serious advice with girlfriend (f23). tl;dr - i am confused with current relationship and wondering if it's something i should continue with due to ongoing issues. before i get into this, there is some stuff you'll need to know. my girlfriend and i have been together twice since 2010. we got together when i was a sophomore in high school and then broke up during my freshman year in college in 2013. to this day i'm still not 100% sure why i broke up with her, but we did have some problems. there was a lot of clingyness going on, a lot of jealousy issues. a lot of snooping around and sneaking into my phone type of stuff. i used to be kind of selfish. i didn't show as much affection as she did. things started to feel old, so i guess i thought it was the best thing to do. during this time, she got with someone else and was with this person until 2016. i tried a few times getting back with her. she ended up cheating on him with me, but still went back to him. i gave up eventually. i moved to a new state and we ended up getting back together after her getting cheated on multiple times and not wanting to deal with it anymore. she moved up here some time after that and we've been living together since. keep in mind we didn't live together for the first 3 years of our relationship. things definitely change living with another person. it's harder. it takes a lot more to keep things on track. things were going good for a while, we weren't arguing much, we enjoyed the new apartment we had. eventually old habits started to come back and i noticed a lot of fighting over small things that eventually became problems. there was always a pattern with her. we'd be good for a little while, maybe about a month, and then things would go bad. i wasn't and aren't always unhappy with her. there are times where i feel content with life, but then something happens and i feel like i just want to leave. i feel like i'd be better off single and not having to deal with it. i'm really confused with how i feel. i used to know. when we weren't together, i spent a lot of time working on myself mentally and physically. i picked up weight lifting and became more physically fit than i've ever been. i've focused on the things i was told was wrong and the things i saw in myself that needed work. i definitely saw a new person within myself and started feeling like i'd be better in a relationship. since we've gotten back together, day by day that clarity was getting hazy. i started losing that sense of understanding within my head. i couldn't understand my feelings at most times or couldn't express my thoughts correctly. its odd. i'm very much attracted to a lot of her qualities. some not so much. as far as body type goes, it's not necessarily ideal but physically she's attractive overall. looks hasn't really ever been a deal breaker for me though. i really usually look beyond that. skip forward to now. a couple nights ago i had a very impacting dream. a dream that made me want to go back. a dream that made my life make more sense than it ever has. i can't recall everything, but of all things i was happy. it was a beautiful day and i was with my girlfriend shopping. weirdly we were returning my christmas gift for something else a little more her taste. the only thing that really got me was that it wasn't my current girlfriend. but it felt completely right in my dream. and in the dream i looked back at my current life and it made me extremely grateful for the life i had in my dream. she was beautiful. she was loving. she enjoyed me. everything about me. i could feel it. with every touch i give her or she gave me, i felt sincerity. i felt love. it was literally out of this world, something i've never felt before and something i feel like i'm never going to feel. every day since that dream, it's all i've been thinking about. i've been hoping that i go back every night. it just gets me thinking that maybe the life i have now isn't enough. maybe i'm not happy and maybe i need a change. but every time i starting thinking that way, i get scared and feel bad. i feel like i'm doing something wrong. i don't know if maybe it's the thought of me leaving my comfort zone, or the lingering guilt i'd feel for ending a relationship. lately i've been considering therapy. i know someone who has a good therapist, according to her. i have to wait until after the holidays when my insurance kicks in. but in the mean time, i feel like reddit is a good place to start with some advice. if you've read this far and have maybe dealt with something similar personally or know someone who has, i would greatly appreciate any words you may have. this is something that's been eating at me for years and i need to fix it as soon as possible. if there is anything else you need to know, i'd be more than happy to answer. i also apologize if things seem scrambled. like i said, i've had a hard time understanding and gathering my thoughts. thanks reddit	😀

helping a lost dog and ruining my apartment 7 years ago i had just moved into an apartment with my girlfriend. i was in a bit of a rut mentally, and on this particular thursday afternoon, i decided to take a different route home, just to change things up. it was a cold rainy day in texas, and as i turn a corner, i see a \~35lb beagle wandering around lost, but he was wearing a collar. i think "this is perfect, i'll do a good deed and change everything around." from here on in, we'll call this new dog "bowser." i pull over, and walk up to the dog who seems friendly. i can't read much on his tags cuz they are dirty, so i put him in my car and drive around the neighborhood. i ask everyone i see if they recognize bowser, but to no avail. so i figure i'll take him home ( i lived less than a mile away from this spot) and call around. i get him home, my current dog smells bowser and goes bananas. turns out, this new dog is covered in fleas. not sure how i missed that before... oops. so i put bowerin the bathroom, leave some water and food, lock the door, and head to the store to get flea shampoo and such. when i get home, bowser meets me at the door...? my current dog is gigantic, and bowser is not, but my dog is petrified of bowser as i walk in. i have no idea why he was scared, but i'm also clueless how bowser got out of the bathroom. welp, i walk over and see that bowser had literally chewed a hole in the bathroom siding/wall and escaped. like i said, bowser is only like 35 lbs, but still, he chewed a 35 lb dog size hole in the freaking wall. so, i take the dogs out, shampoo them both, throw them in the car and head to the store for a flea bomb fogger thing, because the fleas are everywhere in the apt. of course while heading to the store, this is when my girlfriend arrives home, to see a giant hole in the wall, and she thinks our dog is missing. she panics, and calls me, and i have to try and explain everything that just happened, plus give her the bonus news of "we're gunna have to flea bomb the apartment." i am killing it right now. get the dogs cleaned up, flea bomb the apartment and we all leave to go to a dog park cuz we gotta kill some time. side note, when i removed bowsers collar to clean him up, i realized its so tight on his neck it has literally rubbed the fur off and has left a permanent indentation where the buckle is on his neck. this dog has not been cared for well at all. while at the park we scrub bowsers dog tags and find a phone number. i call the owner, she speaks very little english but she does say "i need him back, he's my lucky man." i ask what that means, and after an excruciating conversation, we find out bowser is being used as a breeder and this woman does not have a license... so, we debate calling the cops, or animal control, or something, but coincidentally, my buddy had been saying he wants a dog. i call my friend and he takes the dog to the vet, gets it updated on years of missing shots, names it bowser and gets a new best friend for life. meanwhile, i get to fix a hole in the wall this weekend, clorox wipe literally everything in my apartment and scour my car for fleas. tldr: helped a lost dog, he chewed a hole in my apartment wall, gave everyone fleas, i discovered an illegal dog breeding ring, and pissed off my girlfriend, though she eventually understood. no good deed goes unpunished fun fact: my buddy still has ol' bowser to this day, 7 years later.	😊

how do you identify a hustler? there are multiple ways to identify a hustler, and maybe not every of the ones listed here is obvious, but it still helps to know what you should look out for if youre trying to know if someone is a hustler. - if he is barely replying to your messages because he doesnt have time for unneccessary social stuff - if he randomly wakes you up at 3am and screams: ,,get up and work!" at you - if he occasionally runs through the living room, always repeating the words ,,hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle" pretty loud - if he sometimes says or replies to you with ,,i am working too hard " - if he ends everything with ,,represent", ,,g" or ,,hustle 247" i hope this can help yall! represent, g! hustle 247	😩
i feel no matter how hard i try, he's just not happy. throwaway account since he knows my other one . boyfriend(28) and i(23) have been dating a little over a year. everything was going great until recently. it was okay until it wasn't. i have every quality he supposedly looks for in a woman and i do my best to try to do things each day to make his life easier. he never actually appreciates it anymore and just notices the things i don't do. i don't hear about anything that's bothering him about us until i basically pry it out of him. i get that he's stressed out about money, new job, family, etc but i don't think it should be taken out on me especially since he refuses to talk about the issues. it's seeming more and more like this will just lead toxic but a few people say i'm over-reacting. help :( tldr: i may be in a relationship that's going toxic and i'm not sure?	❤️

omg help wtf there is something wrong with meeeee ok so i have a problem. a huge problem. i'm a sophomore in high school and in my entire life i have had 2 crushes. the first one was in 7th grade i liked this boy a lot and we started talking. a few weeks went by, then there was a party. at this party, he said he needed to talk to me, so i was like "ummmmm ok" and basically he asked me out. the second he did, my interest in him died completely. my second crush started in 8th grade. we never talked that much but i rly rly rly liked him all the way through to 10th grade (now). since the beginning of the school year we have become pretty good friends. now it's the autumn break at my school in denmark so we haven't seen each other for a while. as a result, we have gotten to texting almost everyday. i've had a creeping suspicion that he likes me bc i catch him staring at me in class, and bc he's almost always the one who texts first. about 4 days ago, he brought up crushes. he was teasing me about liking a senior, which i obviously don't bc i like him. sooooo i tried to get him to stop talking about that by saying he loves this girl in our class, and he was like "no..." and then i suggested it was another person and he says no to that too. he admits to having a crush on a girl in our class, and there are only 4 of us (ik there are sooo few girls and so many boys in our grade). i knew where he was going with this bc the only other girl who i hadn't mentioned except for me is openly gay. at this i freaked out and said i had to go play super smash bros with my brother. this was btw a total lie bc i'm the only one who likes that game my bro hates it. so end of story now i don't like my crush anymore. send help i'm fucking broken this is not normal human behaviour	😭
i got a perm i got a perm because i have long very straight hair and i wanted some body and texture to it. no one has commented on it, which makes me think that people don't like it. but i love it. so that's all that matters.	😊
saw the cutest guy today and when to harrods this saturday before midday (low-key hinting at anyone who knows a friend that works there at that time haha) and one of the staff there was absolutely beautiful. not going to lie--i lingered a bit on the floor he was on to get a look. isn't it so funny how we see people we find attractive but will never see them again? and they'll never know we had a fleeting thought about them? life tell me about the cute people you saw today or any day matter of fact.	😏
goodnight everyone love u all	❤️

pretty sure friend is copying me to be cool i'm a sophmore, and during freshman year i met a kid who was kind of a loner, i brought him into our group which i pretty much run. he's pretty edgy and a lot of people don't like him, but over the summer he just changed. he started wearing the same clothes as me, started styling his hair like mine, dyed it like mine, etc.. he even said he loved my jacket and bought the same one online and sowed on the same patch. once he realizes everyone likes one of my new jokes he starts saying them too. it's pretty weird and while i know that some people just want a good friend i hate being the same as anybody else. how do i tell him to stop if he just denies it relentlessly? edit: he also gets this power surge when i'm gone, i was suspended for 2 months last year and he tried to grab my girls ass because he thought he could fill the void that was made while i was gone i've also been in germany for a week now and everyone in our group has seen him hit an all time high for rage since i've left	😂

uhh.... this is fine. (insert flaming surroundings here) my (m38) wf (f35) sister (f26) moved in with us. we've never had a chance to really get to know each other over the years until these last few months. we've had similar life experiences and relate to each other very well. i realized now that i've fallen in love with her and there's nothing i can do about it but suffer. it's awesome to feel like you're dying inside everyday. tl;dr i'm dying inside	😐
just had the worst toe stub in my life i wasnt running but walking fast and i stubbed my toe. its totally blue and hurts so much	😭
trying to be an ecofriendly white girl. i'm addicted to the starbucks frappuccino's, the ones you can get in stores in the glass jars. i know not many agree, but the sugary, light taste of it is nice since warmer weather is on its way. i hate that i'm like this. throwing them away seems wasteful and bad for the environment. recycling isn't great in my area. ive decided i want to repurpose them in whatever way i can. they'd be cute as cups, since they were designed to hold liquid, but do you guys think they'd be nice kitchenware? they're large enough to hold things like loose candy, sugar, maybe a bit of rice. or maybe they could be used as something else... any creative ideas?	😂

tension between my (21m) older sister (22f) and my father (54m) is spilling into the entire family this timeline is a little tricky, even for me, so if there are any questions, i'll happily answer to the best of my ability. this is also a goddamn epic, so the tl;dr is a little long, but i can't imagine anyone has enough patience for the whole dilemma if i barely do. so there's a lot of history with my dad. he is a recovering addict, at least a year or two sober from harder drugs and 6mo sober from alcohol. he was an addict since he was my age. as a result, he wasn't a good father or even a good guy sometimes. he's always had good intentions, but before he went into a rehab center and took it seriously, it was just a way to get us on his side while my parents were separated, divorced after he left rehab. he used selling drugs to get us out of binds, but before the separation, that meant taking things from the house to sell and disappearing for days. even as a toddler, i remember being at my grandparents with my older sister (i'll call her rose) for at least a week at a time every other week because both of my parents were addicts until my little sister (19f) was born, more on that later. after my mom (43f) had enough of his using drugs, she left him. she had a really dodgy relationship after that and lost her job because the relationship was another addict and a client under her, but she was free from my dad. i wasnt, and neither was rose. when mom lost her job and stayed with the ex-client, she had to move to a neighboring town, with a new school district, so i stayed with my father to stay in the school i was already in. his addiction and depression worsened exponentially as time went on after the separation. he lost his job, then the house, then friends that didn't use. rose and i had to bounce around houses with him for awhile, which was exhausting and i can't even get the timeline straight almost a decade later because it was so sporadic. at the very worst of the addiction, we moved to the same town but court and custody made moving with my mom complicated. this was around the time rose harbored huge resentment towards my mother for being physically abusive to her and, because rose can't let go of a grudge, because my mother wouldn't give her every little thing she wanted. she was getting to the age where she wanted to have underage parties more and more, so she essentially lied to my father that mom was abusing her again, and he took her in and allowed her to throw massive parties in the new house, that way he could use drugs in a social setting as a justification. rose got to the point of drinking where she would drink alone daily, even bringing alcohol to school. she wasn't allowed to walk at graduation because she showed up to the breakfast and rehearsal drunk, and was lucky the school didn't press charges. his using got to the point where he was experimenting with drugs other than crack/cocaine, his poison of choice, specifically selling and using bath salts. i was so enamored with him at the time that i even encouraged his enthusiasm towards dealing bath salts, and had no problem with how invasive he was in our rooms or our privacy that i slept on the couch in the living room because i knew he wouldn't use drugs in the living room and (a justification at the time) because i saw and related witb his depression at the time (signs of depression and suicidal ideations for me at as early as 5, recently diagnosed with bipolar 2). he went to jail, and he tells me it was because rose's friends left empty ecstasy packets around the house, rose says it wasn't her fault and that it was dad using. neither party are very reliable at this point in the story, though. to backtrack a little, my older sister and i used to be much closer. in fact, i barely bonded with my younger sister, amanda for all intents and purposes, until shortly before the separation, when i started seeing less of amanda when she moved in with my mother and i stayed with dad. one of the big reasons i stayed with my dad was to stay with rose. i took after her partying way earlier than i would have liked to, but i also wasn't ever really into the partying scene or drinking all that much, although i did it to feel normal. rose was my protector. we took care of each other. my mom targeted rose as a child, and my dad targeted me, calling me names like faggot and verbally dismissing me as my grandfather's (72m) son. he ridiculed me for not being masculine enough at so young, and even though it was because he had to take care of his drunken father as a child, i know now that that isn't an excuse. rose knew we both needed help in a way that only one another could understand, and then she eventually started taking advantage of that, usually by making me do chores for her simply because i was doing something and she didn't want to. my father went to jail and fleed arrest to make sure rent was taken care of, so he served 6mo in jail. rose drove me to visit him. we lost the house he was renting because he allowed an illegal tenant and fellow bath salts user to squat, even though our landlord only knew about rose and i. when he got out, rose lived in an apt with a friend and i was back in my mom's house with amanda, taking turns sleeping in amanda's room or the living room with amanda. when he got out, my father floated around for a while, and then he stole my older sister's car for a "job interview" a couple hours out of town in the city, where we knew he got his supply. the interview must have taken place in rose's car with a clepto raccoon, because things were missing from the dash, glove compartment, and backseat, and the interior was destroyed. it was clear he relapsed and was living in her car for a week. despite all this, my sister moved back in with him when he found a new place so she could continue having large parties, and i followed. he moved to a city closeby after rent fell through, but the opposite direction from supply city, and nearly committed suicide before he was sent to a rehabilitation program for a year in a city two hours in the opposite direction of the supply city, which was good, but visiting only got trickier from there. it was my senior year at this point, so he missed my graduation, but i wanted him to stop using. i was proud of him despite everything and was honestly okay with his absence. he was released from the rehab program after doing really well. he hadn't used anything in an environment where it wasn't super hard to sneak in drugs and use. the program found him work and employment in the city with other sober addicts for support. he was there for at least two years before he decided to come back, and i was halfway through my sophomore year at college. now the tables of the bad guy absolutely explodes in the opposite direction. rose had found a new place out of town with a boyfriend, and when my father came back, she let him stay with her. she was still drinking a lot, so it wasnt a great environment for him. she experienced a breakup, and quickly relapsed to her current boyfriend. i was living with my mother and amanda in a new place with my own room when i wasn't at college, so amanda and i basically became best friends if not better than best friends. when rose moved on from the last boyfriend, they moved into a trailer in the middle of nowhere. my dad is scared of rural areas like the one she was in. rose took that fear as though it was him covering up a drug relapse, when it clearly was not. he found another place (i can't remember where) and found a new job before moving where he is now. here's where i am now: my father is not enjoying where he lives because of drama that his roommate and workmate brings home from work. it's essentially a boarding house, so i'm not usually allowed to come over without a couple weeks advance of notice or more, and sometimes the landlord changes his mind at the last minute. i've taken a break from college due to my mental health declining from the stress of too many responsibilities. i had to move in with my grandfather over the summer because my mother moved in with a different man (now her husband, but over the summer i moved out was just her boyriend of a year or so) and he was struggling to make ends meet after my grandma passed. amanda went with my mom in the only other available bedroom. amanda learned to hate the college she enrolled in and especially hated the isolation of my mother's new house and the new alcoholic in the family, my mother's husband, who even if amanda wouldn't move in with them, i couldn't because my mother's husband gets drunk and targets me physically. when i left college, i felt increasingly isolated. it was hard for me to visit friends at college, even though the campus is close, because i'm scared of driving, so i rely on my grandpa for rides out of the middle of nowhere. my father is healthier than he has ever been mentally, but his past drug use has massively complicated his physical health to the point where he's beem diagnosed with cancer for the second time. him, amanda and i all need a space in town where we can thrive and have a better support for one another (which is backwards in terms of me and amanda taking care of my dad, but for his physical and mental reasons, i'll manage). him and i have plans to make music together. amanda and i want to try our hands at youtube. amanda needs a place where she can see her friends from home and her boyfriend. it only makes sense that we move in together. however, rose won't have it. her boyfriend (?m) we'll call riley is really nice, but pretty controversial as a whole. he got into a confrontation with my dad while my dad was sober and riley was drunk in front of riley's whole family. apparently, rose had been badmouthing my father increasingly despite him being sober since he moved back near us. she has every right to be upset, but she's downright hateful in general. when amanda was being bullied by a friendship gone sour at her high school, rose messaged the bully and called her racial slurs and made racial threats at the friend because she was black. rose had black friends. rose dated a black guy in high school. riley, however, is incredibly conservative. to me, the picture of him pushing her to an intensely hateful state of mind (not to say conservatives are bad but rather radical anything is bad) is incredibly clear. rose demands money from him to help her with car payments that she is almost a year in total behind on, which my grandfather's credit is suffering for as the co-signer on the loan. rose demands he pays for her cell phone. all the while, she calls him a scumbag and a piece of shit. and if he doesn't do as she asks, he's even less to her. the tension between riley and my father is so high because of my sister's newfound mistrust and cruel hatred to so many people that he often says how much he wish riley were dead to me in private. this sunday, my mother had a late easter dinner/celebration because she was working easter at her old job, celebrating because she has a new job as a child protection service worker. dish to pass, tension between amanda and rose increased because of the way rose treats dad, calls him by his first name, and because dad only showed to amanda's graduation (again, rose didn't walk, and i'm fine with the fact that he couldn't make it to mine), but they were pretty much docile to one another. then, when we all sat down to eat, it came up that amanda and i were moving in with dad. rose said "you guys better have locks on your doors. although [dad's first name] will probably just break the lock and use in your room anyway. scumbag piece of shit yada yada yada" and the topic went away for awhile. rose brought dad up again, unprecedented. she was pretty much baiting for a response. amanda got mad when rose said "if i find out there are any n****rs at the house, ill call the cops. and i will find out (she lives in supply town now so she's bluffing but it's still not appropriate at a family dinner, let alone as a white human that exists in general)." and they both blew up on each other at the table. rose stormed out with riley, who politely apologized and followed behind her. he seemed really tired of her hatefulness, too, but i might be projecting. amanda broke down. after a while, the dust settled. my dad is really struggling to cut her off. her attitude towards him turned him to shutting her out of our phone plan because he couldn't pay the whole phone bill last month and asked for a small part of the bill. i get text notifications from the phone company, so i can verify this was his intention. her hateful attitude isn't just exhausting. it's scary. both amanda and i have friends who are poc. amanda has no problem not talking to rose, and vice versa. i try to play the middle man between rose and dad and tried to convince dad not to shut her off, but we agreed it was for his sanity. she called me about being shut off from the phone plan calling him a piece of shit, even though she said she'd just get her own plan. i was with friends, so i didn't want to talk about family drama on the phone. then she messaged me. i copied the conversation to not paraphrase too much. i'm m, she's r. r: don't contact me if you're gonna stick up for that pos i don't need this stress in my life new number! i will turn on my own services and he can go fuck himself m: i've tried my damnedest to play the middle man for you two and it's exhausting because you're exactly alike. i don't know how you can be so rude and still expect anything from him. you want stuff from him? ask him for stuff. you want to hate him? then cut him off. i've had it with both of you at this point. you can't treat anyone like shit and expect them to provide for you. that's toxic, manipulative, and abusive at the very least. he's been awful, but there's a better way for you to cope with the bullshit you've been through (and i've said to him millions of times that it's been alot) without expecting things from someone you also essentially hate and have no respect for. you can't eat your cake and spit in it too. you want to stop talking to me? then you can block me. i'm trying so hard to be the bigger person in all of this m: you can be mad at him and still ask him for stuff, just not with the immense disrespect you continue to show r: lol literally pathetic i have my own phone. you have no idea who he is and what he's put me through! so don't say shit! i have my own line nd i do t need him. tell him to leave [riley] out of this cause it's between me and him not [riley]. k thanks m: i've defended you so much lol m: you think i don't know shit when i literally lived with you through all of his shit. and then you can say he stole your car and your money and pretend i don't know. how am i not supposed to know? you won't shut up about it. you refuse to get over it. r: ya well you wouldn't either if you worked for it. be a little understanding or don't! i'm fine if i don't speak with you or [amanda] trust me (girl shrugging emoji) m: you're only hearing what you want to hear! i'm telling you i understand the anger. that's not an excuse to be toxic asf r: to him? yeah it is and you won't tell me otherwise m: alright w/e. you can't be the bigger person, whatever. i begged him not to shut your phone off bc i know you're so close minded that you'd just bitch and forget all he's done to try amd recover from his stupidity, and endlessly tried to apologize. m: he's taken just as much from me. mentally, i have nothimg because of him. so get tf off your victim pedestal, learn to take responsibility for things, and come back to the reality that the world doesn't revolve around you and other people have suffered for lots of shit and haven't been so blind to see that he's trying to change. lemme know when you get there m: and i've got all the room to talk, cuz i'm a piece of shit who's also trying to stop being a piece of shit, so don't even begin to tell me that he can't. if i can, anyone can as long as they want to. he wants to r: good for you. bye douche bag m: great comeback lol r: i don't have anything nice to say and i don't want you to go kill yourself so yep douche bag fits i feel like i might have been a bit intense in this conversation, but the racial hate speech, the financial irresponsibility, disregard for my grandfather who raised us when my parents wouldn't, and finally and most importantly, the lack of the ability to forgive anyone but especially my father, the obsession to belittle him every opportunity she can, and her blindness to her toxicity has a built up to a point that i can't take any more, and i've been told i have the patience of a saint. tl;dr time dad was a bad guy for my childhood. all of it. abusive, manipulative, and very sick with addiction. i got most of my childhood from other family members, especially my grandpa and my older sister. mom stopped addiction after my little sister was born, and left my dad a while later due to his addiction. my older sister took advantage of my dad's alcoholism and worsening addiction so she could throw high school parties. i understood and sympathized with my dads depression, but i never gained a relationship with him until he came back to town from rehab. between jail for drugs and rehab, he stole my older sister's car and relapsed. i'm on medical leave from college, living with my grandpa to take care of him and because there was no room for me at my mom's new place. my little sister is my best friend, and she hates living with my mom's husband in the middle of nowhere. my father is 2 years sober from hard drugs and 6mo sober of alcohol, feeling lonely, and scared of his cancer. little sister, father and i want to move in together in town. my older sister is holding a grudge above my dad's head to use him for bills and a phone plan. he cant take the disrespect anymore. she takes every opportunity she can to belittle him. she is with a radically conservative boyfriend and uses hate speech against black people, threatens that if she finds out black people are at our future apartment together, she's calling the cops. little sister and i have black friends, so this is scary, and my last paragraph describes my attitude towards older sister. i don't know what to even ask. should i cut off rose, my older sister? if i do, does that put me at risk of her brigading our house with police? how do we escape the manipulative nature of it all when she affects my grandpa so heavily and is at every family gathering on my mom's side (kinda)? is there a way i can repair my relationship with rose, who used to be my best friend before my younger sister and i were? there's just a lot of stuff that i don't know how to handle and i've talked about it in counseling but it's always changing and it's hard for a counselor to keep up with stuff like this.	😂
teenage years are your best years, they said. you'll have fun, they said. spend it wisely, they said. so far, this ain't nothing like the movies. flipping hollywood and their lies smh. i'm still single for example, but in the movies they end up with a nice and wholesome girl. why cant it be like that	😭
i've always wanted to dance but i can't dance to save my life i think people that can dance are so cool lol, i especially love hip hop and bboy style dancing and watching choreo videos on youtube always makes me fantasize about what it would be like. girls that can dance are so sexy, guys that can dance are dripping with swag, plus a huge part of hip hop dancing is fashion, which also happens to be a huge part of my life lol. for now though i'm stuck with my daydreams of what it would be like to kill a choreo and have a crowd of my dance classmates go nuts	😅

how do i (23f) get over the pain of a friendship? it feels like the pain of a heartbreak if not worse i (23f) recently graduated college, and i'm learning how to deal with friendships ending. i have two friendships in particular that are hard for me. the most important one is my friend, let's call him joey (24m). joey has been one of my good friends since freshman year of college and recently moved to colorado this summer. i got a job out there too, and just moved here last week. i visited in the summer, and things were great. then all of a sudden he started being distant and aloof. now i'm actually living 20 minutes from him and he hasn't asked me any questions about my move or done anything any decent human would do when someone moves to a new city. i've invited him to dinner twice (once last week, and once this week) and both times i get a very noncommittal answer. i know this friendship is probably ending (probably because of his girlfriend that just moved in w him), and i need to learn how to accept it. it would make me feel really good to just tell him off and tell him he's being a dick, but i'm also thinking what if he has something else going on?? anyway, kind of ranting but what are people supposed to do in these kinds of situations? i have no family out here, and i'm just starting to make friends, but it's been pretty lonely. it makes it even worse knowing i have a good friend here that doesn't even want to see me. advice!? what do you do when you can feel yourself losing a friend?? tl;dr: moved to a new city, and longtime friend has been avoiding me.	😢

reasons why i hate tik tok 1- aside from a few gems most of the people on there are cringey 12 year olds with self diagnosed anxiety and/or depression who use the black and white filters on everything to show how sad they are 2- once a girl was singing i just did a bad thing and i was like oh you listen to bill wurtz cool i love his music and she was like lol who's that i know it from tik tok and i got embarrassed 3- it's respawned 2012 "i'm not like other girls" culture but instead of homestuck and emo bands it's rex orange county day and billie eyelash 4- varlie. need i day more 5- creepy ass old neckbeards 6- it's spawned those people who think it's hot to dress up like a little kid and roleplay pedophilia like bruh that's some reasons why i hate tik tok don't forget to like comment and subscribe to my channel for more epic gamer content. tap the bell icon if you want to be notified every time i post a new epic minecraft video. bye guys	😎

hi everyone! tell me how your day's going :) so far, its been fine. i finally finished an 80 played matches contract in cod (at 2 am so it counts as today ), i got a new pair of heels, scored top 10 on my 2nd match ever in fortnite then rage quit the next match, and now i'm eating cereal, woo! anyway, how way your day redditors? talk to me about/ask me about anything you like :)	😂
ow my feelings my boyfriend has spent literally 8 god damn hours playing overwatch, but he "doesn't have time" to talk to me for a little bit because of "school" i'm totally not lonely or anything he definitely doesn't go days without talking to me at all.	😎
my (17f) boyfriend's (19m) parents don't like me because of my age and it's pissing me off my boyfriend and i have been dating for a little over 5 months. we have an absolutely amazing relationship. he is very sweet, romantic, and he loves and cares about me a lot and he is a great boyfriend. i love him so much, he's the first guy to ever treat me right, and i care about him with all my heart. his parents, on the other hand, have some sort of issue with me because they think i'm "underage". which, yes, i am not 18 yet while their son is over 18, but that doesn't make it "illegal" for us to date (they think it is). in my state, the legal age of consent is 16 anyways. and we haven't even had sex yet. also, he's not even 2 years older than me. his parents met in high school and his dad is 3 years older than his mom, so this is just a s***load of hypocrisy. our age has been a problem with his family, specifically his dad, since we started dating. he has recently opened up to me about his family life and let's just say it is not good at all. his parents shit on him constantly and they have his whole life. he has had a lot of stress lately and he says i am the only person who he feels like he can be himself with, which, seeing the way he acts around others and the way he acts around me, it seems to be true. his dad seems like a mega asshole with intense anger issues and one of his rants is apparently the fact that i'm too young for his son. the main thing that made me want to write this post was i was just over at his new house tonight to watch the game and honestly nothing seemed off. his dad was nice to me and his mom is super sweet and i'm pretty sure she likes me? but they have very strange rules and get angry over minuscule things. i wasn't sitting all the way on the sofa because i thought i had to get up for something, and his mom told me to "sit my ass back in the chair". she said this quietly, plus my boyfriend was busy watching the super bowl so he didn't hear what she said. i thought it was super weird that she got upset over that, she didn't really have to tell me that. i don't see why she did, i just thought i had to get up for something. i also thought that she really liked me prior to what happened tonight, she's always super nice to me and very sweet. i don't know how to tell my boyfriend this or if i should? he feels bad enough about the way his family feels about me. the only family member who 100% seems to like me is his younger brother who is 15. his sister apparently is also weirded out by my age but she's pretty nice to me in person. i'm always really polite around his family and try to be myself (minus swearing and such...lmao). i honestly think the real/"deep-down" reason why his dad doesn't like me is because i make his son happy, because that's how negative people are, they want everyone to be unhappy like them. i really don't know how to go about this, i know i can't "make" his parents like me. it just makes me feel bad/insecure about myself. im a good person and i love my boyfriend more than anything, and they have no reason to not like me. and i kinda don't want to tell him about what his mom said tonight because he'll feel bad that she made me upset. he hates when i'm upset, especially if he thinks it's his fault. anyways, any advice for what i should do about what she said to me tonight and if i should tell my bf would be appreciated tl;dr boyfriend's parents (specifically dad) think our age is a problem. his mom said something super rude to me tonight, even though i thought she liked me? not sure what to do and kinda feeling bad about myself, since they dislike me for pretty much no reason.	😅
its's my birthday but... it's also the first day of my exams	😭
ex? long post so, this whole thing has been weighing pretty heavy on me recently and its been a big part of my life for a few years. its this girl of course. i'm 19 (m), she is 20. we started having a relationship almost two years ago at this point and it started out wonderful, she turned out to be my first real girlfriend and we both fell head over heals hard. we both have a lot of issues to ourselves, but im the type of guy who likes to work through problems and try and come out the other side better. she is a free spirit who does't know what she wants in life, but she's got a ton of energy and loves to do. or relationship started to get a bit rockey and she ended up breaking up with me. fast forward a month or so and she wants to get back together because she realized she made a mistake and we ended up getting back together. after that, she broke up with me a few more times claiming she needed to fix herself before she could come back to our relationship. what happened was that our relationship became toxic for a few different reasons, and she wanted to get out of it. and so did it. i consider myself an empath (someone who feels emotion more, has a heavier effect on me. aka someone is in a bad mood i can end up actually absorbing that energy and be in a bad mood myself) so many of the times she would be unhappy, our poor communication would lead to me picking up on her negative energy and mainly the poor communication would intensify the problem. i'm not blaming her for the negative energy, i didn't help the situation most of the time, but i always wanted to work through it and love her. we've been broken up since about june this past year after breaking up and getting back together almost every month since the first time we broke up. and i guess i broke the cycle this last time. she came to me over the summer after breaking up with me. (she felt like she wasnt able to be the best her for the relationship. and this one upset me because i told her i was scared to get back with her again because i thought she might randomly breakup again. and then she did...) so over the summer, she goes to a music festival and tries to get ahold of me to fix things, and my frustration and anger took control and i basically told her off for breaking my heart. then she gets into a relationship with a guy she met there, then fast forward to september. i don't know what got into me, but feeling of being betrayed for months and heartbroken changed and i decided to get ahold of her to see how she was and to apologize for all of my negativity. which is one of my flaws i've been working on for my whole life and im still working on. i think she is a part of that process. i almost think that if i can make things right with her, that i can solve my other frustrations, if that makes any sense. so i apologize and she starts telling me how her relationship hasnt been going amazingly and that she has been waiting for me to get back to her, and that she basically misses me. of course this is good news to me because i want to be with her and love her, and shes showing that to me as well. so we jokingly set up a date she is gong to come visit me, which happened to be the next day, and she comes through. we went on a date had some great laughs and whatnot, and then she comes back to my dorm where you can guess what happened. i thought i was in heaven lol. she still hasn't found anyone that she likes better in bed. same for me, which is sorta important. and then she leaves the next day and says "ill get back to you on if we are going to be a thing" after that, she went back to her boyfriend and decided to stay even though she said they werent matching well. so, i get super emotional because that really fucking sucked (no anger, working on it lol) and she basically stopped texting me as her answer of who she picked. should be over it right? get over her, get a new gf, move on, ect... and that's what i did. i found a girl who i found interesting and that went well for a few months. that girl and i ran into our own problems different to this other girl and i's, but i ended up breaking things off with her. but before we broke up (she cheated) i texted girl #1 out of curiosity. there's just something about this girl and i don't get it. there's no logical reason i can justify our relationship because of what happened between us. the goods were unreal, and the bad was really shitty for both of us, but here i am still feeling for her. but anyways, i started texting her again to kinda find out if she made the right decision, and after a few days of taking on and off, she told me that she's super depressed with this guy and is getting frustrated with him. "i'm holding on to the little faith i have left" and "he doesnt get my jokes and it chips at my faith" are some quotes from her. so, the new girl and i break up and i continue to talk to the first girl as christmas time starts rolling around. after christmas, we've talked to each other every single day. sometimes the convo turns into talking about sex because we both miss it with each other, other times its talking about dreams that the other person is in, sometimes its her complaining about her bf. after we started talking about sex more and more, i finally asked her what we are doing. she says she doesn't know and that it makes her happy to talk to me and that her bf knows and hes okay with it only because it makes her happy. so i ask, "should we really be talking?" shes admitted that i learned her as a lover and not a friend, so i feel that its wrong for her to have a bf and still talk to me. wrong because the dude is sorta being cheated on, and also wrong because i also want to be with her but im not able to. her response was "i need to think about this" and the next day we continued to talk like normal. fast forward a week or two and were still having convos about hot dreams and sex in general, and its like i fall in love more each day even though maybe i shouldn't. and she still hasnt given me an answer, but this whole thing has been on my mind 24 7 for weeks and its driving me up a wall. last night i told her we need to talk about it (even through text cause its hard to get ahold of her.) so i started telling her everything on my mind about wanting to be with her, and asking her why she's taking to both of us and i said this, " i know you don't know what you want to do, but at somepoint you have to make a decision because it effects me too. sometimes you gotta make hard choices, and you can't avoid making one here no matter which way you go. you know why i'm messaging you and what decision i've made at this point. i need your response" to which she replied "i need some time to think about this" should i be doing this? is it worth it? am i in the wrong? what should i do? im going insane and i need your guys' help	😔

he won't tell me he loves me. tl:dr; boyfriend of over a year won't tell me he loves me. my boyfriend (34m) and i (30f) have been together for about 15 months. we got serious pretty quickly. moved in together about 7 months in. everything's great. we communicate well. never argue. have talked about and dealt with some pretty serious issues we both admittedly have. we both have lost both of our parents by a pretty young age and are both only children. he treats me like a princess, very chivalrous and a perfect gentleman and i think he's so smart and charming. overall very happy in our relationship, however, he will not tell me he loves me. i felt i loved him within a few months and i thought he'd follow eventually, yet, here we are, 15 months in and no "i love you" from him. he certainly acts like he loves me. what gives? i've asked him so many times why he can't say it and he always asks me what it feels like to be in love, but i can't really describe it. i just feel like it's something you just know. has anyone dealt with this? it's not a deal breaker but one of my love languages is definitely words of affirmation and it's hard for me not to hear it. i don't even really tell him i love him anymore because i can't stand to hear him reply with "awww, thanks" or "you're so sweet" anymore. help! has anyone else dealt with this?	😐
freshly out of a relationship, but in love with a friend. i hope people can help me process my feelings. i'm a week out of my long term relationship, and i've made peace with that decision. however i(m26) find myself thinking about a friend (f23) romantically, and often. she was a factor into why i broke up with my ex. her cheerful demeanor and attitude was a stark contrast to my ex, which helped me realize i wasn't in a healthy relationship, and that i had been unhappy for a long time. we have also shared some quiet looks and prolonged eye contact, typically while we're drinking together so i tried my best to distance myself, since i was still in a relationship at the time. i'm trying to process if what i'm feeling is genuine love, or an emotional knee-jerk reaction, or something else i haven't considered. i tend towards sociopathic(?) , so i don't normally feel strong emotions of any kind. with that in mind, i'm unsure if my feelings are the correct ones, and would appreciate any advice, or guidance on the matter. tl;dr i want to know if my attraction to my friend is legitimate, or just a knee-jerk reaction to having recently broken up. thank you in advance	😊
how do i get rid of the "scars" i'm a teen and like every other teen i have pimples, but i end up scratching mine . and i recently noticed that when i scratch a pimple it'll scar in to a super dark dot, that doesn't go away forever, literally. like is this normal or am i not getting enough of a certain vitamin, i'm really active, as i take part of sports team at school and outside, and go to the gym everyday. so does anyone know what i could do about this?	😐

am i (27f) involving social media too much into me and my bf (32m) relationship? me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 months now. he's amazing all around the board, and actually the first relationship that i've been in that hasn't been toxic. my last relationship (i've only been in 4 serious all abusive this was by far the worst though) my ex was always on fb or ig liking girls pictures saying the women were his "friends"... fast forward he was messaging them inappropriately and cheated on me several times this has caused major self issues and i tend to question everyone's motives. i have nothing against social media. it's a platform to like things, share things, promote, whatever. but i'm not big on it either, i can care less for it, reddit is honestly the one i'm on the most because i don't.know.a.single.person. less drama/problems. anyways, my thing is when you like one persons pictures constantly (seriously like every single post), and it's with multiple women.( i feel like that gives off the intention of you liking them. this is common sense for millennials, am i right ?) this is what my current boyfriend has done. and i've called him out on it. it's been with about 5 different girls where he likes all of their things back to back. we met through facebook, and the whole situation makes me feel a little insecure and suspicious just because of things i've already been through and i'm not trying to/going to allow to repeat. we took our first picture and it came out really cute, and i posted it just to let people know i'm not single anymore (men dm me all the time, as i'm pretty sure this happens with most women) so i asked if he would do the same. im not asking to make a grand gesture because i feel like people do over share but being subtle (like 1 picture!!) i think is ok. he said he didn't like how he looked in the picture, but when we take another one he'll post it. 2 days later it's his best friends birthday, and he posts a pic of them at the gym and he looks like a rabid animal. obviously i got offended. am i looking to deep into things being immature and annoying and even worse am i now being the toxic one or are my suspicions valid ? tldr ; social media is starting to change my perception on my boyfriend because he doesn't post that he's no longer single, but is consistently like a select few of women's posts. am i crazy and paranoid or do i have a point ?	😩
which majors give you the most options for job opportunities. i'm kinda scared for my future after high school sorry guys! long post i'm going to be a junior in high school in a couple months. this is going to be a big year and i've tried to suppress the idea that i'll have to think about my future but it's time i do it. i still don't know where i'd like to go college but my family is pretty financially stable so there's options. i making this post because i'm torn between choices. i've wanted to do med school since i was a little kid, i know that i'll never really have to worry about finding a job since there are hospitals and clinics everywhere, and the wages are really promising. i'm questioning it because i don't know if i have the smarts to make it in that field. also from what i hear, you basically sign away your early twenties. buisness is a little generic i think because it's so popular. i'm sort of considering it as a fallback plan, but i'm interested in management as well. these are sort of what i had in mind, but as you can tell i don't know anything about college majors and what you can get out of them. advice is welcomed!!	🙃
tommorow i turn 20 tomorrow i turn 20 and i am going to stop participating in r/teenagers. i am still going to be in here i'm just not going to comment or post. i just want to say that i am so thankful that in the last 1 1/2 years on reddit that you all have truly made it special for me. i have been able to laugh with you, i have cried along with you who have lost someone close and there isn't another sub like it. i have never felt so close to others when i was going through a difficult time or when others needed help. i'm currently in my sophomore year of college and i'm struggling so in these past few days every post has been helping me. you guys and gals truly mean the world to me and i really don't want to stop participating and interacting with you all. although i never really posted here just reading your stories would brighten up my day more than anything else. i'm making this as a farewell so i can talk with all of you one last time before i go. i love you all and i hope that life is good to you all because it will only get more difficult as we go on but it is important now that you all have each other. thank you all	❤️

not cleaning the sink then texting my boss at a late time this fuck up happened earlier today. (on mobile so sorry in advance) my boss, let's call him sam, is not loved within our work place. he loves to micromanage and do everything his way, even if this way is wrong or not efficient. sam is the owner of the business witch is a dairy/coffee shop/take away shop. we are fairly isolated from town but it's in a largeish community so good business. anyway, earlier tonight we were packing up and i was washing the dishes. i've been working here for a while so i definitely know how to wash dishes. i had to wash out the container that we use to batter things in. this container has lots of batter caked onto the sides and top of it, so it's a bit of a chore to wash. when i was done i forgot to clean the sink out so there were bits of wet batter lumps on the bottom of the sink. my ride was here so i had to leave. this was my first fuck up. i get a text from sam about the sink, he basically says that you need to not do that and the others had to redo the dishes. now the sink may had been dirty but my dishes were certainly clean so i send a reply saying sorry, but it could be read in a wrong tone. after that i'm in a bad mood and snap at my family a bit. anyway cut to half an hour ago (12.30ish) i'm laying in bed being mad at myself and sam when i remember to ask for a day off. i asked him in person but he told me yes, and to text him. so i did, at 12.30 in the morning. like the dumbass i am. he hasn't replied but i expect he probably will be a bit grumpy at me tomorrow morning. i don't think he'll do anything drastic but you can never tell with sam. he's about to loose a lot of staff as we go back to school in feb so i don't hink he'll was to purposely get rid of anyone tl;dr: i didn't clean the sink properly at work then sent a text to my angry boss at 12.30 in the morning asking for a day off. basically i hate myself	🙃
saving money when youre young is good but at the same time it sucks soo.. saving money sucks at all ages (since you have to compromise on budgets/not get stuff you want) but it especially sucks when you're young because you're not "grown up"aka immature so you want more useless shit making it even harder. currently i'm a 19 year old male and i'm a ridiculously huge "fan" of apple. i just think their phones(especially watches) and just all electronics they make look 50x better than android devices. anyway.. i have 7.7k between boa and chase accounts and as i was watching the apple keynote event it was getting extremely hard to not shell out 1.2k for a new phone and 400 for a new watch.. someone take my wallet before i do it. i've also had to hold myself back from going ham on amazon i:	😭

i'm interested in a girl, she seems interested in me, but she's in a relationship that she's expressed displeasure about. what do? i (m25) recently met a girl (24) who climbs at the same climbing gym as me and i think we've really hit it off (i say "i think" because i was diagnosed with mild asperger's a year and a half ago which was a broadside hit to my confidence in my ability to read body language and social cues). we've climbed 1-3 times a week for about 4 weeks now, and as soon as we met i knew i had major feelings for her. after the second time we climbed i found out through conversation that she has a boyfriend. so i took the l and started the process of moving on. we continued to meet up to climb and as we did so, it kept resetting the process: we'd climb, i'd get major feelings, we wouldn't climb for a couple days, i'd feel like i had moved on, we'd climb again, repeat. part of the reason it resets is because every time we climb, i'm picking up on a vibe of extreme interest on her part: giving each other light shit if we bail on a climb or otherwise screw up, making a joke while the other is climbing that makes the other have to bail because they're laughing, jokingly pushing me or tapping my shoulder to emphasize a point, offering to adjust my harness without me asking just because i said it was being a pain in the ass. this past weekend she asked me to take pictures for social media as she climbed, i sat down in a chair to review them with her and she stood behind me and leaned on my shoulder as she was reviewing them. the reason i doubt these signals is because texting has pretty dry and basically just used to plan climbing days (although one time after i told her i'd be gone for a few days on vacation she said "how am i supposed to climb without my partner "). i know that some people are just naturally flirty and don't want to read into something any meaning that isn't there, but i also don't want to be missing blindingly obvious signals. about a week and half ago, it came out that she's not happy with her relationship (growing stale, doesn't feel special, etc.). i expressed sympathy for the situation and related it to a recent long term relationship of mine that had ended. i didn't pry so as not to come across as eager about this situation. we talked about it briefly, and then continued to climb. this past weekend, we met up again and i asked her "how's life?" and she said "it sucks." i asked why and she said "considering breaking up with my boyfriend." we then talked for about 5-10 minutes about the situation as she opened up about it (part of this included her saying she didn't really care if the relationship ended). note that this is the same day that she adjusted my harness of her own accord and leaned on my shoulder to review the pics. now we come to what i need advice on: i feel like i've been in a whirlwind for the past month and i just want it to stop. i want clarity on the situation and don't know if i should ask tell her about the vibes i've been picking up on and ask if there's anything there. but i'm willing to endure the whirlwind and sit on this feeling if it's my best chance at making something happen with her down the line. my dilemma is this: ask what's up and risk losing a friend and climbing buddy because of residual awkwardness after the fact, or wait and see what happens and possibly miss the train. the last thing i want to do is interfere in a relationship, but this feeling is getting to be a lot to handle. so i repeat my question from the title: what do?	😢
i just got into an argument about foot fetishes lol someone asked about foot fetishes and i said that they are caused by a dna swap between your genitalia and and feet part of the brain and that it was a mutation and someone had to comment that it wasn't a mutation and no one knows what causes it lol. after a while i started trolling (mods if you see this you can suspend me if ya want) and being obnoxious while i was on call with some friends. wow.	😂

my [22f] boyfriend [23m] of 3.5 years can't commit to same-day plans here's a conversation we had about this which should say it all: me: i'm gonna pick up beer him: i'm still down in [hometown 30 minutes away] baby, maybe tomorrow. him: sorry for the last-minute bs. me: whatever me: i'm sorry, you didn't mean to flake him: sorry again baby. me: yeah ik you don't do it intentionally. did the family part make you anxious? [thinking he might have social anxiety] him: not what i was thinking about. i'm just still in [town 30 minutes away] him: will be a couple more hours me: i could still come over late :p him: maybe baby, but i don't think so. me: that's fine, it just makes me feel unimportant. me: i don't think i've ever cancelled plans with you. him: fucking sorry, i said we might hang out and you know what usually happens when i go to [town 30 minutes away]. me: you seem angry, let's both cool off for awhile. additional context: earlier i said he could just pick me up and take me down there with him. he said he was just going to be tutoring his little brother and doing laundry, not hanging out. so this "you know what happens when i go down to [town 30 minutes away]" comment really bugged me. tldr; boyfriend flaked last-minute again. i told him how it made me feel and he got angry and said i should assume flakiness when he goes home. don't know if i'm going to accept this behavior much longer, especially when he displayed anger when i stated that it affected me emotionally.	😊

my first cake day! today marks my first anniversary of joining reddit and i can say that it's been a really fun year. i've loved interacting with the different communities that i've joined, sharing what i've made or seen to like minded people and even seeing what others have to say. seeing as i lurk this subreddit a lot i thought i'd stop that by making this post so hey everyone	😊
random thought on friendships and romantic love. i was thinking about what is like to have friendship with someone who is mature and wise. perhaps someone i can connect with and understand me, never abandon me when talking to other friends. as well as hanging out just the two of us. someone i could talk to with an interesting topic. but that "someone" is really hard to find. i have also wondered what is feels like to be romantically in love with someone. i mean i did fell in love with an imaginative person every few days. however, that wasn't love. it's like you are in love with someone that doesn't exist, and you continue to do so. what is real love is like? how deep it is? why are people so obsessed the idea of romantic love?	🤔

going outside and breaking an old woman's wrist. this happened about 10 minutes ago. so there's an alley next to my house and i walked outside. there happened to be an old woman (probably 80-85) walking her dog and i guess i scared the dog, so it jumped at me barking and the woman fell over. she tried to catch herself with her left hand and, from the look of it, either dislocated or broke her wrist/hand. i ran up to her and sat her up, supporting her properly, proceeding to let her catch her breath. after a minute or so, thankfully, a neighbor came outside and saw what was up. apparently they know one another; he called his wife or friend, while i helped the old lady get back up, and she came running down the alley to help him assist her back to her house. i don't want to go outside anymore tl;dr i went outside and an old lady's dog pulled her over, causing her to fall over and mess her wrist up from trying to catch herself.	😢

me (19f) confronted my bf (20m) about his relationship with his best friend (also his ex) and i'm quite hurt by his response. sorry if this ends up being quite long. so i finally decided, after 7 months, to discuss my feelings on my boyfriend's relationship with his best friend. she is his ex, but as he says, 'it was a stupid/meaningless 1 month thing'. they have been friends for 4 years now, and have apparently been through many things together. every time i see him, without fail, he will talk about her. it could be anything. for example, today i said i needed to go to a piercing place to get some jewellery. 'oh i know where it is. [bestfriend] has dragged me there before.' fine, okay. it's just little things about that, it happens like 2-3 times every time i hang out with him. so, i told him i feel second best to her. he's hung out with her 3 times this week now, he's seen me twice. and he's going clubbing with her tonight. he got pretty defensive. 'i'm not giving up a 4 year relationship for a girlfriend' i didn't ask him to. 'we've been through so much together, we're basically the same person'. he also said she is his best friend, to which i said 'am i not your best friend?' 'no, you're my girlfriend; there's a difference.' that hurt. it just feels like he prefers her company over mine. then he said he supposedly talks about all his friends like that. he doesn't. there's a certain contentment when he talks about her specifically. i said 'i bet your previous girlfriends also had a problem with your relationship with [bestfriend]?' 'well, one of them did.' eventually he just started smiling, saying 'i just don't know what to say.' he thinks i am jealous of her, i am not. it would just be nice to not feel second best. i also want to note that i absolutely am not asking him to end their relationship! i literally just want him to change his *attitude*, not their relationship. this is why i'm hurt. he doesn't seem to care that it genuinely hurts my feelings. so, am i overreacting? or is this a dealbreaker for anyone else? if he cannot stop talking about her, i think i will have to end it. but again, i don't know if i'm just being insecure... i just don't know. thanks for anyone who read this far. tl:dr: boyfriend talks about his female best friend a lot. hangs out with her more than me at this point. i don't know if i'm overreacting from insecurity, or if its making me insecure, or if i'm being reasonable.	❤️
i have a crush on my bestfriend its ny first realy crush and i know him for 8 years now. hes super nice, always helps other and so hot. im just to shy to make a move on him. hes most likely straight. im also not out to anyone. why does this happen to me?	😭
and dislocated my shoulder this is one of those things i have told myself that would never happen to me. what kind of bum dislocates their shoulder? i've had plenty of chances and it never happened so i figured i'd be fine. boy i was wrong. so i'm playing park district softball with my friends. our team is 0-14 and it's our last game of the season so i'm trying so hard cuz i wanna win. an average speed ground ball gets hit to my left side at shortstop, so i chase it down, miss the ball and boot it into right field. i go full on sprinting as hard as i can after the thing and think "i'll do a cool slide play and pop up and gun the ball home"...anyways i go to do my showboat slide play and how slick the grass is catches me completely off guard, so without thinking i put my elbow down to stop all 260 pounds of myself so i don't slide way past the ball. now i'm a construction worker by trade so my shoulders are strong, but i guess they aren't supple. my arm got yanked up and my shoulder popped on contact with the ground. currently sitting in my computer chair realizing that i can't even play games while i recover. won't try to showboat again . tl:dr slid for a ball in softball, used elbow to try to stop myself and pop back up, shoulder popped out.	😂
my first ex. hi. as you probably know from reading the title, this is about my first ex and how everything with our relationship went to hell in just about 2 months. the people in this story will have different names, because of privacy reasons. so we have me (also referred to as melody), ozzy (my ex), nova and dani (my best friends), matt (my classmate) english is also not my first language so, sorry. shall we begin? yes we shall. this all starts out in the beginning of 7th grade. (we were all 13.) i had just started a new school and got to know dani and nova straight away. we became best friends and as i'm writing this, we still are. but we were also hanging out with the boys in our year alot. at first it was only the guys in our class but soon they introduced us to their other friends in our year. ozzy being one of them. me and ozzy didn't get along straight away. it took a while for us to get to know each other and be able to have conversations without our other friends involved. but when that happened i realized that i liked him. i began to notice the butterflies in my stomach as he walked by in the hallway and how i got all giddy when talking to him. though there seemed to be nothing from his side. moving on to after summer break of 7th grade, meaning we became 8th graders. matt got to know about my feelings for him, as he overheard me talking to dani. matt is a bit of a special person. most of the time he's nice and funny but sometimes he turns into the typical school bully for a while. for no particular reason. in the classroom our desks were placed in rows, and i just happened to be sitting between matt and dani, nova being on the other side of the classroom sadly. if only she had been a bit closer, she could've saved the situation. anyway, matt showed me his laptop screen. it was a microsoft teams conversation with ozzy. thats already when i knew it was going south. fast. it looked something like this: matt: hey dude ozzy: hi, wyd? matt: nothing. anyway what do you think about melody? ozzy: uhh shes nice ig matt: well she likes you at this point i was furious. i started lecturing him about how that's something you just don't do to someone behind their back. dani tried to help but didn't know what to do. he just kept on rubbing it in my face that my crush now knew i liked him, and i could feel my anxiety welling up so i just cut the argument off. and silently cried into my sleeve for the rest of class. i got home, threw myself on my bed and cried even more. i was certain he didn't like me back and i could see a future of teasing and bullying from him and his friends. until i checked my phone, that is. i saw ozzy had texted me. my heart began to race. this is how the conversation went: ozzy: hello me: hi ozzy: wyd? me: not much. you? ozzy: same. then he went silent for a while. ozzy: what matt said today, was that true? me: ..yea it was. ozzy: well then. i wanted to send you a message during class but i was in a group project and it would've been awkward to have someone find out but.. he went silent again but i could see he was typing. ozzy: i like you too. me: seriously? as more than a friend? ozzy: yep :) me: i can't believe it omg ozzy: would you believe me if i asked you to be my girlfriend? me: yes!! the tears i had previously cried was now tears of joy. i felt like running around the house screaming, that's how happy i was. and from then on and about 2 months forward, ozzy and i were a thing. we texted and talked on discord almost every day but we quickly realized none of us liked to talk to each other in school. because of our friends. you see, it didn't take long before practically everyone knew about us. i don't even know how. but people were so desperate to see us together. his friends desparately tried to force conversation between us, we couldn't meet up somewhere just the two of us because people refused to leave us alone. we told them, but they still continued. eventually we both stopped trying and kept our relationship a thing trough our computer screens. because of this his friends started picking on me saying all kinds of stupid things. i started avoiding them, which also meant avoiding him. but then, they wrote stupid shit to me on discord. they even sometimes used his discord on his computer whenever they hung out and he had to leave his room, even if it was only for a few seconds. they would call me, yell that we should break up and then hang up. after that i was even afraid of getting calls from my own boyfriend. because i was always afraid it would be his friends and not him on the other end. as our relationship became more and more restricted because of this, people got more and more annoyed. nova and dani were my only support and for a while the only people in school i felt safe around. since things was already a bit of a mess in my life (not going into detail..) i became an anxious trainwreck. but i couldn't tell him, *right?* he would turn and run if i did, *right?* now later i understand this was just my self-concious head thinking he'd be disgusted by me or grow tired of me if he knew how the situation was for me. but i never told him. because i was afraid that one of the few things keeping me happy was going to be torn away from me. eventually he got more and more distant. we talked less and less and one day, in the late half of november 2018, he broke up with me. trough fucking text. at first i felt nothing. at all. then came the anxiety i'm now very familiar with. instead of the comments from his friends about how stupid i was for never talking to him, i was now laughed in the face because he broke up with me. i couldn't see him in the hallways without wanting to run the other way. i had this really twisted and anxious feeling in my stomach whenever i saw him. i really badly wanted to tell him what was going on and how i felt but i thought it'd just seem like an excuse to get him back. i still get this anxious feeling when i see him or his friends. nova and dani are looking out for me and if they ever see him they try to make me walk the other way or they distract me in some way. i'm forever thankful for them. because otherwise, who knows what i could've done. and yet, he still doesn't know.	😂
my class has a science test in 2 & a half hours only like 6 people revised we all gonna fail later scholars	👍
i can't get past the fact that my life feels like it hasn't even really started i'm trans and closeted so like i can't be happy. i can't have friends because i don't want to say i'm male. i hate doing a lot of stuff. and like i'm an adult and it's crazy, i should be way more advanced and even 13 year olds these days are living their life more than me. like people say only you can change your life, but there's not a lot i can do yet	😔

text your mom and/or your dad today don't make big fuss about it,just tell them how much you love them. let them know if you appreciate it how they raised you,maybe in the worst possible situations. i know not everyone has a parent that he feel to tell i love you. we're all gotta go some day,cherish the days you have left with your loved ones. just an sms,whatsapp message or whatever,show them that you think of them ab you're thankful for all the things they've done to raise a good kid like you are. thank your mom for the delicious meals,thank her for teaching you manners,thank your father for forming your personality with his behavior towards you. and even if they did nothing else but feed you and put your head under a roof,tell them you love them. if they didn't raise you right,didn't show you some love,maybe they didn't know better and didn't received any love from their parents. i love you mom,i love you dad .	❤️
i [26m] have sent a gift to my ex [20f] for birthday and i think she will reject it at first she said thank u but u didnt have to.. and after that she said ok just if u havent sent it yet, do not cause i appreciate that u listened to me and i don't want more so thank u. one of the issues we had before break up is that i wasn't surprising her enough. i don't know why she brings up the past. i am only friends with her and the only reason i sent the gift was is because it is her birthday. i don't know how to respond to that reaction and i just ignored it but i will probably feel bad if she does reject it. tl;dr i have sent my ex a gift for birthday and i don't know how to feel about her reaction.	😔
my money is finite yeah i use big boy words	😎
i can't watch movies without subtitles does anybody else have this problem? i'm not a native speaker, but my english is pretty good and i have absolutely no problem watching youtube videos with no subtitles or talking to people in english. but when it comes to movies/tv shows i get lost and understand maybe 70-80% of what's said. it's really weird, i also have no problem watching reality shows and the like, i understand them perfectly. maybe i'm broken	🤔
wow that post above me is amazing give them a hug for that quality post	👍
why is everyone on here so horny and desperate for love? like i don't really get it... personally, i couldn't care less whether i'm in a relationship or not. but everyone here seems to want one... why?	🤔
girl i was interested in and i recently stopped talking, so i got some blues. wanna chit chat? we were never officially together, but things strained us a little too hard. i enjoyed her company a lot and now i'm kinda anxious and lonely while i watch some youtube. i don't wanna talk about what happened tbh, i just wanna get to know some cool people! just light hearted and friendly conversation would be nice so that i get out of my own head	😊
today, i told my best friend about my depression! it feels great! so today, while at work, i went to another clinic in our hospital to take care of some work. to my surprise i met her there. turns out they sent her there for a few weekends as part of her training. so why didn't i knew when she's my best friend? well my depression is lately very bad. and it's hard to stay in contact with guy like me. i often don't respond to calls or any attempts to get in touch with me. so today when i met her, we talked for a few minutes and she was so nice. these days i'm realizing what an asshole i am, not being able to stay in contact with friends like that. so i asked her if she has some time to talk, and i told her pretty much about everything. she took it well, and wants to meet again to talk some more. it's the first time i ever told anyone around my about my issues. even she told me that she always knew me as very strong person, so she's honestly worried and wants me to visit a therapist. i grew up having to hide these emotions, i'm so used to putting up a strong face that i feel like i can't tell someone that in fact, i'm very very broken and i would love to just talk and cry. so this was a pretty big step for me. and it feels great! she wants to meet and talk some more, i'm kinda afraid because she wants me to open and start talking. but i'm really glad that i told her.	😊
everyday i wonder if i'll ever find the love of my life i'm the only one in my circle without a girlfriend. not surprising how i'm the only ugly person in the group as well. i wonder if i'll ever go on romantic dinners dates at restaurants, proposal, have a wedding etc i just can't wait till that moment i'm only 15 i have so long :(	🥺
why does he hate me so much?? m 36 f 33 so according to my partner i'm a slob and i'm lazy. he finds me unattractive because i cannot keep up with him physically and he has lost all respect for me. how do i save this relationship??	🙄
i've got social anxiety. i just went out with work mates last night and... ... now i'm second guessing literally everything i said to them while drunk! was i too loud? rude? probably yes. i'm having a little panic attack and i can't even fall back asleep	😂
have a nice day	😊
giving my weiner a paper cut i have a healthy libido folks, and i never know when the mood will strike. i was playing some ckii the other week and one of the portraits made me horny so i clicked over to reddit for some good fapping leads. as the saying goes, those who fail to plan, plan to fail, and i definitley failed to plan. as i was getting close, i had about three options: shoot on my shirt, the floor, or something/anything within reach. being a human and not an animal (i'm looking at you david) i chose the third, namely a piece of printer paper. here's where i made my biggest mistake. i used my left hand to reach to the printer located to the right of me (my right hand was occupado) and as i brought the paper across and down in a hormone induced flourish, i misjudged the location of my dick and, you guessed it, sliced the side-ish bottom of my dick open (about 5 o'clock if that helps to imagine. it was quite an odd sensation, and although painful, i didn't fully realize what had happened until the blood started oozing onto the paper. i of course immediately imagined an er trip with a half sliced-off dick and freaked the fuck out and nearly passed out in a panic. lucky for me, upon further inspection it was just a flesh ( ) wound, and though quite painful for many days, it healed up nicely with only a shadow of a scar. so kids, if you use paper to shoot your loads onto, be careful not to slice your dicks off! tldr- used a piece of paper to shoot a load onto and nearly sliced my weiner off.	😏

holy shit my sister spent upwards of 500 dollars on my parents credit card on roblox she didn't even think there would notice	😂
i accidentally came out to two of my friends this week it's both hilarious and so very embarrassing. basically: i dropped my phone last week and the screen is messed up. so when you tap on one area, it sometimes spazzes and brings up something totally different. i'm a 21 year old guy. it's not really a secret that dudes sometimes use their phone to watch porn - but usually they delete their history afterwards, which i did not. you can guess how i accidentally came out to two of my buds: wanted to show them something on safari, stupid screen mucks up and brings out my history for all to see. i don't think i've ever turned that dark a shade of red	😅
i'm a big boy i haven't wet the bed in 3 whole days	😎
finals week coming up, stress levels are higher than ever; anyone wanna vent out their stress? i'm behind in two classes and i keep napping instead of studying feel free to let out all your frustration and whatever's stressing you out~	🙃
hey u gotta see this ur cute have a good day	❤️
i (22f) found porn on fiance's (33m) phone, the porn isn't really the main issue my first post on reddit, so not too sure how to go about this, it's a bit of a long story but i'll try my best to keep it as straightforward as possible. anyways, my fiance and i have been engaged for just over a year now, the last year of our relationship has been pretty steady besides a few what i thought were minor issues, i'll get to that in a bit. porn hasn't ever really been a major issue for me, i know some guys just watch it, but i honestly thought it was something my fiance didn't even think about until yesterday. he went to go buy milk or something and my phone battery died, i wanted to check the weather and was going to turn the pc on to do it when i noticed he left his phone behind, we don't have locks or passwords and stuff on our phones so i used his phone instead (less hassle) and it opened straight on his browser history, nothing special besides that i noticed all his history was deleted up until that day, something in me got a bit suspicious and there was the option on the top of the page: "there's more history for this browser/account" or something similar, and honestly i wasn't expecting to find anything, i just wasn't but i did, i found really specific google searches like "30 year old chubby, big boob girls" and similar stuff. i have the worst poker face on earth so i confronted him straight after he got home in the calmest way possible, and he admitted to watching porn occasionally, and that he has actually had a problem with it since he was 15 and its something he's incredibly ashamed of. a bit of backstory; were both christian and he's particularly serious about his faith, and very involved in the church. personally, i don't think he should be ashamed in that way, i firmly believe that those without sin are the only ones who have the right to cast stones but in his own words, this problem has held him back on his spiritual journey, so i understand, he has actually spoken to our pastor about this and a few other things that i was aware of. so what's the problem? it's not even the lying about it that makes me mad or hurt, or even porn in general. i need help on why this has hurt me so bad. he stopped being intimate with me not too long into our relationship and the reasons when it all started were pretty valid, when we met, i was happy and bubbly and he was all over me and when i got comfortable with him he started seeing the ugly side of a pretty bad anxiety disorder i wasn't even aware i had due to drinking and partying my problems away before i met him, i was anxious and jealous and nit picky and difficult and for someone who doesn't know anyone who deals with those problems, it was scary. he stepped back sexually and stopped being so romantic and touchy feely and all that fun stuff, which i brought up on occasion but i just genuinely think he didn't know how to deal with me but he stuck around despite it all and i got better very quickly when i realised the damage it was doing to our relationship, i got on meds over a year ago and i've been doing great, genuinely, even my initial reaction to all this surprised me, a year ago i would have blown a gasket. but he didn't change much, the intimacy never quite got back to where it was and actually went downhill, he went from waking me up at 4am for a bit of fun (which i loved), to hardly even touching me in any kind of intimate way, eventually we sat down and he said that he was growing in the church and that sex before marriage is a mistake we've already made and i actually suggested that we maybe wait till after the wedding, which i genuinely also want to do since i'm also trying to grow in those aspects of my life. we agreed on that over a month ago, but i've always felt something was off in our intimacy. that perhaps he didn't love me as much as i loved him or didn't find me sexually attractive. finding the porn seemed to have confirmed those doubts for me. this stories getting a bit excessively long so now that you know the background i've summed it up. why the porn bothered me so much: - his searches were so specific, chubby, big boobs, much older (30 specifically), i'm average build, small boobs and well, only 22. his exes were all his search criteria, which obviously makes me feel like shit. - he was watching porn while rejecting me sexually and saying it was stress, tiredness, lack of energy that lowered his sex drive (before we mutually decided to hold off till marriage) which makes me feel like he is not sexually attracted to me at all. what happened after i caught him out: - he's genuinely an amazing guy, he admitted his faults and really showed remorse, i explained how it made me feel in detail and he listened. - he wrote me a detailed letter admitting to how he felt after my anxiety issues and felt he needed to protect me/save me which isn't exactly a turn on. (i get it but it's like a punch in the gut) - he also admitted that he wants to be with me and marry me and wants to fix this and that he loves me so much, i've told him how to fix it, i also realise i need to work on my own confidence issues. - the last 24+ hours he really has been trying hard to show me intimacy and give me the attention he says i do deserve, i've been trying hard to move past it and look forward. the whole reason i've decided to post this is because i don't have anyone that we aren't mutually friends with to vent to, or talk to and i refuse to damage his name with the people we both care about. i love this man with all my heart, this is the first and only time he's broken my trust or heart and i want to get over this as fast as possible and move forward positively. any advice, support or shared experiences will be much appreciated. tia tl;dr : found out fiance is watching porn, the porn itself isn't the problem, being neglected sexually and emotionally whilst he chooses strange women on the internet that are the opposite to me physically over me is what hurts.	❤️

ah man i need to vent abt my crush who likes me back (: he's just so dorky. i love his pretty blue eyes n the way his hair is so messy and sticks up in random places. he has the most amazing smile that makes my heart feel all warm and fuzzy. i can't believe that i would ever meet someone that made me feel this way. we were on a discord call for almost 5 hours straight and it was extraordinary. i'm so enamored with the way he speaks and how he laughs. we jokingly bully each other and i adore it!!! it feels like we've known each other for a very long time, when it hasn't been so long. he just makes me feel so good about myself and i feel so "full" emotionally. i wouldn't wish for anyone else and i didn't have this much in common with anyone ever, not even my best friend of 4+ years. just wow. this boy means so much to me and i am so grateful that i got the chance to meet him. i hope we continue talking for more time, and i hope that one day we will be official.	❤️

i'm going to get ritalin on prescription after being diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, what should i expect basically it was my own idea to have myself being checked out by a psychologist to understand why i was falling in certain patterns over and over again things like: "not being able to finish a education due to lack of motivation, ruining myself financial because i'm impulsive, losing jobs because i keep arriving 5 minutes to late, concentration problems, postponing everything" should be very recognizable for people with add/adhd, iam now 26 years old and i was a real pain when i was young my parents kicked me out because i was un-handable, they didn't understand what was wrong with me, now finally after such a long time of misery i know why i was who i was and did what i did when i was young, and finally i'll be able to change my future. so you'll understand iam thrilled, i love talking to a shrink or psychologist because i finally feel like iam being understood this lifted such a heavy weight of my shoulders, and i'll be able to change for the better and have a bright future. the only thing is as my title says iam really nervous about medication, i don't want to lose my personality iam joyfull and social but iam scared of turning in to a zombie hooked on meds taking one pill after the other to feel "normal" iam scared it might set off a chain reaction and that i'm going to resort to other types of drugs and i'll get addicted to the feeling of "not being myself" tldr; i was hoping to find some people with experience, people who are on any type of add/adhd suppressive types of medication, if my fears are rational or not. please look past the spelling errors and stuff english isn't my native language thanks for reading	😁
i already know when im older imma miss these moments like rn i'm chilling in my room scrolling thru my phone and listening to music and hopefully later i get to smoke weed with my friends and then we're just gonna chill and watch a movie. like imma miss all my friends sooo i really hope i don't fade with anyone	😢

i have been hugging and showing positive attention to a neighborhood boy and his abusive mother just took credit for his change in behavior. i met joe 3 years ago when he was 6 years old. he was in my daughter's class as school. i noticed he takes breaks from the normal school day to do other activities with the special needs teacher and he always made sure to tell me hello or good bye. he made me smile every time. i also learned he lives in the same neighborhood that i do. i seen him riding his bike around and also begging my uninterested daughter to be his girlfriend. as the years went by, i heard his name yelled in the neighborhood a lot. i've seen his mom (amanda) chase him to beat him so many times. she once admitted she didn't know what to do with him and she was thinking about giving him up to the state. the neighborhood looks after joe. they also scream at him for the only attention this poor little boy gets is negitive. amanda is a single mother who works full time. she claims to me that our state does not have any low income daycare options for joe over the summer. she says she can't pay me but asks if i can peak in him throughout the days she's at work. she also states she called cps and they told her if she felt joe was mentally capable of being home alone, he can. i completely sympathise with her situation and told her i would watch him. the min she would leave for work joe would race to my house. he helps me around the house, he gives the best hugs, i tell him "i like you," "i'm happy you're my friend," "great job, bud" ect, you know, the kind of stuff every kid strives to hear. it's been 3ish weeks and i can truly see the happiness in his face these days. he comes over almost every day. his mom calls me and a long conversation short she says, "yeah, i discipline him every single day, i spank his ass and when i hear you say that he's been behaving at your house, i must be doing something right!" tf!?!? if i had a bigger house, i would save him.	😢
from talking phase to not even speaking wr any% speed run ok guys so this is kinda insane. i just broke the world record from going to speaking phase with a girl from my class i like to not even speaking anymore. i was drunk this friday and decided to ask her out for the next week and she did the girl thing of avoiding saying no and just giving me a hidden no. well i'm friends with some of her friends and they just told me that she told them what had happened. in just the span of a few hours i broke the world record. it was a hard hit but you only life once. but anyways, world record baby	😎
my bed creaks at the slightest movement can't even jerk off	🙄
i kind of want to reach out to a guy that i've always kind of liked. i've talked to him a handful of times in person, and i've always enjoyed his company. we both just got out of super duper long term relationships, and we both just got cheated on. i don't want to flirt with him necessarily, but i feel like we could possibly heal from our experiences together i guess? i don't know what i should do, but i can't get this guy off of my mind for whatever reason . should i reach out to him?	😂
my boyfriend [25m] isn't interested in any long-distance flirtation with me [25f] we're doing the long distance thing for a year and we're 5 months in. we aren't having any communication problems (constant texting, daily phone calls/facetimes) and we manage to see each other once a month. i'm definitely not feeling neglected in that sense, and when we are together we can't keep our hands off each other. my problem is that i have a high sex drive and i'm horny pretty much the entire time we're apart. i'm faithful and i'm not into porn, so i really want to keep our sexual connection going from afar. i've tried to turn our skype dates sexy but he isn't into it. i've tried to dirty text him but he changes the subject. i send him nudes and get no response (ouch lol). when i asked him for nudes he said he isn't into that, and that i can stop sending them. i don't want to force him to do something he doesn't want to do, or is uncomfortable with, but i'm dying over here and it hurts that he doesn't seem to have any interest in fulfilling my needs while we're away. i'm a visual person and i like to think about the person i'm with when i masturbate. just sticking my vibrator down there doesn't do it for me. it's gotten to the point where i've considered digging up my ex's photos and using those, but that feels like cheating to me. at this point i am getting angry at him for not being interested in keeping our relationship exciting by trying something new for me. i'm also starting to wonder if he finds me attractive because he's not interested in sending and receiving pictures. i thought he would find it hot that i want to masturbate to him and only him. am i being selfish and/or unreasonable and is it wrong for me to feel hurt and neglected by his disinterest in exchanging nudes, etc? sex is a huge part of a relationship for me and that's why i've never done long distance in the past. i really want to make this work but i feel like i'm starving at this point. any advice from fellow long-distancers is appreciated tl;dr my long-distance boyfriend isn't interested in keeping things sexual from afar and it's ruining our relationship	😊
is there any part of your body that you notice but no one else does? most of the time no one notices but i have a freckle above my top lip and i notice it all.the.time. it bothers the heck out of me but at the end of the day it's really unnoticeable to someone who's not looking for it. just wondering if y'all have something like that? because for me it's super annoying but it's literally not a big deal. y'all can joke but i'm genuinely asking.	🤔
guess what i got today? my first perfect wires in among us, im feelin really about it rn	😏
sometimes , i like to tell my beautiful he's beautiful. it make him feel very very happy and blushing haha . sometimes our partners need to hear what they tell us	❤️

my drug abuse is getting me into trouble hey all, i'm a bit new here so if i mess up on something i apologize. i'm 17, and i unfortunately don't much to look forward to in life because well, my habits are getting the best of me. i hate to admit this 100%, but i currently abuse prescription drugs and cannabis often. i hate myself for it. it's giving me a depression and turning me down in life. this all started when my girlfriend of 8 months decided to leave me after a remark i made about her, jokingly but she took it serious. this whole year has been ass. i was once a happy person, with good grades and good motives, and physically fit, but due to the recent mishaps in my life they've taken a turn for the worse. i need to stay an extra year in high school because of my decisions, and i should have graduated. i wasnt accepted into the college i was aiming for, and not even the job i wanted to work. i decided to quit my current job, which was my first job that i've had since grade 10. all because i take pills and i smoke. it's fucking me up. also, she fucked me up so bad. i quit smoking weed for the time we were together but recently i've grown back into it. i can't even explain how much i hate myself, doing things like xanax used to be a state of euphoria and calamity, now its just an addiction. im crying as i make this post. i have no source of help, i'm slowly digging my grave. to those that will say "get help from a therapist" or stuff like that, i want to let you know that i've done so before but nothing ever will work. my parents can't even help me, although they did their best and hate me for doing what i've done. i apologize for the text, i just wanted to vent.	😔
it is time to vibe	😎
my guys we got a problem my gf is driving before me . rip my totally real masculinity.	😭
hello hii what's up how was your day, you having fun?	😳
how do i (25m) talk to my gf (28f) who is grieving? i also posted this in /r/relationship_advice this girl and i have been dating for some months now, since the beginning of february. we have a lot in common, and we get along really well. everything was going pretty good, but recently things have gotten a little distant. her father passed away in september, who she was very, very close with, and her grandmother on her mother's side passed away last month in april. she was pretty upfront about her loss, and she's staying with her mother while everything gets everything sorted. she only recently moved to columbus in november, to be with family while her dad was sick, so she just started a busy 50 hr work week job, and she adopted a dog too. needless to say, she's got a lot on her plate. i mention all of this to illustrate that i realize she is busy, not only with the loss of two of her family members, but just life in general. it's just since her grandmother passed away, we haven't been spending as much time as usual. she texts me less, which she was never very good at in the first place, but now it's not as much. we still hang out usually 2-3 times a week, as i have my own career and daughter (previous relationship) to take care of, but i feel our dates have grown shorter and shorter. i am diagnosed with anxiety, so every little thing i tend to over analyze. i'm not sure how to bring up that fact that i want us to be closer without being insensitive to the fact that she's going through so much right now. i've never had a loss like hers in my life yet, so its hard for me to imagine exactly what she's going through.. which is what i think the issue might be here. ive been trying to be supportive by bringing her and her family food, a shoulder for her to cry on, etc. it genuinely makes me sad to see her sad, which is the worst part. i have such intense feelings for this girl, she's beautiful and she makes me really happy. all i want to do is spend time with her, but i also don't want to bug her too much because i know that's unattractive. tl;dr how do i bring up spending more time with this girl who's going through such a tough time in her life without sounding like a selfish asshole? am i being unreasonable?	😔
i personally think the hole you've dug is hilarious so, there is this girl who i was in a thing with for a few months, but unbeknownst to eachother until later on, we had both had a crush on eachother for about 3-4months prior. anyway, this girl decides to keep our "thing" a secret, using the excuse that her friends wouldn't approve. after months of being happy and sad and usual stuff, she sends me a text out of the blue that says this: <url> me, obviously quite upset ask her what's going on, and she tells me she is back with her ex. after multiple arguments she openly says to me that she wants me rather than him, but couldn't break up with him because it wouldn't be fair on him. so i discuss this information with my friends, (who also are her best friends). they all back my side after i show them how unfair and dishonest she has been, not only to me, but to all of them too.l so, i decide to get over her, when i do, she decides it's perfectly okay to give me the cold shoulder and cry to her boyfriend about how much she loves me. after all of this, he is too oblivious, or stupid, or maybe desperate to not break up with her after everything she has done. anyway, i get a girlfriend and the ex then sends me a text saying that she still loves me. i, feeling guilty tell my then girlfriend and she dumps me. fine, whatever, from this point i decided that i'd had enough of my ex ruining things for me and so i block her on anything, about 2 weeks later one of my oldest friends tells me that my ex is confused on why i cut her off and wants to be friends. being the guy that i am, i send her a message apologizing for everything that's happened and ask if she wants to try to at the very least be friends. this in my opinion is where i think the hilarity comes in, she sends me a message saying "stop telling people our shit, you're ruining my life and turning my friends against me, we can never be friends". now here i want to turn around and say " it's my shit, i can tell who i like " but alas, i figure an argument will only be petty. so, i send her this: <url> a quick "fuck off" ensures and i respond for the last time with this : <url> i don't think she's going to be talking to me anytime soon and i'm so happy about that. tl;dr crazy ex is a bitch, her actions result in her friends not liking her, she gets bitchy with me, i become a honey badger and don't give a fuck	😂
just decided to pick a fight with a grandma on tiktok she's pressed about cross-stitching of all things. specifically a pattern that is a pineapple wearing sunglasses with the word "slut" sewn underneath. as someone who has cross-stitched for over 6 years (and also has made an "obscene" cross stitch for a friend lol), i thought it might be fun to troll for a bit . her name is deborah too lol	😏
omg wait they just invited me to play just dance with them later people in college are so nice tf	🥺
i've been reading more and more about anarchism and i notice how i say "wait that makes sense" alot, help i swear i'm not an anarchist i just think they have some cool ideas	😭
making new friends? has anyone been feeling like they're low on friends lately? i'm in my third year of uni and i haven't really made any mates (my own fault, i rarely, if ever go to my classes). but yeah, been feeling like i need to meet some new people so i made a group called melbourne mates on an app called amino to hopefully make some new friends and help others make some too. i made some public chatrooms on there so people with similar interests can chat and/or meet up and bond. it's stuff like gaming, tv shows, foodies, bar hopping etc, you get the drift the group is called melbourne mates because i'm from melbourne, australia myself so i made it for those living in melbourne, but i figured people can still make online friends when it comes to stuff like gaming and talking about your favourite shows and music etc here's the link if anyone is interested: <url> on another note, how was everyone's day today? do anything interesting?	😊
poor doggo. you will be missed my doggo is gonna be put down pretty soon ive had her since i was 6 months old. the house is gonna feel so empty	😢

choosing a course i live in ireland and just chose 2 courses that i could do in college. i can change them later but the ones i chose now r architecture and accounting and finance. i was wondering if u guys had any course suggestions that would pay fairly well as a job in the future and was also interesting. i'm very physically active and i'm good at art if that's any help. pls help out. my parents just want me to get a course which would pay well	🙄
well boys, i tried i decided yesterday to finally ask the girl i like out and tell here how i felt (bc i knew she felt the same way too) but it turns out she doesn't feel like that anymore and is dating someone else but ya know, it's alright bc i'm just happy i finally got it all out there and now i don't need to get my hopes up about her and i can just move on! so basically moral of the story, if you get rejected that's fine, you just need to look for the good in the bad and just know it's ok to move on after	😎
trying to get fit this happened a few months back during my school holidays. i recently started my tertiary education and joined my school's football club around a year back in 2016 as i really enjoyed playing football since i was a kid. having trained about half a year or so, it was a few more months leading up to the competitions and since it was the holidays, it seemed important for me to take this time to train up abit to prepare for the upcoming competitions. as my coach had previously mentioned that it was important for us to bulk up abit and be a little beefier so that we could be stronger on the ball and not get outmuscled that easily. naturally, i figured that the holidays would be a good time to do so and what better way than a good nutritious diet to come along with it. before that, i had seen a couple of videos and websites where people would consume raw egg white as a form of protein for the body. so, in an attempt to get fit, i decided 'hey, why not?' and ended up grabbing an egg and consuming the raw egg white, while probably exposing myself to a gazillion molecules of samonella. and thats where i fked up and for the subsequent weeks to come, constant vomitting and diarrhoea ensued. turns out its not too good an idea to eat raw eggs when you've never tried it before. tl;dr: wanted to get fit but got samonella instead	😐

have you ever done this or had this happen to you? so my friend jason had a girlfriend named yarilez (they're both 14) for only like 2 months and a few days, jason wanted to break up with her because he lost feelings. she didn't wanna break up until they hit 3 months which was in 4 days. he tells me she's psycho and that she doesn't make him happy. i told him just to end it with her and that's that. he tried and she still begged for them to reach 3 months. "for her sake" she still thinks they're in a relationship even though he doesn't text her back. i don't understand. she then tried hitting on me and then asked me why i don't like her.. so jason is my friend i would never do that to him. idk i don't understand.	🙄

protective doggo i dogsit for a friend when they go away on holiday or something. they have one dog (a 60lbs shepherd mix) and one cat that wobbles when he walks. i let them sleep in the bed at night but the dog never cuddles with me like he usually does when everyone is home. i asked my friend about it and she said it was because he was 'protecting me' cause he knew that it was just us in the house instead of mom, dad, and me. he's such a good boy it melts my heart i love him so much any people with pets that also go protective when some people aren't home? i'd love to hear some more stories like this!	😭

i [18f] am crushing on coworker [21m] i'm 18. he's 21. we both work at a grocery store. he worked there before i was hired but quit before we had a chance to work together but just very recently came back. i'm crushing kinda hard. we mostly just joke around with each other a lot. he's typically pretty friendly but since i've started to develop feelings i've started to over analyze most of our interactions with usually just leads me to getting my feelings hurt in the middle of a shift. lol. yesterday i jokingly was talking about him helping me get carts and he basically said no and said he doesn't know me well enough yet to want to help me yet?? he did grab a few on his break when he was outside and told me "don't say i didn't help you out" it was weird. some of the things he does comes off flirty like saying things like "about time" when i bag for him, making random comments when i'm talking to another co-worker, and saying things like "don't lie you're not working" and jokingly taking the schedule from me when i was looking at it. i was outside when he got off a hour before me last night and he acted like be was gonna push me over on the ice after i told him it's a good thing i haven't fell yet. he said "just kidding" and pretended to fall. most people i work with knew him the first time he worked there so he is closer to them and i don't know how to naturally just get to know him better and make a good impression. i like joking around but since my feelings are kinda sensitive since i've developed feelings i overanalyze things. i want to be one of the people he's at least friends with at work but i feel like i'm being overshadowed by people he's known longer. he's physically attractive to me but i actually really enjoy his personality. he's easy to talk to, joke around with, pretty friendly, and likes to talk which are all things that i like about him so far. i don't know what to do really. he comes off flirty sometimes but other times not so much. since i've gained feelings for him i've started to become a little more sensitive to things he says and jokes about. can guys who are interested come off rude when they joke sometimes? him denying helping me because he doesn't know me well enough yet made me doubt things a little bit. lol. i get liking co-workers isn't always the best idea but our work environment isn't intense. it's not my career. i don't plan on being there forever. also i just can't help it i'm on register with him for basically my entire shift saturday and our store isn't too busy so there is usually time to talk to the people you work with frequently. it's my shot to start to becoming a little closer but i don't want to just ruin things. we'll probably be on registers right next to each other. what are good conversations to engage in? advice? this post was kinda a mess. sorry for the typos. lol. thanks in advance :) i made another post about this a few days ago that's a little more detailed on some things. tldr: i like a guy at work. having trouble telling if he's being flirty or his usual self. i'm one of the only people at work that he hasn't worked with before & would like to get closer.	😂
ok so basically, i think the comments might be down	🤔
everyone postin "fuck girls" what if i don't wanna fuck girls i just wanna listen to clairo with her while the rain hits the window and we eat pizza pops as i absolutely demolish her in speed checkers while enjoying the sweet smell of breakfast in the kitchen down below as the clock annoyingly ticks in the background	😔
ok nice i gotta get 4 tests done tomorrow recently got diagnosed with asthma but i gotta do an extra test to be 100% sure but i also had high blood pressure and a fast heartbeat which is probably because of my anxiety but i didn't say that. my doctor now thinks i might have heart disease or something so i gotta get 2 blood tests and a urine test to test that so that's cool pretty sure my blood pressure n fast heart rate was cuz of anxiety cuz i was also nervous n shaky while in the office but ig i'll find out. fuck i'm scared	😎
anyone else ever try to get an "addiction?" i put addiction in quotes because i don't actually want a full blown addiction. more like a tinder profile "omg i'm addicted to running" addiction. i'm super prone to addiction. i've never drank or smoked bc i know myself well enough to know it'll end badly. i'm addicted to sugar, definitely. if sugary or bready foods are available, i typically don't stop eating them until i feel a little sick- even if i know i'm not hungry or whatever. definitely also addicted to tv- i binge watch like nobody's business. i have a lot of little short butrsts of addiction to various crafts (knitting, sewing, needle work). over the past yearish, due to college induced stress and getting hitched, i've gained like 10 lbs. and i started out about 10 lbs heavier then i would like to be . so i want to become "addicted" to exercise. the only issue is: it's summer! i don't have access to the campus gym for 3 months! anyone else feel like they're easily addicted, or try to become "addicted" to something?	😂

you know what i really want/need right now? so i enlisted in the military a few months ago(bout 8mo?) and i haven't been able to do this since then because we're not allowed to. alright so, i used to live in the best state in north america, california of course :) lmao and the sun was always out i didn't care how fucking hot it was i always enjoyed this. i'd go from my house, make a quick stop at the grocery store, get a "bang" energy drink, get in the car and blast my music and ac. i'd drive like 2x around the city before finally stopping at the gym then blasting my music on my airpods. shit i miss driving did i mention going 75 on the highway?	😭

last reddit post; i want to be "normal" and happy, if not forever at least for one day someone has been stalking me. all of my posts go to 0 within minutes-hour after posting them and i realized i post too much personal info on reddit. instead of dealing with it i prefer to just make a new account and get rid of this one, eh i thought i'd make one last post before scrapping it. i wish i could be normal and happy for at least one day. i have had depression for 11 years. it started when i was in 3rd grade and it's still here. for as long as i can remember i've been alone, i've taken care of myself, i became mature decades before i was supposed to. all i want is to be happy for at least one god dammit day. holy fuck sigh. fuck life. oh a side note, any suggestions for my new account's username?	😔

heya, am looking for some relationship advice recently (and most likely due to valentines day fast approaching), alot of my classmates have been pushing me towards starting a relationship with a long-time friend of mine. me and her have been friends for about 3 years now. we've talked alot about all manner of subjects both in person and over whatsapp, have gone out together to eat sometimes, and have even exchanged gifts on occasion. seems like a perfect match, right? well... i unfortunately have quite a lot of doubts. i know that there exists a pretty significant difference between liking each other as friends and as romantic partners - with the failure to recognise this difference usually ending in broken friendships - and i'm really not sure which one of these two is my relationship with her. i'd be down to get into a relationship, but i'm not sure if she thinks the same way, and if she doesn't, me asking her out could have some serious ramifications for the future of our friendship. so yeah... i'm really hesitant to ask her out rn. i'm gonna need some of ya relationship experts here to help me determine whether she likes back as a romantic partner or not before i commit to doing anything funny. to that end, here's a quick summary of our relationship: we met each other in school, and started talking alot since a)we sat next to each other in class and b)we both shared an interest for drawing, writing and most recently also anime (it was mainly her that got be into it by convincing me to pick up demon slayer lol) after 2 years together in school we graduated and went to separate places for further education, but we still live quite close by and bump into each other occasionally. towards the end of last year i asked her if she wanted to eat lunch with me to reconnect abit (we had not met each other in person for almost a year at that point) and i had a blast! we had lots of fun telling stories about our new classmates and i gushed to her about a fictional story i was writing for like 30 whole minutes. am planning on doing this again a couple months down the line :) not long after that, she got me to watch the entire demon slayer s1 series so that we could watch the movie together, and the interesting thing about that was that it was actually the second time both me and her had watched that movie (she had watched it longgg before and i had watched it with another group of friends not long before going with her). still tho, we had fun talking about random stuff relating to the movie. when we aren't talking in person, we are talking over whatsapp, with a new conversation relating to just about any topic popping up once every week or so with a pretty even mix between me and her starting said conversations. well, that basically summarises. i am now asking all ya teenage relationship experts: just friends or shows possible signs of deeper relationship? on a random side note, i recently had a fun little poll on my instagram story where i asked people to used a slider to determine how much of a certain trait they saw within me, and for the "romantic" trait she was the only one to have given me a big fat 0	😅

anyone know how i can stop this negative mindset? soooo... i've been on "the grind" lately. going to school, going to work, going to the gym, repeat. it's great, don't get me wrong. i love the feeling of satisfaction i get after i complete everything i need to do for the day. here comes the problem... i do all these things and feel great, but then feel dread and anxiety when i think about the fact that i have to keep going to the gym 4-5 days a week to get the results i want. the fact that i have to go to school 3 days a week, every week, for the next few months. my problem is once i get everything done i feel great until i think of the fact that i have to keep doing all this every single day, over and over again. maybe my problem is i don't have enough variety of things going on in my day, but i'm not sure. it kinda feels like that one episode of spongebob where squidward moves to that new apartment and he does the same thing every single day. he likes it at first, but within a few days he's miserable. anyone relate? anyone got any tips they could give me?	😅

advice please: bf uses name of ex as character in big writing project, how do you feel? tldr: bf uses name of ex as character in big writing project, how do you feel? some facts: --you are not kids (40s, 50s) --your boyfriend uses the not common name of a former girlfriend (dated maybe 5 years)as a character in a big writing project --the name has come up several times in the past couple of years including saying... --he won't see her casually because of what happens when they're together and referring to it as a chink in the armor --being proud of himself for saying hi and just riding away when he saw her on the street --you say it's a peculiar that he would use the name of an ex as a character and ask if there's something you need to know (not mean, not angry, not accusing, just wondering if something happened in the past you don't know about) --his mood changes noticeably and is very upset that you even mentioned it and gets very defensive and condescending and angry that you find it odd because he swears it's an innocent choice even though he admits he himself stopped to think about it before choosing. he thinks you're asking if something is going now and swears there is nothing wrong with choosing that name and implies that i'm less than secure and don't believe he loves me for even bringing it up. --you are confident and secure in yourself and the the relationship and not generally jealous and have never accused or implied anything now or in the past. the issue was bringing it up. so do you just not say or ask anything? pretend not to notice? swallow it? how do you feel? what do you do in that situation?	😏
anyone wanna talk pls do hmu	😁
so i need advice on migrating to another country this is my first time moving and i just moved from the philippines to the united states, are there any tips you guys have for people moving? i'm kind of not used to this and i don't know how to wing it. p.s. if this is a place to make friends then i'd like to say hello	😊
married/couples of reddit, what are your atypical i-knew-they-were-the-one stories? my favorite (so far): been friends with my homegirl for about 12+ years. her i-knew-his-was-one story is cute, girly....imo, pretty typical. decided to get his perspective on things. hubby said he knew she was the one when they were driving around one day and he really needed to scratch his back. he tried to reach but couldn't. without having to be asked, my friend reach over and scratched his back on the exact spot. that did it for him. been in love ever since!	😂
should i even bother trying to remain contact with my family anymore? (24f) sister (23f), father (46m) my father has always put my sister before me. buying her countless things meeting with her all of the time. he then complains about her too me. such as every year he gives her a bunch of money and takes her out to eat at a restaurant. this year she said she wants to go out with friends and will meet him after to pick up money. he messaged me crying that he did all of this stuff for her but she can't even meet with him. i just told him that sucks. for my bday he gives me 10 dollars if he doesn't forget and has never taken me out. i don't really care about the material items, i'm more bothered about him coming straight to me to complain about her. i tried to get along with my sister. i would invite her out and she would agree and then last second say "oh yeah, i forgot we agreed to meet and i'm with my friends now lol." she has done this every single time. i just stopped inviting her and she has never invited me anywhere. the thing that hurts me most is she never texts me i always text her first and i texted her for her bday and apparently she got a new number and had posted on facebook the day before "the people that matter to me have my number." i thought it was the number i had saved but apparently not. my sister only texted me when her car broke down and she needed rides and when her bfs dump her and she needs somewhere to stay. my dad only texts me to complain about my sister. i tried talking to him and he always responds with lol,k,cool. should i ask for her number? small story when we were around 18, i got picked up from school by my uncle for my bday i was super excited and asked if my sister was coming he said no. when we got to resteraunt my dad showed up for free food. i asked if he would pick up my sister and he said "no." and i said "why not?" and he said "cause it's your birthday" and i said "we should get my sister!" he then said "oh my god, we are not getting your sister. on her bday we took her out and you know how much she asked about you coming? never. she never brought you up once." i was sad and got a text from my sister she was on lunch and she said "is dad going to pick me up?" and i said "he said no." and she said " that's fucked up!" and then she said "i bet you didn't even ask them to get me,you stupid bitch."	🥺

how do i(35f) tell my boyfriend (32m) my relationship with my best friend/ex-bf(35m) and family is non-negotiable? background: i broke up with my ex 7-8 years ago. sometime after our break up, my family abandoned me and left me alone and with a pile of credit card debt. during this time, him and his mom adopted me, helped me when i was depressed, cosigned loans, cooked for me, helped me out and basically the family i needed. i'm in a much better place now and we still keep in touch. i still call his mom regularly and she spoils me like her own daughter. now: i've met and fallen in love with a guy long distance and despite everything this might be it. but he has a policy of no friends with exes. in general he's not comfortable with either of us having opposite sex friends . i didn't think we'd make it this far but i'm starting to find i may want to spend the rest of my life with him. because i was a coward and wanted to avoid conflict i let the ex issue fall to the back burner. he's making plans to move towards me so we can take the next step forward. but i know this will come up and it'll be an ugly fight. so far the uanimous advice from my friends is if he asks me to cut ties to my ex and family out this is a deal breaker. i need to know how to bring it up to him without getting his defenses up and turning it into an all out fight. i do love the guy but it's hard to get him to understand this is my chosen family. also worth noting, he's not close with his family and has no friends he considers close friends. tl;dr: new boyfriend doesn't believe in friendships with exes. ex is more like family than ex-lover	🙄
any boy wanna cosplay as killua and let me fuck you im not even horny its just my dream to fuck killua	😔

bored at work hit me up while in at work bored out of my mind !	😭
the man i'm talking to(m 26) is very strange to me(f 24) so i have known this guy for about seven years now. we started hanging out in high school and then when we're out of high school he messaged me and said that he liked me and wanted to go out.the thing is though we tried to make dates but it didn't really work out so we both went our different ways. about one year ago he messaged me and said he liked me still so we started talking but he said he didn't want a relationship he just wanted fwb. i told him i'm not interested in that and we stopped talking again. now i also should say. he is probably one of the biggest trolls ever. he doesn't know how to text people. i'll try to start a conversation with him or just talk to him small talk and all he does is send me gifs or memes and emojis and he always wants to talk about the s word. now just about two weeks ago we start talking again he told me that he was interested in a relationship so we started talking but he's pretty much the same as he was. he still sends me really weird stuff and recently me and my friends were thinking about going on a double date so i've been asking him if he wants to go out with us and he'll be my date, but he keeps avoiding the question every time i ask him. he'll either change the subject or he'll send me some stupid meme with a emoji or a stupid gif, and he still always tries to bring some innuendos into the convo. that doesn't really bother me like a lot but it just annoys me when you're trying to ask somebody out and they keep avoiding the question and changing the subject but they have already said they are interested in a relationship. later on i messaged him and told him how i feel and that i want a serious relationship and i hope that's what he wants and if that's what he wants then maybe we could get together, but he hasn't responded. i really do want to get to know him better and possibly go out with him but he needs to open up more and be more talkative instead of being a creep and just sending memes and gifs all day or ignoring what i've said to him and just sending lols. i just kind of want to get your eyes opinion on what is going on. do you guys think this is work behavior? do you think he's just doing this because he's really likes me and he's nervous to talk? or should i just give up on him because it's not going anywhere? thank you :)	😂
i just heard someone be transphobic on the radio. totally not angry about how fucking normalized it is where i live.	🙃
need help with the next step. alright boys, here's the dealio. i've been talking to a girl for the past week and a half and i think she's interested in me (and y'all know i'm totally interested in her), but i'm kind of at a crossroads in terms of where to go now. i've taken her out to see a movie last weekend, we've had a continuous conversation since last week, we've met up at lunch everyday, but now i dunno where to go. (insert the ol' "i didn't think i'd get this far" meme) should i start flirting and making it more obvious that i'm into her, or keep it chill for right now? i've got conflicting opinions as it's only been a few days since we first met, and i really don't wanna screw this up. this could be my chance to get unlimited gamer girl pee . i'm depending on y'all. don't leave me hanging guys	😎
the idea of washing up blew my mind my girlfriend and i have been dating for a month (18 years old). i felt happy and intrigued as to where the relationship could go in the future and how we'd develop together. we were simply discussing what we'd eat next time she stayed a few nights when she suggested that after we cook, we wash up together. at first, i laughed at the suggestion, but when i thought about it, the idea seemed so nice. so comfortable and secure - in a strange way, so intimate, even though it's just bloody washing up. in a rush of happiness, excitement and fear, it hit me in that moment that my feelings are so much stronger than i'd previously thought. that life doesn't have to be extraordinary to be enjoyable and that little things are incredible sometimes. fuck, it totally caught me off guard. what a terrifying and yet brilliant moment. i just wanted to share, thank you	😊

there are hot singles in my area and they want to have sex with me	😎
my kid, just shy of 3 years and is the best thing in my life (a bit long) so, i am not a huge fan of sharing, let alone on the internet. however, i dont know why but i wanted to share a few things about my almost 3 years old daughter with this amazing crowd on reddit. she starts her day by crawling up between wifey and me, holding onto her mom's hand while playing with my beard. when she goes to brush her teeth, wants her papa by her side while mama helps her with brushing, and while mama is getting her dressed and get ready to go to the daycare. when she's on her way home in the evening, either mama or papa would go to pick her up. as soon as she sees either of us, she just sprints and jumps right into our arms. just today, i had a caught a bit of cold, when she came to know, she asked me if i were sick, i said yes and she took out her toy doctor set, checked me up and gave me an injection so that i could get better by tomorrow. i am so blessed that i have such a lovely kid. not all is a fairytale here, there are times when i am beyond mad at her, but as soon as she realizes that, she would come to me and say sorry. and just like that, all my anger is melted away. she is a very observant kid as well. i wanted her to watch a harry potter movie. we were watching the 1st one, in which dumbledore has a particular way of clapping, he does it just ever so briefly. and after the movie, we were all laughing and clapping, i noticed her clapping as how dumbledore did it. when i asked her where she learned that from, she said in the movie that guy with beard was doing it. i couldn't believe she noticed that. not bragging but very proud of her. just some feelings that i felt like sharing here and so there it is. a proud father.	❤️

how do i go about asking for a out of state job location transfer? not sure if this is the best place to ask this but i'm sure there are some pretty wise people here lol! ok, so long story short... i'm 16 and i landed my first job last month. and basically when i got hired my parents had also just *for sure* decided that they wanted the family to move across the country in august. awesome, but that makes me feel awkward since i'll only be working at said place for shy of 3 months. regardless, i was thinking of quitting that job sometime soon anyway since i realized it didn't quite fit with my morals, but that's besides the point xd so, *if* i do stay with the company, i am struggling to decide whether i should put in my two weeks when it's time and when my manager talks to me, i ask him about a location transfer -- or is there an actual proper way to do it? also.. if it would even be worth asking, since i'm really new :/ thanks in advance for any replies	😊
starting a new job tomorrow- nervous as hell after reading many posts i'm glad to know i'm not the only one that gets so anxious about starting a new job, its just so damn nerve wracking! you have to meet new people.. learn new things.. act like you're a normal human being.. ugh just so stressful, right? also this is going to be my first actual full time job so i'm entering the real adult 8-4 world. honestly, i'm probably just being over dramatic and i'll get there and it'll be fine and dandy and i'll come home and be like that wasn't so bad plus i already went through all the training but cmon i still don't really know what the fuck i'm doing.. fuck! wish me luck	😅
what would you love to receive as a birthday gift?? i began dating somebody so i guess i'm obligated to get him a gift and idek where to start. gifts seem so pointless to me sometimes but it's only because i feel like i'm not worthy of anybody's gratitude	🙃
depression really do be like that time to feel nothing i guess	😔
i (28f) am becoming very detached from my fiance (28m) because of his depression and our sex. what do i do? my post history is a shitshow, i'll try to keep this short... my fiance lost his job six months ago. last time he lost his job, he was basically possessed by depression and it was awful. i felt so sorry for him and it was very hard to support him because he could not communicate what helped and what didn't. i was afraid the same thing would happen this time, but it isn't as bad. but i do find myself caring for him more than i'd like (feels like mothering sometimes). he started using medical marijuana for panic attacks and it really works, but the smell is a huge turn off and so is him being high. i'm supportive just not into it. during sex i constantly have to ask for the very basic things i want. i feel like we have no sexual intimacy in our relationship anymore. i tried to talk to him about it but i am so emotionally removed from the relationship it came out very harsh. we've talked it out but idk how to rebuild that intimacy? i love him, but i don't feel like he wants me or cares what i want from sex anymore :( tldr; he's very depressed and so i've been helping him. it's made the relationship less sexy and i don't think he really cared about what i like during sex because i have to ask him for the basics (foreplay, kissing). i want to rebuild what we had, any advice? thank you sorry if my post seems rushed, i'm trying not to cry while he's sound asleep.	❤️
my fish died by drowning :( my fish drowned yesterday i'm speechless	😔
share your opinion hey reddit community, so there's something that's bugging me and i have mixed feelings about it so i want to see other perspectives. i'm 18, living abroad with my mother and my stepdad. towards the end of the last summer while i was in my homecountry and some stuff happened that made my mum kick me out and send me to live with my dad, causing me to miss the flight back. the situation was resolved in two weeks and i flew back home though. however, i now had a conversation with my stepdad and he said that he is still against me living with them and feels as if i should've stayed in my homecountry, even if that would've made me lose one or two years of education, he considers it wouldn't have been a loss for me. even if he's been married to my mother for 9 years, in this situation i feel excluded and that my parents are playing ping pong with me haha, but also that it's not normal for my stepdad to be like this as i've been living with my mother since day 1 and my father is not a huge parental figgure in my life (he stopped paying child support about 7 years ago). do you think it's normal? what's your opinion on this?	😊

[update] i (22f) went through my boyfriend's (30m) phone and didn't exactly like what i saw link to original post: <url> within about 48 hours of this post, i went through my boyfriend's phone again as i just didn't completely trust him. i found something way worse. i uncovered text messages sent to his friends discussing a girl (jordan) who he admitted to kissing and making out with on multiple occasions. this is not the girl who he sent the emotional text to in the original post she is different. he also admitted to having feelings for this girl. these text messages were only sent two weeks ago. as soon as i read these messages, i saw red. the messages were discussing the kiss and i couldn't find any where he had spoken to the girl directly. some of the texts (paraphrased) where "yeah we are platonic friends we just hold hands all night and make out " another one read "if i'm going to have an affair i want it to be all or nothing if i'm going to hell i want to do it right" "i kinda feel cheated that it didn't go any further than making out" he had also sent a couple of her photos to friends and stuff. i saw text messages between him and his mum and she told him to hide it and focus on being a better boyfriend. i couldn't breathe and saw red. he was having a shower and i told him to open the fucking door and i asked "who the fuck is jordan?" he told me to calm down and wait for him to get dressed. he cried a lot, i yelled, he cried some more. he said he was planning on telling me but felt awful about it he said the days where they hooked up where the worst of his life. he said he missed me (i was away when they hooked up) and felt lonely. he said he had an emotional connection with her but she now means nothing. i found that hard to believe but okay. i told him to block her and he did. he said they never had sex. he said he wanted to but he stopped himself from doing it. he wants to give us another chance and i want to give him another chance but i feel if i do i am a fucking idiot who will continue to get used over and over again. he said he wants to be a better man for me. part of me believes it. part of me can't. now here we are. he's downstairs waiting for me to come down and cuddle with him. i forgave him right now as it's easier because i booked us tickets to go to paris in two weeks and don't want to give up that trip. i think the break up is inevitable but i also still love him so much and i'm finding this all difficult to handle. i have no idea what's right here. well i do i just don't know how to. i know this post will be downvoted and people will call me stupid for even considering giving him a second chance. tldr: my boyfriend sucks he physically cheated on me 2 weeks ago. i feel broken and sad	😂
beautul says what haa gotchu	😏
per y'all's recommendation... [orphan black] after finishing 12 monkeys a couple.weeks ago, i posted a little review as i really loved it! but some of you all recommended that i watch orphan black. and i did and liked it! thought i'd post my thoughts. **orphan black:** it took me a season to get into it as i felt the first season was a bit more like semi-random thoughts that didn't quite fit together yet. but once they started to fit together and make sense next season, it had me hooked! tatiana maslany left me absolutely **speechless**!!! without a doubt she has got to be one of the top 5, if not the #1, best and most versatile actress for her age in the world. i'm really glad she won all the awards she won for that show because she basically made it a one woman show. and all her characters were drastically different and represented their origin in the world flawlessly; accent, vocabulary (patent vs. patent, words like bloody hell, or for helena she spoke broken english like a true esl individual rather than flawless english just with an accent which is something that drives me crazy with native english speaking actors playing foreign roles), customs, clothing, and so forth. she played all her roles so perfectly that they were all very uniquely different people! i really admire that and it made the show so much more interesting. props to tatiana and congrats on the well deserved awards!!! the storyline was good. i know many said season 3 was rough and not very fun. i didn't think it was bad, but definitely not the best season. i enjoyed it still. but i have to say season 4 was my favorite! orphan black is definitely going to go on my fav shows list along with *fringe* and *12 monkeys*. thank you guys for the recommendation. **but now i need a new show to watch**! i love science fiction like *fringe*, *12 monkeys*, *altered carbon*, *star trek: voyager*, *star trek: tng", and/or anything dealing with the future, cyberpunk, technology, conspiracy and complex storylines with depth, **and especially time travel**! i also enjoy cop, military, and procedural shows. like *the mentalist*, *ncis*, *seal team*, and so on; stuff like that. oh, and medical shows like *house*. so any new shows y'all can recommend??	😁

my crush wants to introduce me to her mom we've been knowing each other for about 2 months when his brother, who is my best friend, introduced me to her. i didn't feel anything about her until the 3 weeks before when we had our exams at school, and we were waiting outside. i approached her and had a good convo with her. she was smiling and blushing, and she was a bit shy, too. some days later i texted her how much i like her and asked her if she has a boyfriend. she said that she doesn't have a boyfriend but she considers me as a friend since she knows only a few things about me. i said i would like to get to know her more, so i asked her if she can meet me next day. she couldn't because her class went on a trip therefore she didn't have time for meeting. a week later the closing ceremony was held. i saw her there but unfortunately we didn't meet. i texted her after the ceremony that i would have liked to meet her there, and she answered "i would've liked meet you too, because i wanted to introduce you to my mom because i and my brother have been talking a lot about you." i asked her if we can meet during the summer (she lives on a farm kinda far away) and she said no. but she has also told me that she will introduce to her mom on the opening ceremony. p.s. she likes most of my instagram posts and she gives the heart reaction on some of my facebook posts (mostly pics that featuring me). also there was a the ask-a-question thingey on her insta and i wrote "what do you think about me? " and she answered "my loved one" with the question blocked by a sticker saying "secret".	❤️
are you a jojofag? is you are you tryna talk about part 5	😳
my ex is acting like he is still my boyfriend but is also saying he would have sex with other people me: 23 y/o female him:23 y/o male ok i know how it sounds, but hear me out y'all.... i have a hard time being sure of my feelings and decisions and always am doubting myself. my ex and i have been broken up for a few months but not acting broken up at all. he wants constantly to talk to me and be with me, we have lots of sex and lots of cuddles, all that romantic shit. he takes me out on dates a few times a week, goes out of his way for me, plenty of pda, i see his family all the time, and has admitted he's still in love with me, but doesn't want a relationship. i just tell my coworkers and family that he's still my boyfriend because it's so confusing. when we broke up he said initially he doesn't want to give me false hope and that i shouldn't be waiting for him. we established that we could see each other but have the benefits of being single.... but he's getting all the relationship benefits. i have a horrible fear of being alone which has made it hard for me to just say no to all of this. time has passed, he's gotten more boyfriendish, so i assumed he wanted to be monogamous. we haven't been with other people since our first date. i asked him the other day if he would potentially have sex with other people on his vacation this week. he said "maybe, i don't know, i can't predict the future" then proceeded to tell me that i ruined his day, he looked like he was gonna cry, didn't talk to me for an hour. i was pissed. more sad and shocked than pissed but i was visibly upset. i know now he wouldn't have sex with other people, he just wanted to say that to reestablish we are not together. am i an asshole for asking that question? is he an asshole for acting like this?? what the fuck do i do tl;dr my ex is acting like he is still my boyfriend and i'm conflicted about everything	😭

leaving ice cream out... so i serve at a restaurant (or did) until i left ice cream out. i was being very attentive taking care of my tables. one had ordered ice cream... so after being in the walk in for five minutes to find the type of ice cream the costumer order i ran back to the front scooped it fast and planned on dropping off the ice cream and returning to the server station to clean up. however i can kind of get gold fish memory when i have multiple task i have to perform. well my table asked for something making me think of my other table that moved outside. so i ran out there immediately after to check on them. they happened to be ready for their checks. so i'm running inside to ask the manager to edit their ticket for our happy hour.... as i'm walking to the office i hear a coworker complaining about the ice cream. still in a hurry i stop briefly just to inform her it was me, i was taking care of my table and planned on putting it up. the walked right off to the office to continue working.... then come back out the office to print my tickets. (assuming the ice cream is up since someone was so concerned..) anyways i'm walking back over and she is still bitching at this point. and yes the ice cream was up... as i walked by i said, "really? you're still talking about it?" (which i regret) i guess i didn't realize how pissed this girl actually was. and i'm sorry but i really don't care and will not rationalize her flipping out over ice cream... this girl went off and all i said after that was, "guess the ice cream is coming out your paycheck?"... she mouthed off and i ignored it. took tickets out to my tables and came back still confused over everything that just happened... everything being this girl freaking out... well i've been at this restaurant for five years... i know all about coworkers getting into stupid fights at work. so i decide to go over there an apologize.... thinking that would be the end of it right? oh nooooo far from the truth! she goes off on me... at this point i call it a lost cause and walk off. up to the front i go to forget about it... hahaha forget?! yeah right... the bartender happened to see me apologize and saw how mad the other girl was. i'm telling you it was all so crazy and unnecessary that i was not letting it get to me and was choosing to i guess down play(?) the situation... well the bartender did ask me what happened and i did start to inform her.. the way i was telling her you would think i was just a person that witnessed it rather than was involved. i wasn't mad at the other girl. i was remaining understanding to having a bad night considering this wasn't her typical behavior... well this girl comes around the corner and goes off.... and i simple look at her and inform her no one is talking shit. no one was... i then get called a whore and slut and told she wants to punch me in the face. i ignore her and continue my conversation with the bartender /bestfriend... and the other girls yelling continues. i remaining ignoring her... then she walks up right behind me yelling... the boss was out at this point. telling us to stop even though it was her.. she kept yelling and we got fired... moral of the story. put shit up and excuse any mistakes. i'm not a writer by any means.	😔
life detox in a few months, i'll be moving to a forestry town in the pnw and getting my own apartment, a samoyed, and starting my new life as a single 21 year old working woman. i'm slowly dwindling down in weight and i feel healthier than i have in over a year. a few days ago, i also cut out my ex finally and for the last time. i told him i was done. simple as that. but i was done with the hurt, the gaslighting, and the way that he took his truly selfish actions and twisted them to somehow be that he was doing a good thing. and i don't miss him this time. and i feel good. i deactivated my instagram and my facebook. i want to see what life just looks like for me. i also canceled a date that likely would've been a one night stand leaving me empty, and i deleted tinder too. and now i'm just reading and learning what it means to feel whole again. and to my future husband, whoever you are- i can't wait to meet you. seriously. you'll be everything and more- not perfect but perfect for me. i'm getting myself ready to just be a happy person, and you'll catch me at my best time, and i will give you the entire world	❤️
about men. my co-worker she said men are such a jerk . don't trust em. was that is true ...maybe or yes it is .	🤔

strip club after a date i [21 f] just got home from a date with a guy [26 m] and the first thing i see on his snap is what i think a strip club. i text him playfully saying "so you blew me off for the club" and he replied "my friends picked me up" and i then replied with "have fun ". this was our first date and we met off tinder. i had high hopes for him as i think our date went really well. needless to say i don't want this type of guy in my life. but how would you feel after this? i'm kinda upset, i liked him but obviously our lives are completely different. tl;dr: first date, guy went to strip club after	😊

destroying both my feet i'm still kind of in shock over how this occurred and how quickly things can change. i do have a newfound appreciation for recognizing the things we (i) take for granted. sitting on the couch last night, cross legged, reading "the secret life of trees" got up to make more tea and felt my ankle was "a bit" asleep. thought nothing of it and took a step forward. immediately buckled down to the floor and heard a loud "snap". instant pain. totally confident something was broken. this was not just a sprain or something transient. this was serious. i vocalize. husband wakes from a dead sleep and runs out to the living room, thinking someone has broken into our home and is attacking me. nope. it's ok, "no big deal" i say. it's like midnight, and i'm not going to the er for this. elevate and apply cold. go to bed. wake up and go to the doctor. suspects a sprain but advises rads to be safe. takes my blood pressure and it's elevated - this is concerning and i should get rechecked. medical-related anxiety attack (that was somehow held at bay until this point) initiated. i walk to the x-ray clinic. it's in the same building as a pharmacy. it's raining and i don't know where i'm going, i can't bear any weight on my right foot, and i'm feeling super alone. everyone i've reached out to is busy or away (granted i didn't communicate the full situation to them as to not pull them away from important tasks). i open the door to the pharmacy. it's heavy and made of metal and cuts into my pinky toe on my other foot (wearing flip flops). the baby toe becomes wedged between the cement outside and the metal door frame. i pull my food out and there's blood everywhere. i just start crying. like, really crying. after a few minutes i try to compose myself and limp into the pharmacy. i stand there as people are coming and going, looking at me like i'm just insane (wet, flip flops in the rain, can't walk on one foot, bleeding profusely from the other, obviously just was/is crying etc). finally got to the radiology office. the tram was amazing and so kind. confirmed the fracture and treated the laceration on my other foot. referred to emergency for casting +/- sutures. call a friend to drive me, because i don't feel it's prpbably safe to drive with two mangled feet (especially in a standard) and a, to put it gently, fragile mental state. get to er. my friend is amazing. my bp was actually lower at emerg than at the gp, all because of her. had to concertedly explain to every health care professional who assisted me that i had two separate injuries, on each foot. er team were making jokes about how "it's not even 11am yet" etc. luckily, no surgery likely needed. all seems good. got a boot for my broken foot, and sutures in my other foot. was suppose to run an 8k race this weekend...not going to happen. newfound appreciation for the thibgs we take for granted (ie- walking). i feel like i'm still kind of in shock, as to how this mess so quickly manifested. there is certainly an element of humour though, to this which i can appreciate. tl:dr - just be really careful! if you ever think your foot might be asleep, check it first before putting your entire body weight on it, and breaking your foot, and having an anxiety attack, and lacerating your other foot, and ending up in the hospital with the staff laughing at you (i say this with love - they were all amazing!)	❤️
ordering an uber and getting into some rando's car. tl;dr: two women order an uber and get into a random car without getting murdered. a couple of years ago, my work sent me to jacksonville, fl for a couple of weeks...just ahead of hurricane matthew. these fuckers had no evacuation plans and no contingency plan. as it happens, i've been through 4 hurricanes and knew how to prepare. my coworker and i took an uber to walmart, just as the clouds started getting darker and rolling in kind of fast. we ran into the store and grabbed a few essentials. i ordered the uber when we got to the checkout. by the time we exited the store, it was down pouring. the app said the driver was in a nissan altima. i followed the little car indicator on the app and it showed the car was very close. just then, a nissan altima stopped in front of us and rolled down the passenger window. my friend and i ran to the car. me: "are you miguel?" driver: "yes." so we jumped into the backseat of his car...which had stuff in it. at this point, we began to realize something wasn't right. friend: "do you work for uber?" driver, in very broken english: "yes, i work. i work from home." me: "are you here to give us a ride?" driver: "yes. i give you ride. how much?" this guy had to have been in his 60's. i didn't recognize his accent. if i had to guess, i'd say it was persian. my friend and i apologized to the driver and got out of the car. the real miguel in a newer nissan altima pulled up behind the imposter miguel's car. thankfully, we weren't murdered and / or something worse. jax isn't exactly the place you want to be jumping into random cars. it wasn't until later that i thought about what the driver must have been thinking. the poor old man probably thought he was being carjacked when we first jumped into his car.	😂
what's the weirdest thing someone has said to you during a conversation? from my late teens to my mid 20's, i spent a lot of time in and out of the hospital, due to a disease that had went undiagnosed for too long and caused me major anxiety and panic attacks, and almost a massive heart attack. before i knew what was going on with me, i had taken yet another trip to urgent care in between visits with my nurse practitioner, who wasn't the one that found my real issue since she never did any exams or tests on me. but anyway, i had my mom with me and so i know i was not imagining how the conversation with the male nurse went as she heard it, too. he comes in the room i'm in and starts with the usual questioning to find out what is going on with me, only it took a weird turn. he asked me if i was pregnant (standard question, nothing odd there.) and when i said no, he asked me as serious as could be, "why not?". now, it took me a while to find words, as i couldn't believe my ears. my brain was scrambled enough due to how stressed and exhausted i was, that i instantly started laughing, because i didn't know what else to do or say since no other person in the medical field had ever asked me why i was not pregnant, at which point he got a bit upset at me and repeated the question. i don't remember what kind of answer i had put together, but after he had left the room, i asked my mom if what just happened was real and she confirmed that he seriously asked me why i wasn't pregnant after i answered no to the question asking if i was. to this day, i still laugh about it. it was so out of the ordinary.	😂

repost from r/relationship_advice long story... it's kind of a long story. me(28m), met this woman(f27) over 10 years ago. we we're just kids. we were both into each other as teens but because of the strict religion we we're involved in, we never expressed our attraction to each other until later, though. and while nothing came of it because of distance and other factors, we stayed very close friends. about 7 years ago, she was kicked out of our religion. and as per the rules, i didn't speak to her after that. i hated it but i was pretty much in a cult and believed it 100%. so i followed the rules and cut off communication. fast forward. 3 years ago i realize i'm in a cult. my religion is wrong. the first person i reach out to is her. we pick up like we never stopped. since then, for 3 years, we've talked pretty regularly. only over text or social media or phone calls, since there is some distance between us. and my old feelings started to come back. about a month ago, i told her so. and she let me down gently that she didn't feel that way about me and didn't think she would. so i've been trying to get over that and still be a good friend to her. mind you, we haven't been together in person in 10 years. that changed last night. she happened to be coming to the city i'm working in for her birthday. her, and a couple close family members. so last night for the first time in a decade, we got to see each other again. she hugged me like an old friend at first sight, then gave all things in her hands to a family member and jumped into my arms, full on cheesy legs around my ass, arms around my neck and just hung there. for awhile. then we went to hear some live music. she stood next to me, touching my arm from time to time. danced against me(i'm not a big dancer). when riding in an uber from place to place, we'd usually be separated by one person, but she'dreach behind them to put her hand on my shoulder and just touch me. little side note: i had to work the next day and be up at 530 am. around 11, her sister asks me if i'll hang with them for the night cause it would mean a lot to the main character of this experience. of course i agreed. i'm keeping things strictly friendly. she told me she's not interested, so i don't want to encroach on any boundaries. after a few drinks, we all decide to go back to their hotel for drinks and games. we just played stupid games and drank beer until nearly 4am. it was great. but i had to go at least take a nap before work and excuse myself to call an uber and go back to my hotel on the other side of town. my friend says she'll walk me out. we get in the elevator, and her party face goes away and it's like a guard drops. she tells me i'm just how she remembered. we exit the elevator and walk outside the hotel. she hugs me and says i can hold her til the uber gets there. he pulls up not too much later and she let's go, looks up at me, and jumps into my arms again. i'm kind of taken aback cause my driver is just staring at us and i didn't expect it. she held on to me for awhile. maybe 20 seconds. we said our goodbyes and i walked to the uber. she watched me leave until i was out of sight. even my driver made a few comments about how it seemed like leaving her was a big deal... this morning i got an invite to hang out with them tonight again since they leave tomorrow morning. keep in mind it's just 3 women and myself. i'm obviously going to go, but i'm not sure how to act. growing up in a cult has meant that my dating game is limited to cult experience. and dating is super different in the cult than out. am i just reading into things, or is she giving me signals and wanting me to act on them? i'm trying to be respectful of what she's told me just a few weeks ago. help please. tl;dr : developed feelings for a long time friend over long distajce, wasn't reciprocated. now in person, i'm getting mixed signals and don't know what to think.	😅

everyone in my house has the flu except me. i had an excess amount of energy today and i made a really nice meal in the instant pot i got for christmas and i baked a caramel pecan pie but my husband was too sick to eat it. for a brief idiotic moment i was like, poor me all this food and no one to eat it and all this energy and no one to hang out with. i don't deserve my precious sweet family, haha! i was mostly joking to myself in my head but still i honestly felt sorry for myself for a second. has anyone else had a similar "poor me" situation before you realized you were being a butt?	😳

got inside the wrong car like most tifus,it wasnt yesterday, this one happened like two weeks ago. i got out of the house and wanted to drive to a friends house. after i got down i fumbled with the remote for the car and it seems that its working poorly again (had some probs in the past), but i managed to open the door. got in and noticed that it feels weird, cant find the pad where i input the password and the key doesnt fit, and then i saw that on the weel had "ford" on it, brain loading, i have a honda.... i exit the car and realize, its not my car! my car is two cars away and some stranger just forgot to lock his car, wasnt even high but confused as fuck. fortunetly no one noticed tl;dr got inside a car that wasnt mine by mistake and tried to steal it by accident.	😀
no thoughts, head empty idk what to shitpost	😔
tifu by accidentally (nearly) castrating my lover. so my lover enjoys a bit of rough play. he especially enjoys it when i use a coat hanger to smack his ass red. i am a pastor irl so it helps to be an alter in the bedroom. i am "bishop" when i am in the bedroom. my lover gets down on his knees and.. the lord only knows what goes on behind the closed doors. the smacking got really vigorous and rough. at one point his ass was like two mounds of strawberry jelly just wobbling away. with every whip there was a gasp and begging for more. he's a glutton for punishment and i don't mind dishing it out. my arms were getting pretty tired smacking so i decided i wanted to move on to phase two of the lovefest. he was having none of it. he wanted to be smacked a few more times. i began smacking him really fast and hard, hoping he would give me our safe word. i beat and smacked his ass faster than a washing machine. i circled my arms at full speed, coat hanger in hand, swinging like a wind turbine. next minute i heard a sickening "squelch" and a spray of what i can only describe as blood and fluid squirt up into my face. i pulled the coat hanger without thinking and my lover screamed at the top of his lungs. i feel a bit selfish in saying this but i told him to shut the fuck up, as the motel we were staying in had a strict policy on noise and having hotel guests staying over without signing in to confirm and pay a fee. the blood and fluid was spraying across the room. his eyes was rolling back in his head. i looked down at his dick and retched. the hanger entered his ball from behind and when i pulled it, i ripped the sack and a portion of his man hole skin. what looked like liver and onion pate was coming out of his behind. i retched again. he was passed out. i just rang 911 and left. i'm married so i think he will understand why i left.. i think.. tl : dr: lover enjoys rough play. i got impatient, smacked him hard with a coat hanger, ended up making mince meat of his sack. rang emergency and left him there cos i'm married.	🤔
walked out of a tattoo shop this would've been my 7th tattoo - an extremely small one for a friend of mine who passed almost a month ago. i went to a shop that i've heard good things about, but not my usual shop. i went in and told them what i wanted. i kept changing the size because i wanted it really small. the guy kept getting frustrated that i wanted it changed and didn't even know how to work the printer! then his coworkers that were there were convincing me that i wouldn't want it any smaller and that no one ever says that they wished they got one of their tattoos smaller. i understand some things with a tattoo can't be done if it's extremely small, but they were not working with me at all - and kept looking at me weird. so i walk to the back and they only have one table and the place isn't even decorated real nice. so i walk back to the front and sign papers and they ask for the money up front... i stuttered and said i'm sorry but i don't think i want this done anymore and left... and they all looked at me crazy. i just thought it was weird that they had only one table and wanted payment first. at my usual place the guys are so friendly and they let you pay afterwards even with walk in, unless it's a deposit. my place also is always booked up and has multiple tables. but when i went in there, they were just waiting for business. my boyfriend was with me and i said i just didn't feel good about that place and he said good, because i felt weird about it too. i didn't get the tattoo, but i will get it probably next sunday added to my tattoo i will be getting that day already at my usual shop! i'm probably being high maintenance about this but it was just an extremely sketchy environment to me, which is weird bc i've heard all good things. they were extremely rude, especially to someone who just has a friend pass.	🙃

i won't allow myself to be surprised on christmas im 14 years old and i have only ever been surprised on christmas with like a few gifts.my birthday i could care less about i actually feel like its a waste of time because congrats you were born literally every one you know was born.so yea birthdays are pointless to me why do i deserve a present for being born?i mean it would make sense for my mother to get a present on my birthday because that was probably painful.but me idk anyway christmas is my favorite holiday i absolutely love christmas.it is truly the most wonderful time of the year .i love giving gifts and receiving gifts.it is amazing.but the only thing is that i literally will not allow myself to be surprised on christmas and i think it has gotten to a extreme level.no one knows that i do this stuff.i just cant stop its like i most know what im getting it kills me not to know.just so you understand how crazy i have become here is the thing i do every year to discover weeks before christmas what im getting.i have figured out my dads laptop password, my moms , my grandmas , my brothers, and my sisters phone password.i have figured my dads, moms, and grandmas amazon account passwords.i know every spot that they hide wrapped/ not wrapped yet gifts.also if there is a present underneath the christmas tree for me i will stay up until midnight then very strategically open it and see what it is then wrap it back up.and no one is even suspecting of even trying to know what im getting at the smallest extent.some presents from other people i don't usually know what im getting but i don't really care because they are usually small gifts that they just happened to find out by "them selves" that i like.so i usually have a 75% chance of knowing what they got me.i have done these things since i was 7 years old.but lately christmas has become dull because on christmas morning i have to pretend to be surprised even though i know everything that im getting.but i just cant stop my brain tells me don't do it not this year.but my body says otherwise.now its a week before christmas and here is what im getting.... 1.) 4 $10 itunes gift cards 2.) night and day time face wash 3.) other face cleaner 4.) mini mouse phone case 5.) red and grey snow jacket 6.) buddy the elf vinyl figure 7.) black f.r.i.e.n.d.s shirt 8.) pink grey cloth leggings 9.) pink grey and white camo blanket 10.)pink blue, black, and white t-shirt 11.) pink perriwinkle sweater 12.)$25 itunes gift card 13.)airpods 14.)iphone 7 plus 15.)pack of earrings 16.)pack of earrings 17.)pack of earrings 17.)red phone case 18.)silver popsocket 19.)a bunch of clothes 20.)molly burke merch: pink sweatshirt 21.)molly but merch: mr.whisker cap 22.)curling iron and once again just like that i have ruined christmas for myself, my favorite holiday	❤️

my girlfriend broke up with me yesterday i was having some very very bad post nut clarity like i was on the verge of suicide. i texted her and then she started saying some comforting shit and that and i appreciate it but i was too deep in my feels to really accept it. i then said some dumb shit. i said 'not everyone can cope with people hating them' or something along those lines and she took it personally. i didn't want her to be angry at me so i said talk to me tomorrow. i messaged her earlier and i apologised too much. then she said i dont think this is working. i panicked and started crying and asked what she meant. she said she wanted to break up with me. i begged her to stay to the point where i was pathetic (well i still am but) and then she said bye and stopped replying and now i'm sat here trying my best to be happy. i don't blame her it's a surprise she was able to cope with me this long and i knew this would eventually happen but i didn't expect it to hurt this much. i was completely in the wrong and i deserve it so i dont know why i'm complaining. what the fuck is wrong with me?	🙃
anyone else born on april fools day? the closest birthday i've met is april 2nd- heck i was supposed to be born that day as well, but guess i wanted out early ... and made a literal fool of myself! ok it is sort of fun that new people i meet tend to be like "huh?? that's a joke right?" when i tell them. i read one story how someone's dad missed their birth because he thought his wife giving birth was a prank. anyways it can be a bit annoying though when you're the perfect target of all the pranks on that day... so let's share the pain a lil- who else is an april fool?	🙄

my dad really knows how to ruin everyone's day i woke up this morning, i was shirtless because i was on my way to the garage to cut my hair (i have a buzz cut so i cut it myself, it's getting a lil longer than i'd like). so i walk over to the garage from my room, greet them and as im going in the garage he goes "put on a shirt, it's cold out there". i just said "it's ok i'm just cutting my hair" (who tf wears a shirt when they're cutting their own hair it gets all itchy). to him, me just saying that was a "disrespectful rebuttal". as i walk away to go get a shirt him and my step mom are arguing over it and the morning is ruined because they're all pissed off at each other, and i'm just confused.	😎
hihihi, i'm bored and wanna chat (16f) dm meeeeee, please don't be a perv!	🥺
accountability buddies, anyone? sometimes it's difficult to just get things done without anyone there to motivate and encourage. if you want someone to hold you accountable on your goals or be nice and supportive, you can join our group on telegram!! we keep a check on each other and are super, super supportive of each other. the idea is to create an environment where we can talk about things that we can't talk about with anyone else. dm me for the group link! have a nice day/night!	😊
by i'm in high school (currently 17), and i'm currently writing a research paper regarding the effects of the perry expedition on the japanese revolution. i went to a history teacher who is supposedly informed on japan to ask for help, and showed him the document i was working on just on my computer, and he opened up an online resource for books. he just clicked on the search bar, and the stuff that popped up was as follows: "rhinoplasty" "male rhinoplasty" "cost of hair transplant in trenton (my home town) vs \[where i currently live\]" "black pill" "jaw implants medpor vs silicone" "hate life but don't want to die" (and a bunch of generally messed up, and plastic surgery related stuff - the suggestions dropped down half the page for some reason. i think it's the auto-form recovery chrome addon that did it). and the like. a bunch of dumb, plastic-surgery related stuff. i noticed his hesitation and he didn't say anything, luckily. all i can say is it wasn't funny while it was happening... had he said something, i don't know what i'd have done. there's no doubt he noticed, though. at least i can point out that the online resource he linked me to was illegal if anything comes up, so we're all in the wrong here tl;dr - teacher used my computer, typed something in the bar, and all the fucked up recommendations from my three or four years of being a tortured incel popped up.	😎

weirdest day of my life so i have woken up at 6am, took a shower, ate, then around 9am i boarded a plane & had a 20 minute plane ride to another town to see a cardiologist about my heart, now i'm stranded in a hot ass hotel & i'm stuck here for another few days without anyone & not even a cup of water. fucken hell someone kill me.	😐
i've had a thing for my close friend for a year and it only seems to get stronger met him in university, we were living on the same floor in our dorm building and had similar classes because we were in the same program (but we never actually ever hungout in class - if we saw each other we'd smile but that's it) so we saw each other at the same time each day due to schedules just aligning. we always said hi, sometimes a little conversation here and there but always smiled or said hey. i loved it. he made me feel so at ease and comfortable. he is a little socially awkward but it's actually endearing. i feel like it's something that makes people like him so much if you get me. anyway long story short we just started becoming better friends during exam season last year (literally december 2019) and then got really close during the 2nd semester (started jan 2020) until the pandemic really hit and everyone was in lockdown mid-march. we stayed in touch of course, but spending lots of time with each other at the beginning of the year confirmed my feelings for him and i knew it was real because when i told our mutual friends about my crush, i started to like him even more. we have gotten closer with our 2nd year being online (sept 2020) and while we did talk in the summer, it was only a few times a month cause he was so busy working and all. when school started we would talk to each other at least 6 days a week. so we grew closer with each discord call (lmao) and stayed there for hours. we had periods where we didn't talk for like 20 minutes, but having that person on the other side was very comforting, i imagine for both of us.. as he literally told me that if we couldn't discord everyday he would kill himself lmao (online sciool had made us say things we never thought were in us. it's been shitty man). but omg i want him so much. i know we wouldn't actually work out long term because we have different core values and want different things at the end of the day, but right now i want him so bad. i know our friendship isn't worth sacrificing so i know it probably won't happen, but i can't ever stop imagining him holding me when i feel sad and upset or him doing other things to me. you know what i'm talking about. i know i want him because literally every time i get high, i think about how much i want him. and i've been getting high a lot recently because i'm on christmas break and this is something i need after the pain of those last 3 months. anyway... i just wanted to share that. would love to see anyone's thoughts or opinions on this, esp after i sober up	😂
while i was teaching today my classroom's computer burst into flames. oh, also at the age of 23 i can now say i bought a house! i did not think i'd start my work day by turning on a computer, telling my client to open their book to page 23, and then five minutes later having a small bonfire for them to enjoy. luckily we have good staff at our company so they helped put it out. my odd work story aside, i can say as a young woman of 23 years i just bought my very first house and car, i thought i'd share with you guys my accomplishments because i'm too worried to share it with my friends, the first person i told initially outside of my family were my best friends when i went for a trip back to nz, they were talking about one of their friends and how successful they were with their partner and how they had just bought a house and i sheepishly said that i had just bought a house and car too all by myself, she responded by saying that it didn't count and that it wasn't that impressive or amazing... so yeah, that kinda sucked haha, i didn't want the same thing to happen again so i held off telling anyone else. i work three jobs and i try damn hard in life to do as best as i can, i kinda wished my friends hadn't reacted that way... oh well, hopefully someone on here will pat me on the head as a reward for my efforts haha. i only have one goal left that i want and that's to find a partner who's very career driven and hard-working too but i find that's actually harder than getting the house and car i guess tldr; i put on my big girl pants and bought a house and a car and my friends didn't want to say anything nice/dismissed it after i shared the news with them, can you guys be my friends and slap a gold sticker on my forehead and tell me i did a good job? either that or maybe tell me something funny that happened at work because i love hilarious work stories.	😂
i feel like an anime character my brother tried to slap on the knee while i wasn't looking. my arm then went with a will of its own to stop to his attack a block his arm. after i blocked him i knew he was in shock! thinking 'gaa! how did he stop my attack!? my arm was flinging at 80kph! how could he possibly block that speed!' about 2 seconds later he slapped my knee with his other hand. but it still felt awesome ! but it was actually him "teaching" me on how block attacks since he always does that kind of annoying shit to me and now i'm developing an instant reflex to block attacks. and it works too if classmates start poking me i can stop them so they know i'm a force not to be reckoned with! thx bro [to the people who actually went out of their way to read this, thank you]	😎
i just made a mistake. but not. and it's frequent. i just made an inappropriate comment on someone's photograph. and it was suggestive of depression and suicidal feelings. and tbh i have been secretly suicidal in my past; but i'm alive so... i guess i'm fine . but, with this comment it came back again. it's... it's not that it went away completely. it was and it is. but i'm not comfortable being a trigger. i'm not ashamed or anything but i was mocked and threatened by a friend. so... i feel secluded. i want to be able to talk about life from the perspective of 'not a big deal if you want to give it away' sorts. i don't know. if you are able to see through these lines. please let your opinion reach me.	🙄
tifu stealing and breaking a kids gift half an hour ago i told my bf that the new mug i got from his dad broke last night. he says what? that mug is the one his son wanted. oh great. backstory, bf's dad dropped of some gifts the other day as i was leaving for work. he excitedly says pick out a travel mug for yourself, there are a few in the bag. i was running late so i said thx will look at them next time i'm over. a few days ago i see three new travel mugs on the coffee table. one has princess crowns so i figure he meant that one would be for me since i'm the only girl. when i pick it up i laugh to see on the other side a picture of grumpy cat. i love it. after using it a few days i text bf's dad saying thank you i love the grumpy cat and it keeps my coffee nice and hot. he says there were lots of neat mugs there.... last night i dropped it while empty. no big deal, filled it up again and suddenly a sharp piece of plastic embedded my finger, i look and one side is completely cracked. darn it. now i need to replace the mug for bf's son and i can't find it online anywhere. (sold out) i asked his dad where he got it but no reply yet. with my luck it was at a kiosk closed after xmas. reddit please help me find a new one! it's a 15oz stainless steel travel mug "don't tell me to calm down" with a pic of grumpy cat tl:dr broke a mug meant for my bf's son and can't find a replacement need help	😔

being lazy and having to go to the hospital this happened while i was 8 (not today, ). i was about to go to the park with my nanny, and i had the urge to go poo. well, stupid 8 year old me didn't know that i could sit on the toilet and play my nintendo dsi at the same time, so i pretended to poo instead. later that day, i had intense stomach pains and had to go to the emergency room because my parents thought i had appendicitis. it ended up being a huge log jam from the crap i held in earlier. needless to say, my parents forced me to go to the bathroom before we went anywhere for months. tl;dr 8 year old me was too lazy to just take a shit, so i had to go to the emergency room and my parents were pissed	😅
letting my friend borrow my phone in class, leading to me getting grilled by the principal and 2 police officers oh jeez, this is gonna be long but i hope you get some enjoyment out of it so this happened a couple months back in high school, and me and my friend (i'll call him josh) were sitting in class just talking, not doing work cause the period ends in like 3 mins. we're just on our phones and i recently got a new one, and he asked to see it. i gave it to him locked (idk in case he goes in some apps or shit) and let him play around with it, look at it, etc. with confidence that nothing can happen since it's locked. as you'll soon see, i was dead wrong. so 30s maybe 1min goes by, and i look over at josh, see him just swiping around on the lockscreen etc. then he goes into emergency dialer and i see him start to type in a phone number. i just glance at it and i don't recognize the first 4-5 digits that he's typed in, so i'm like who're you calling? and he replies my dad and laughs, so i'm just like "ok lmao". i do some other stuff for like a minute, and my friend gives it back to me, still on the lockscreen. as i swipe up to enter my pin, i notice the text that says emergency dialer has changed to something along the lines of "resume call" or something telling me a call is going on. i'm like what how is it calling your dad from emergency dialer, i thought that only allows calling the emergency number?! he's like idk and were laughing about it saying stuff like "wtf resume call and it's in emergency dialer what" because at that time i still thought he called his dad's number since that's what i saw him start to enter. i unlock my phone, look around, and nothing says a call is in progress. open dialer, no history, no notification, etc. then i start getting a call from "private number". still having not put 2 and 2 together, i decline, thinking it's just a scammer. i get it again, and again decline. the bell rings for that class, and i get up and leave to head to my next class. i'm in the hallway walking and i get the call again, so i'm like whatever may as well answer to see what it is. (remember this is in the span of like 4 mind since i gave my friend my phone) i hit answer and put the phone up to my ear and i hear > **police, how may i help you** i freak the fuck out for some reason and my immediate reaction is to hang up. extremely stupid now that i look back on it, but ya know, i panicked and once i had hung up i'm sure as hell not calling them back. i sit down in my next class and i tell one of my friends "yo josh was using my phone and it said emergency dialer resume call and i'm like wtf lmaoo what is this" and that kind of stuff and we're laughing. i turn off my phone (i guess my reasoning was oh i don't want them to track me or something cause again stupid and this whole thing has passed in about 5 mins and i answered like a minute ago so i'm still like wtf is this what do i do). are they gonna call me down or something? sure enough, 2 minutes later, my teacher comes up to me and is like "oh you need to go down to the office" and i immediately know what this is about, but i'm not worried cause i didn't do shit. i'll just go down there, explain what happened, maybe tell me to handle it better next time, but then take things up with josh. nope. not what happens at all. i get to the office and the principal's there along with 2 other police offers. the principal says oh please come into my office and i sit down on the chair with 2 police officers standing around me. i don't remember what they said but i launch into my explanation, saying basically what i've just wrote above. i give them the name of the person who i was with cause tbh if they knew it was me in 5 mins they'll probably know who the other person was as well. every couple sentences maybe they're stopping me, taking apart my story saying oh you did this, you did that, what do you mean you did that, etc. i get through the whole thing and the principal starts taking with the police officer saying so what do you think it is, and the police officer is like oh we know it's a prank call. i'm immediately like wtf no i know that's stupid to prank call the police and like i had no intention of doing that. the principal tells me that my story isn't believable / doesn't add up. i clarify a few things that she tries to say i did (but the principal just heard the story wrong) and she's like yea right still skeptical. then one of the police officers turned to me and said ok so we have a recording of you and someone else joking about calling the police, saying you'll do it as a prank. fuck no i never said that. of course i don't say that to them but i'm like well idk what to say cause that's definitely not the truth, i never said anything like that. the principal continues on and on, as well as the police officers trying to get me to admit it, saying oh we know it was a prank, we have a recording of you and someone else saying you're going to do that. i'm like legit all i did was give my friend my phone and then this happened in like 4 mins. the principal then says oh you had like 20 minutes when you hung up why didn't you tell a teacher, they could have dealt with it, etc and i'm like "i legit had like 5 minutes from when i gave him my phone and when i got called down, and less from when i knew it was the police. she's like oh ok and after telling them i legit didn't do anything they let me go. i get home and my parents are like oh the principal called me, she wants me and you to come see her in her office tomorrow morning. im like aight bettttt and we go there tomorrow morning and my parents and the principal just talk. then my parents are like oh you said there was a recording of them saying they'll call as a prank but my kid denies it, so can we hear it. she responds oh i don't have it, i just listened to it. then my parents are like who has it and she says the police. then my parents say can you get the recording and she says it's not really her job. so my parents say what's a number we can call them at, and she says oh i can't give their number but i can give their extension. starts to write it down and then changes her mind nevermind you can just call the public police number, i don't know if they would like me to give out their phone extension. the principal tells me ok so you don't think you deserve punishment and i'm like yea not at all since i didn't do anything and surprisingly enough she lets me go. my friend josh tells me all he got was 2 detentions, nothing else. my parents believe me and they never end up calling the police to try and get the 'recording' because they realize i'm not retarded enough to try and prank call the police. **tl;dr:** let my friend borrow my phone, friend ends up calling 911 i guess, school and police track me down in minutes somehow, and try to get me to admit shit i didn't do with a supposed 'recording' that they didn't play to me either. parents believe me, friend only gets 2 detentions. so i guess it all worked out in the end. :p	😂
can someone point me towards really racist/cultish media/subs? ok, don't jump to conclusions. i'm a social scientist with an extracurricular interest in cult behavior and explicit racism (i think there is a relationship between these). i've heard that reddit is the main platform for these types of people and groups. can anyone point out where to look? even if it's off reddit. seriously, i'm not a racist.	😂

bf m (30) calls me (f24) heavy and also makes comments about other fat people my bf keeps saying stuff like i am heavy or the other day we were hugging and he literally said my calves were bigger than his. we just had a big fight coz of this yesterday. he is all into fitness and he doesn't understand my battle with eating disorders. i was fucking anorexia a few years back. destroyed my health and later picked up bed. i was also bullied all through school even though my bmi was normal etc. i totally grew up thinking i was fat even though i wasn't and today i am over weight (thanks to bed and post anorexic weight gain). it is so triggering but he doesn't understand how it affects me and randomly fat shames people. when i confront him about his comments on me, he also te lls me the problem is in my head and it's coz i have a problem with how i look. i have tried telling him several times my issues with anxiety, depression and weight but me talking about it just triggers him. he has suffered from unhealthy weight gain for a short period in life and that's when he got into fitness. this was a few years ago. he comes from a very poor background and he really worked hard and is pretty established now. so problems like bullying, anxiety all seem pretty first world to him. he knows i am trying to get into an mma class etc for fitness and his tone is more condescending than encouraging. it's like he believes in tough love and my mental health issues aren't really valid. he is hardly listens to my problems with anxiety, depression etc but i don't feel like even pushing it further on him coz i have seen him get triggered i to a panic attack. his unwillingness to listen or understand is bothering me and i can't stand his attitude and talk about my weight or others. i really don't know what to do tl;dr bf thinks it's okay fat shaming. will he even understand what's fundamentally wrong? how i communicate my troubles?	😭

i (f/25) feel like my fiance (m/26) might still loves his ex, what should i do? first if all: i'm sorry for my bad english, i'm from another country hence i'm not able to express my feelings perfectly. but i still need advice. i don't know someone i can talk about this with. thank you my fiance (26) and i (f/25) are together for three years and we get along super good. we plan to get married and i feel genuinely loved by him. but at the same time i feel like he loved his ex more. he used to be in a very bad 2 year relationship with his ex, who was his first love/girlfriend, and their relationship ended on very bad terms since she cheated on him several times. a year or so after their breakup we started dating. i do feel loved by him and he wants to marry me and he always assures me that he has no feelings whatsoever left for his ex yet he doesn't remember some of our dates (including our first date) while he does remember so many things and dates with and about his ex. sometimes i just feel that he may loved her more than he loves me. maybe he loves her even now. i don't know but it confuses me so much... he treats me good and tells me that he loves me but i have such a hard time accepting that he might love another woman more. i'm scared of the thought that i might get married to a man who wanted to spend is life with another woman. am i overreacting? am i even childish for thinking this way? have you ever experienced something like this? should i hang on to our relationship and cherish the love he has for me or should i rather marry a man who gives me the feeling that i'm the only woman he loves. i'm not sure anymore whether i can be happy getting married to him but at the same time he never have me a reason to leave him since he treats me in such a respectful manner and with true love. tl: i feel like my fiance might still love his ex (even more than me maybe?) even though he denies it. should i really marry him feeling this way?	❤️

forgetting to clean up after doing my manly deed a short time ago while getting ready in the bathroom, i had a manly urge. i grabbed a hand towel and sat on the toilet to do my thing. as i was about to finish, i dropped my towel on the floor. knowing that i couldn't grab and reposition the towel in time, but also not wanting to make a mess all over the place, i searched my brain for a contingency plan and settled on lunging for the tub a couple of steps away and finishing in there. in hindsight, i could have just finished in the toilet but it is what it is. anyway, i did my thing and proceeded along with my morning routine, thinking nothing further of it. a few minutes later, realizing that i hadn't run the shower to rinse it down the drain and not wanting a family member to encounter it later on, i returned to the bathroom to do that. next thing i know, in runs my cat, thinking i was going to run the faucet to let her have a drink, and hops right into the tub and prances around in my puddle of jizz in anticipation. i feel like a depraved human being. tl;dr masturbated in bathroom, dropped my clean-up towel moments before finishing, finished in the tub instead, forget to clean it up and helplessly watched my cat prance through my jizz.	😔
asking my boyfriend to open a container. this happened an hour ago and he's still making fun of me. so i make my own skin care products and i was running low on my body scrub. i pull out all my ingredients and get to work. i make my scrub with leftover coffee grounds, but those can be pretty rough, so i decided that i would let the blender run longer than usual to try and get the grounds as fine as possible. now the kind of blender i use for this stuff is a nutribullet. for those that don't know, you put everything in a clear container and then screw the blades to the top, flip it upside down and attach it to the base, which triggers the blades to start spinning. so it's a-spinning away and i finally decide that it's time to take it off. i'm using coconut oil, which has gotten all over my hands, so i grab the container with a towel to reduce slippage. i grab the top with one end of the towel and the bottom with the other, and it's not budging. i figure it's my weak little girl arms, so i take the container to my bf who is sitting on the couch in the living room. he makes fun of me for a second and then twists the cap off in one quick movement. suddenly, there's this loud pop, and he is so startled that he spills the concoction all over his leg, the couch and...the brand new blue and white area rug we just got. this scrub has coffee, cacao and oil in it. apparently it's scalding hot and he immediately jumps up and flails about working to get his belt and pants undone and shoes kicked off simultaneously so as to remove the hot oil soaked fabric from his lower appendages. the mixture had heated up and expanded in the container, and neither of us noticed because we were holding it with a thick towel. so now i'm trying my hardest to get the extremely noticeable stain out of our new rug while my other half keeps asking me why i tried to kill him. tldr: oil based coffee scrub got too hot and made a loud popping noise that caused my bf to spill it everywhere, burning him and ruining a new rug in the process.	😩
anyone else hear gunshots out ya house and sit there like like this aint even the first time its happened where i am sounds almost like tires popping or a balloon or sumn i love america	😐

appreciate post i'd just like to tell the world how thankful i am for my fiance. i'm not one to share my mushy feelings in person past the basic "i appreciate and love you very much" but they have reddit, so hopefully they see this. ever since i was little, my family would poke fun at anything anyone did. it wasn't meant to be hurtful or anything like that, but some things they said still cut a little deep. because of this, i'm always afraid to do "weird" things in front of anyone, especially including my fiance. today i just happen to be feeling like a pile poo. my stomach was upset and i had a migraine, i just all around felt like trash. whenever i don't feel good, i always like to take showers. they make me feel cleaner and help me to relax. but the problem with showers when i'm sick is i overhear extremely easy and standing just makes my stomach more upset. to combat this, the "weird" thing i like to do is take a chair in the shower and just sit under the water so i don't have to stand. i wanted to do this so bad, but i was deathly afraid my fiance would make fun of me. i casually mentioned i wish i could just sit down in the shower with a chair and relax. this man went out of his way to get me a chair, put it in the perfect spot in the shower, get the temperature just right, turn the fan on so i wouldn't over heat, left the door open, and even got an outfit together so i didn't have to be on my feet too much. i've never felt more accepted or loved in my entire life. he didn't make fun of me or crack a joke, he just did everything in his power to try and make me comfortable since he can't magically make me feel better. i feel like i'm on cloud nine right now and that i'm the luckiest woman in the world	❤️

left my groceries in the car does anyone else ever do this? yesterday i went to the grocery store. i didn't even get that many things. something for dinner and breakfast stuff for the next few days. this morning i went to use my brand new huge thing of coffee creamer and it wasn't in the fridge. i knew i probably had a dum dum moment and left it in the car. sure enough it was in there along with a huge tub of greek yogurt i bought. i do this all the time. one time i left a few naked juices in the car and those things aren't cheap either. at least it was only two things and i can go get more but i get so mad at myself when i do this.	😭

trying to get warm technically yesterday but whatever. so my boss likes to keep the office at fucking sub zero temperatures, it's september and i legit couldn't feel my fingers so i pulled out the trusty heater early this year. this heater was made in the 70's and doesn't have any sort of timer or auto shut off mode, and my dumbass more than likely forgot to turn it off last night before i left. so i got a call this morning about an hour ago from my boss saying that the sprinklers went off overnight and everything in my office and his office, and a handful of other people's is soaked/ruined. i'm on my way to work now, wondering if they know this is 99.999% chance my fault	😳
fun fact majority of my karma on this account came from a tumblr post which i put on r/technicallythetruth which i stole from my crush's instagram spam account before she eventually kicked me out still hurts	😎
