i went to work today afraid i work at a jewish school and today was the first time in my white privileged life that i have ever been in fear of, well, anything happening to me personally and directly. the violence and hate around the world is absolutely horrifying. i just hope these kids make it- between terrorism, climate change, end stage capitalism. today was the first day i have ever been afraid, and i hope the children i am teaching never have to feel this feeling. seriously- may god/mother earth bless us all can we love each other? can we make this world worth of our kids? i fucking hope so.	3
i do this whenever i an happy to increase my happiness. so whenever i am happy i go on to reddit and go through people's posts and find people who are going through tough times and personally message them saying that things will get better and some other motivational stuff and support. i don't know why i like doing that but whenever i am happy i feel like doing it. maybe because of the depression that i went through and the pain that i felt at that time i feel people around us needs support, if not from their loved ones but from strangers like us on the internet. by no means i mean that my messages will solve their problems and turn their lives upside down but that's what i can do. i am not capable of helping people financially or through any other means but this is what i can do. i mean even if my messages are able to cheer up at least one person then ...... common what more can i ask for ..... the happiness of cheering up someone who is going through tough phases of life and supporting them gives me some different level of happiness that i cannot explain through a text. keep smiling and embrace everything that comes in your way . wanna share something? my inbox is always open & i am a good listener.	19
feeling paralysed by fear of failure. can't seem to do work or be productive. i'm not sure what's wrong with me. i'm constantly exhausted and stressed. i'm not sure what's wrong with me. i can't seem to make any progress but i'm constantly working or procrastinating from work. i've always been a go getter type of person; think of shia lebeouf's "just do it". but for the last couple of months, i feel like i've lost all motivation and just want to run away from my phd. i just feel so lost. i was looking for a challenge and now i want to run away from my life. currently looking to take up a hobby outside of my field. i think it would be a nice escape. if you know of any carpentry clubs in london, please let me know	4
i'm crazy in love with my so. it seems like a lot of the internet is devoted to complaining about sos. not too long ago i googled "i love my husband" hoping to see nice stories, and instead found a bunch of lengthy blog posts starting with "i love my husband but..." so i just want to say, without any buts, i love my husband! he is genuinely the most kind and compassionate person i know. he makes me laugh every single day and always goes out of his way to try and make me happy. he's one of the only people it's not exhausting to be around, and he's one of the very few people who gets my sense of humor. i'd love to hear about your sos and what makes them so great	8
i just asked a girl i like out onto my first date ever! just about 5 mins ago, my friend was organizing a group date and asked me to join, i have struggled with really (really) bad anxiety in the past but it happened so fast i didn't even have time to get scared. i was terrified of rejection but she said yes!!! early edit: later virgins	0

eating shitty park food and paying for it so tifu when my family decides to go to busch gardens for the day, and i was pretty excited and i wasn't thinking straight so i didn't eat. so an hour or so later i'm starving and i get the fake cheese fries and proceed to contently eat them. so an hour passes and my stomach starts to feel horrible(like i'm gonna shit my pants) but it goes away and i'm all good, so i get on a ride with a long wait and when we finally board i'm sweating and feeling like crap but i decide against my better judgment to ride anyway, and this is where i fu, the ride starts going up the hill, and it finally goes down, i proceed to shit my self and i guess the smell made me puke, but the ride is going fast so it rains down all over the people behind me and it just turns into a puke fest! the ride stops and the attendant looks at me like he wants to kill me... 10 mins later i get thrown out and ruins the whole day please excuse the format i'm on mobile and its my first post so please don't hate...	14
found [28m] my fiance[27f] posts in a woman's forum, i found out she much preferred sex with her friends with benefits and comments on pictures of naked guys been with my fiance for 2 years i proposed to her on thanksgiving. we aren't living together but plan to after getting married. now before people get mad at me for snooping, my girlfriend has read all of my reddit account posts and even my fb messenger history. so yes, i have seen my girlfriend use this website time to time. when i got home i checked to see if she used her same username for the site and i saw her posts. i was skimming over it and i saw she commented on pictures of naked guys and most of the time they didn't even have their faces on em. one thing though is that it wasn't guys posting photos just women sharing them. now i'll be honest this made me really uncomfortable because reading those comments one she kept talking about how she wanted to suck these guys and give bjs. in our relationship she rarely gives me a bj. and in general she was a lot more sexual in these comments than she ever is with me. i just never seen that side of her, when she does get sexual it's more like a thanks to me. two all of these guys were a lot bigger than me. i am closer to average. after i saw that i already felt pretty bad but now i kept reading. and then i find three huge posts and time to time comments referencing her ex and me. there is one asking on how to find a girl for a threesome and if the girl should be prettier than her or less attractive. she doesn't say it's the ex but based on the time line i am pretty sure it is. also she has never at all expressed interest in doing a threesome with me with another girl there is one about how to get a guy that is terrified of emotional commitment to settle down. she says that he is super attractive and can have any girl he wants. read the post and she basically talks about how despite all the stuff she has done for him he still isn't ready to settle down. then a later post saying he was full of shit that he was just using her but she still loved him. and then there was one with me written 280 days ago saying that she feels blessed that she found me in life. she says that i keep her at an emotionally stable place. she says that her ex wouldn't have made a good boyfriend because he is too much of a womanizer and that dating men that have that many women chasing them is only fun for short term relationships. but she says that she really misses the sex. she says in comments that i make her orgasm some of the times but it's not the same. i don't know what the hell to do. i have dedicated my life to this girl. i spent about a 1k just for valentine's day. only to find that she is only luke warm into me. i can't imagine these thoughts and these feelings ever leaving my head. yet at the same time i have planned out my life with her. also things that didn't bother me in particular now really strings. for example i used to think oh my girlfriend doesn't like giving blow jobs now i realize she doesn't like giving me blow jobs. i don't know guys i'm fucking destroyed. she has said this in the past and her posts show it too that of the guys she has been with i treat her the best, yet she cares about me the least. i don't know. i feel hurt and broken. i understand lots of people are gonna say but she is with you now! and that's all that matters. but i feel like the community college she is going to after being rejected by all of the schools she wanted to go to. i don't know if i'm making too much of it. if i should ignore those words because they are a private forum and i don't know the emotional state she was in. i want to hear what she has to say but i have no idea if she can say anything that will ever make this whole situation okay. **tl;dr- i found out from my fiance's posts on a forum that she much preferred sex with her friends with benefits. i also found out she comments on pictures of naked guys. i am thinking of breaking up.**	12
quit torturing me. my roommate is off work for 5 days while i'm at work doing doubles to make a little extra for a vacation in august, but that's not the worst part about all of this. being here for 16 hours? hardly. being exhausted? nope. dealing with incompetent leadership? close, but not that either. the worst apart about all of this is that while my roommate is comfortably enjoying his week off at home, he constantly sends me photos of my cat. whether it's her snoozing or roaming around or just simply existing like all cats do, he sends a photo with some nonsensical question such as "she's so cute huh?" of course she is. she's fucking adorable. quit torturing me with reminders of how much i want to be home. i hope everyone had an amazing week otherwise. anybody planning a summer vacation? i'm drinking after work tonight so here's to all the hard workers and hardy working.	4
is there hope for short guys in this generation so, i'm a shorter guy (4'11) at 16 years old. and the way girls tray me and talk down to me, i really want to know if there's any hope out there for someone like me. and one other question, why do girls care about hight so much.	1
i [20m] got high for the first time in a while and got in the wrong car when ordering an uber. i gave him my address, too. i got out without being kidnapped and walked to the train instead. then, i called 911 because i thought i was being followed. for some reason, i got a refund for the base fare of $8. now, i'm on my way home on the train. phew i'm still high. p.s. marijuana is not a suitable drug for everyone. i only support marijuana use for medical purposes. goodnight! (i know i sound stupid, this is what weed has the ability to do to a person. i certainly think we need to do more researching before jumping to conclusions & legalizing it. let's focus our attention on psilocybin instead.) oooooooooooooooopooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo tl;dr	9

is it okay to bug my gf for attention because i am lacking attention rn	4
does he like me?? so this guy (20,m) and i (20, f) have been friends and in study groups together for about a year now and we've recently started snap chatting/texting about stuff that isn't school related and we've been getting closer. our friend recently had her 21st and him and i carpooled together since we both had to leave before the bars became 21+ only. anyway afterward he asked if i wanted to hang out at his place, we went over and laid in his bed and watched netflix, and he would inch closer but would all the sudden pull away from me. then his roomates came home from the bars half way through the movie and we hung out with them. he opened up to me about a (personal) secret that night when we were alone but as soon as his friends came he hung out with them i was still engaged in the conversation but it was different. he text me "i don't know what happened" and i shrugged and said it was okay. a couple hours later he walked me out and he walked all the way to my car and then before i could turn around to say bye he was walking saying he'd see me later. when i got home i text him "if you ever want someone to hang with i had fun not watching netflix alone " and he responded "yea i'm real sorry. i kinda fucked up all across the board tonight. next time i'll have to try a bit harder" what does that mean and does it sound like he likes me or am i dumb? lol no idea what i should do	1
i wish i had a girl that cared about me in my life :( a girl that hugs me when i'm sad, tells me that i mean a lot to her, and cuddles with me at night ;( i hope i find you someday	13

is this message to ex a good one or not? okay to start i'm [17m] only sending this if she [18f] texts me first, other than that it is just a way for me to vent. "she" is her friend that manipulates her and hates me for some reason. she left me a voicemail after i told ex we could not be friends and that she was a bad friend to my ex. the voicemail was really rude so i said something out of line about how she threatens to kill her self for attention. i know it was wrong to bring it up even if i think it is true. i apologized but got a "fuck you" in return. at exs birthday party before this somone told me she said "i hate that kid" and it was for no reason i did not even speak to her. and i did not retaliate evan is her current boyfriend/talker, who lives a state away that dated her for a year and a half about 4 years ago. i guess she needed a male to talk to after breaking up with me and he was the closest and they got closer idk. but she thinks he likes her more than he actually does, she has romanticized their past. she went to his prom with him recently she told me she has never disregarded my feelings but dumped me 3 weeks before prom when she asked me to go to prom in october to try to get her back i wrote her a letter and gave it to her at her birthday party (not on her birthday) and i told her how much she meant to me (at the time) and she never responded to it at all i overheard her calling me a narcissist basically because to make her friend group mad, i say some pretty admittedly pompous stuff like bragging about grades and what not. (not unwarranted her friend group tries to annoy ours too) i got my car taken by my mom and she would not give me a ride home (while we were dating) because i "needed to respect my moms punishment" and i forgot to mention that bit about her not doing the same for her mom when i was in the moment **message** fuck you for making me feel like i did something wrong. this whole time i was thinking i was wrong or i wasn't good enough but now i know it was all you. i'm not saying i'm perfect, but i tried my best to keep our relationship healthy (apologizing, wanting to play tennis so we could have alone time and talk, etc...) and i respected your choices and decisions about yourself and did not mock them like other people in your past have (if you catch my drift) because that's not what i wanted from you. and you chose to keep being irritated, you chose to end our relationship because you are immature and mad. you can justify why you did it in retrospect however you want but you know as well as i do it's not true. i did not change, you did. i cannot help that you are so fickle and wishy washy on your opinion of people (from liking to hating or vice versa in a day), saying god put me in your life because you needed me one week and the next saying you don't enjoy my company and you are my punching bag. i keep my word, and i definitely don't lie to people. but i'm glad you did end it because now i can see how toxic you are. you had me walking on eggshells because you are so sensitive that i knew next time you were mad you would breakup with me again, like a third grader. like i said, it's like changing shampoo to you. you expect people to treat you like a princess while you walk all over them. you are also a major hypocrite, fake, a liar, easily controlled/manipulated and very selfish. and you should work on those traits, but i know you will never change because you can't ever see when you are wrong. you are always the victim. with your "i've never disregarded your feelings" ass. everything i wrote to you for your birthday is true (doubt you read it). it is true for the girl i thought you were, but you have either changed or were never her in the first place. and sure what i said to her was immature. but i never said anything to her when she convinced you to break up with me in january or when she talked shit about me when we were dating, or even talking shit about me at your birthday party for no reason at all. and i always had a positive opinion of her until you told me she did not like me. i want to get along with everyone but some people don't want to. p.s. evan used to say you were annoying and he hated you and he only kept dating you because your mom drove him to school lmao also i say/said narcissistic stuff to piss people off, not because i think that way. i am well aware of my faults, more than you know. i have even told you some of the things i'm insecure about. but you are just trying to find stuff wrong with me to talk shit about me with your mom like you do literally everyone else. also narcissists don't apologize, but think what you want. when push comes to shove i always try to fix my mistakes remember when you were telling me that, unlike me, you take your moms punishment because you respect her, no matter what it is. well i remembered how when she took your phone because we went to dairy queen, you took it off of the counter. just wanted to remind you of that since you thought you were right **question** so basically i want to make sure this message is as effective as possible at delivering my point. if anything does not make sense or doesn't help my cause let me know please. tldr: need advice on if message is good or not	6
i wonder if my peeps really understand what would actually happen to me if something happened to my cat. like i don't know if anyone truly understands the connection i have with her. i think without her i would lose all emotional stability. i don't even want to imagine what that would be like. the love and loyalty she shows me outweighs that of which i've felt in some of my friendships lol. she is by my side for everything. does anyone else feel this way about their baby?	4
anybody interested in reading george rr martin's, a song of ice and fire series with me? hello, i have been wanting to read geroge rr martin's a song of ice and fire for the longest time ever. its a rather huge series and it would help a lot if someone were there to read it along with me as a read along. i'm a huge fan of the show and am looking to finish reading the series before the release of the next book, which hopefully martin will someday release. as for the read along we could a certain number of pages every week and continue reading on. if you are interested please dm me or reply to this here thank you.	6

trusting a gas station grocery bag... fuck! stopped at a gas station on the way home from a long day bc out of milk (and don't really have anything else to drink either except alcohol). decided to also buy a cold bottle of wine and chips and salsa bc i have velveeta in the fridge. got home, husb carried in milk. i had everything else in another bag, but the shitty gas station bag was insufficient. salsa fell thru bag, i tried rearranging to save the wine. not quick enough. wine fell. salsa and wine shattered on sidewalk in front of house.	15
i got called a great person today and it was nice. i don't get many compliments that aren't things i've heard dozens of times before, so it caught me off guard in a good wat. it was from a girl i've been talking to since last september. we've been talking a lot lately. i've confided in her more than anyone else i know, and she's told me more than anyone else has. i like it. she's had some pretty bad people in her life in that regard, so it's nothing romantic. but i'm okay with that, i value her friendship. it's nice to have someone to talk to about stuff, deep and normal, in real life, ya know?	6
signing my time card without double checking my hours.. tl;dr at the bottom. so i work full time at a daycare and we get paid biweekly. generally speaking i work between 80-85 hours consistently, sometimes more, especially when we're low staffed. anyway, last week i had noticed that when i clocked out one day that the hours didn't match what i knew i had worked, but i forgot to bring it up with my boss when i noticed it. so while i was signing my time card today it said that i had worked 85 hours for the pay period, i didn't even think twice and signed it... only to realize that even if i had gotten off at the regular end of my shift every other day but one i would still have a minimum of 87 hours.. because i worked a 12 hour shift one day and had an hour long training after work on another... but i know for a fact i didn't get off on time except for 3 out of the 10 days and that my general ot for those days was at least an hour... it doesn't seem like a big deal, but the take home pay for 85 hours is $900~ vs 86 hours is $1000~.. i could have paid my rent with one paycheck and had extra money to save but i fucked up. i feel so stupid for not checking before i signed it tl;dr: i fucked myself out of money that i worked for because i didn't double check my punches despite knowing that the clock in system was being screwy.	4

i just realized something... i am an american living during a time where the nation is divided substantially. who knows if it is at its peak or not, i want to say yes, but people are beginning to call each other terrorists now, so who knows if it will escalate further, but anyhow, i'm alive during it. in the future, in some classrooms, kids are going to get an assignment to interview someone who was alive while all this was happening, and i'm going to be able to answer to them. and who knows, maybe something will happen that overshadows this completely, and i will get to say i was alive to witness it. hopefully people will stay unbiased as to not curve the thoughts of the generation. in my opinion, it will be very important to not put past ideas in the minds of the youth, to allow new ideas to flourish and let this next generation learn from our mistakes and choices as human beings and learn about the history of the nation. also, sorry about the formatting. mobile	7
i did great on my math placement test! just want to celebrate and brag. i haven't taken a math class in 16 years and i failed the last one. i am going back to school for computer science and i needed to place into calculus or pre-cal. i started studying algebra with khan academy a couple months ago, and professor leonard on youtube. well, i forgot most of what i learned about quadratic equations but i passed all of it!! there are 9 sections and i passed every single one! i went from failing algebra ii in 2002, to pre-cal on a college level! i'm just super proud of myself. the hours of work paid off!	6

riding my bike into my friends it was a beautiful afternoon, i was at my mate's house afterschool with about 5 others, and we were playing football (soccer for the american folk) out in his frontyard. we finished a while later and, absolutely knackered, lay motionless on the grass. for some reason, i felt this burst of energy that needed to be relieved after a while, so i hopped onto my mate's bicycle and started riding around the street adjacent to his house. i was picking up some pretty decent speed, and decided to bike in the direction of my mates who were now sitting on the steps in front of the house, and brake just before i hit them. pretty routine thing, i've done this before. it was all just some good friendly banter, right? i started biking in their direction, and hit the brakes about 5 meters before so i could stop in time. to my misfortune, the brakes must have taken offense in my treatment of them and decided to just cease to exist. at this moment i knew i was fucked and tried to slow down with my feet, but to no avail. my mates managed to move out of the way last second, and my bike hit the steps just as i was in this awkward diagonal position trying to jump out of the way, which could honestly not have been worse. i fell forward onto the steps, the handle pressing against my abdomen, and heard a fair share of 'what the fuck dude' before it hit me. i felt a searing pain explode all the way up my genitals. it ran up my entire body and all color left my face. i jumped up and sprinted into the house and to the bathroom, for some reason deciding to yell 'i think i cut my fucking cock off', much to the amusement of the others. this was obviously met with laughter that i could hear from the bathroom as i furiously tore my pants off which were drenched in blood. it was all a big fucking mess, blood coming from everywhere, but i had no idea if the johnson was still intact. i started yelling bloody murder, and his father ended up driving me to the hospital. that was the most *bloody awkward and painful car ride of my life, i shit you not.* end of the day, i had cuts and bruises all over my bishop, and my urethra decided to collapse on itself. i'm catheterized for a month or so, meaning i'm basically peeing through a tube up my dickhole. apparently there could be permanent damage, but its too early to tell if my tallywhacker will ever be the same again. oh, and my cunt ex decided to confess how she no longer has feelings for me that same day. and she wouldn't believe me about my injury, thought i just wanted sympathy. only gets better from here, lads :) tldr: broke my weiner edit: jesus christ this blew up. thank you everyone for your kind words should have used a throwaway in hindsight... edit 2: nevermind, i regret nothing. edit 3: my gold cherry has popped. my knob and i thank you, kind stranger. edit 4: three golds? i am not worthy of this luxury ;_; ;_; ;_;	3

having sex with my girlfriend's sister almost getting caught in bed with her! the year was 2012, when i was working as a stock reservation clerk for a big company, and my girlfriend that time is worked as a call center agent with a graveyard shift schedule. my girlfriend has 2 younger sister, the youngest is still studying that time and the other one that followed her is a bank accountant... we've been in a relationship for a couple of years that time so i'm very close to her family, that i can go in her house anytime, i even have a extra key for their house. saturday night before the incident, she called me asking if my sister has a extra blood pressure kit that her mom can borrow, and then i said to her that tomorrow morning i will give it to her before o go to work, expecting that she's sleeping when i arrive i asked her if we could have a sexy time " " before i go to work, and she say yes, if her family is not at home, her family is very religious people so every sunday morning they attend church mass. the next morning i got up earlier than my usual, so that i can go to her house and give the bp kit, before i leave the hoise i texted her that i'm on my way, and she replied that she's on her way home from work, and she say that she may be asleep when i arrived and i just wake her up. and then a text from her says that she's alone and her parents and sisters are probably on their way to church, *yey* when i was in their front door, i didn't knock and use my extra key, and go directly in her room, my gf and her 2 sisters shared one room, and i go directly to her bed and saw her lying facing the wall with blanket all over her, i scoot behind her then starting to touch her body, and i grab her hand and put it inside my pants, and by the way, when my gf is still tired from work and one of us still want to have sex, she always say "just put it in".. and i'm thinking that at that moment, because anytime her family might show up, lights off, the room is dark.. while we're doing it spoon position,i heard someone opening the front door... i got up fast as i could fixed my shirt, then run outside the room, weeew... then i saw my girlfriend entering the house with a bag of groceries, and then my mind goes... wtf!!!! she told me that she when she arrived from work, she fallen asleep instantly but got up early so that she can make me some food that i can bring for work, that's why she went outside to buy something, and then her sister *the one i f***** a second ago, got outside her room like there's nothing happened, my gf was surprised that she's home, and her sister told her that she came from a trip and fell asleep instant when she got home... me and my girlfriend broke up now since 2015, but still friends and i still have a communication with her sister, but she still acts like there's nothing happened... believe it or not, it really happened to me...	1

not cleaning up after myself this just happened a few minutes ago. i had manly urges while getting ready in the bathroom. i was going to finish in a hand towel but dropped it right as it was about to happen and, knowing that i wouldn't be able to grab it in time, lunged for the bathtub and did it there instead. a few minutes later i remembered that i hadn't run the shower to rinse it down the drain so i returned to the bathroom to do that. thinking i was going to run the faucet for her to have a drink, my cat hopped into the tub. i'm pretty sure my splooge is now on one or more of her paws.	2

how to solve conflicts w an alcoholic roommate (f/21) hi everyone! so i live in a house w 3 other college women and we get along pretty well. it's not perfect, of course we've had issues, but they're pretty minor in the bad roomie world. it's me (f/20), & s, t, and n (all f/21). t and n are very respectful roommates. s on the other hand..... is working her way to full blown alcoholism. she may even already be there - idk the standards for that. she drinks almost nightly, and it's usually the same hard liquor. when she doesn't have alcohol, she is very angry and will sometimes lash out at us (although not rlly a problem to get alc now that she's 21). honestly, i don't know too many details of her childhood and stuff, but it was definitely not beneficial. she clearly has a lot of anxieties, insecurities, and self-loathing, which we can see when she makes "jokes" about herself. im no saint either, but combined w the alcohol it produces unfortunate circumstances. like i said she drinks almost nightly. she has the schedule you'd assume she has - stay up way too late and sleep in til 3pm the next day. lucky for us, her fav drunk activity to blow off her steam is to scream her favorite songs and dance around. her dad made her listen to oldies and she's one of those ppl who loves the beatles and that era of music. her voice is also one of those prominent voices that carries and is overall way too loud. so she often (probably more than weekly, but it tends to be sporadic) wakes us, but me especially bc i'm the one w an early job (and no bfs apt to escape to ). and it's not just like oh she wakes me up, i tell her to be quiet, and we all live in peace. it used to be like that when she first moved in. now her drunk self dgaf. now she's kinda mean in return, and u may have to ask a few times. last night i was kept up from about 1:30-3:30. so not only does that happen, but then there's the mess we wake up to. just the other day, i cleaned the entire house for us bc our landlord was coming (and always yelling ab the mess we have -- usually from her) and she had had friends over so the house was a disaster. she was at work and "forgot" to clean before she left. so i bust my saturday, one of my few day off, cleaning this mess she made and then some. whatever, bc i like a clean house and it's nbd. she gets home and is v thankful, says she'll make it up to me. i guess her way of doing that was having more ppl over the next night and ruining the cleaning i had done. like literally within 8 hours our house went from perfect to mess, after i did cleaned it! im in bed rn and am anxiously awaiting what i'll walk downstairs from her binder last night. im extra pissy w her bc she made this comment last night when i was asking her to quiet down at 3:30 am: "sleeping pills m. sorry you signed a lease with an alcoholic" so the burning question: how do you resolve conflict w an alcoholic? is it even possible? should i only expect this to get worse in the next year we have on our lease? obviously i can talk to her about it sober, but that does no good once she alc hits her. i get along w her pretty good sober, but drunk she's psycho. what can we do as roommates? [tl;dr] alcoholic roommate wakes us up often w her drunk loudness and leaves huge messes and doesn't take responsibility. how do i handle it?	4
what was your favorite part about childhood? i often reflect on my life during the spooky hours to the moments of appreciation during adolescence. little things that made bring a kid so bliss and innocuous; times where my mom wouldn't let me play outside untill i cleaned my room, going to just stuff it all under my bed or in my closet to hurry and play with my friends. the bittersweet feelings of that last half day before summer break, where i had already set plans to do nothing but play pokemon lol. then growing up a little more and sneaking out for a first kiss and being caught for curfew on my walk home. it was all just so fun and new. but as the years go by, the world just seems to get less gentle. i've always been very positive and high energy but in the face of social media, disease, and failure; dispite all of my blessings, it almost seems like a conscious effort to keep positive. anyway, i digress. i spend a lot of time with my baby nephews because i get so excited for everything they have to experience. it's so fun to reflect in their curiosity and amazement. we used to be so dumb	6

what kind of meals should i eat if i want to maintain my weight but be healthier? i've always eaten a bit unhealthily but i'm naturally thin so never bothered to change my diet. i'm getting into my 20s now and want to start watching what i'm eating to look and feel better about myself. so i want to keep my weight the same (50 kg) but need some ideas of healthy but somewhat tasty meals that i can cook. most of the things online are focussed on losing weight which is not my goal. appreciate any suggestions guys!	8
does anyone else get like super in their feelings when they watch a movie, no matter how bad it is (rant/discussion)? so today me, my mom, and my grandparents went to see a movie called booksmart (i don't recommend it). and it wasn't a sad movie or one with a real message, but whenever i watch movies i always get super in my feelings and start thinking. so i guess i just wanted to share some of my thoughts. it may be difficult for everyone now, no matter what's happening, but there's always light at the end of the tunnel. we all want to find love, be successful, do all these things, and sometimes it takes time. but we all go through hardships, and sometimes we feel hopeless or there is no future for us. but we all will pull through, we all have the will, the fight, the emotion to get through anything. i hope you guys can all have a lot of happy times and take those problems you face in life head on, and we always have people in our corner to turn to, whether it's family, friends, or the reddit community. i know you guys have helped me through a lot, and i appreciate you all for that <3 anyway, i just wanted to get that out, just because! you all are loved and important. hope everyone has a great day	3

i had given up i love you. i appreciate you so much and all that you do for me. you make me so happy. i'm sorry i can be so moody all the time. i really do try to be better about it. you are so patient and kind to me even when i don't deserve it. struggling with mental illness i always had this thought that i never deserved to get better and that i just never would. i just accepted that happiness and love wasn't for me. you have changed my world in the most wonderful way. for the first time in my life i want to to get better and i feel like it's a actually an option for me. i want to be better for you, i want to be the best person i can for you, for me too. you deserve so much. i just am so thankful for you and i really can't say it enough. as we approach 1 year together i can easily say it's been the happiest year of my life. i will continue to work on myself and keep trying to get better. i love you so much thank you for loving me too	3

how we need to change hey guys your friendly neighborhood teenager here, so climate change is a thing. alot of people don't know where to start to help this massive issue. so here's some small things you can do to improve your carbone footprint. - go to bed early so you turn off your lights earlier and you get more sleep! -be more aware of how many lights/fans/anything else you are using. if you leave a room just turn off everything, easy. - spread the word. i know you may think it looks like your being a dickhead if you say to one of you friends "turn off the lights when you leave the room mate" but really it might just change they think unfortunately climate change is our issue to solve. just think how much energy you save if you don't stay up with the lights on until 12 every night. combine that if a large amount of people that read this post doing the same thing as you. i know this problem seems impossible to solve, but it's not choice of if we're going to solve this problem, it's when we are. most grown ups who are meant to be a role model aren't doing fuck all to solve climate change, so let's start now, so that when we grown up and leave this subreddit, we'll have less to clean up on our world. sorry if there any spelling errors thanks	1

how to get stuff back after a breakup? my ex broke up with me over the phone a little over a week ago. we agreed not to talk for a month. problem is, we never decided on what would happen with my stuff. he's a three hour drive away from me so it isn't convenient to just "come over and get it". what do you guys suggest? it's a decent amount of things, it'd be expensive to ship. should i wait until the end of the month no contact agreement to contact him, and then how do i arrange to get them back? and let's be clear: i don't feel like driving three hours to see the dude after he dumped me.	1

putting a bandaid on my face ltl ftp etc. this situation started last saturday and is ongoing so i'm a person who gets acne regularly and one way i've found to help heal my popped zits is to put neosporin on a bandaid and wear it over the zit while i sleep. i've done this many times over the years with no issue. i also don't have very sensitive skin usually so i had no reason to think this would cause any problems. well monday i get up for work and take the bandaid off. i was greeted by a ring of itchy red bumps around my (actually fairly well healed) zit. i thought, oh well. dermatitis, it happens etc. put some ointment on it and move on. [9/19](<url>) the next day it's starting to scab a bit, which i guess is normal considering it had been quite flaky and itchy (no i did not itch it). it didn't look great though and it's right on my cheekbone. i work in a salad shop where we work directly with customers as we make their food so having a giant wound on my face is not ideal. i found a hydrocolloid bandage and slapped that on for work on tuesday. it hid the rash nicely and i figured it would create a nice moist, clean space for it to heal. i was wrong [9/19](<url>) i took the hydrocolloid bandage off when i got home and it didn't look too much different. the only thing is my throat gland on the side of the rash was swollen and sore, and that side of my neck was in pain. i managed to prop my head up to sleep that night and started a round of antibiotics i had been hoarding for a reason just like this let me just say i know it's not a good idea to use antibiotics outside of a doctors prescription. i recently lost my health insurance at the same time as moving across country and haven't gotten any yet. being a broke ass young adult i did everything in my power to avoid shouldering an urgent care or er bill. [9/20](<url>) antibiotics start working (i think) and by friday my neck is feeling much better and less swollen. i even think the rash is started to slow down. saturday i was feeling much better other than my face. saturday night i noticed that my rash was still spreading. it was almost twice as big an area than it was originally and spreading in two directions. after a few near panic attacks about my face falling off i managed to get some sleep and decide to bite the bullet and go to the doctor on monday. [9/22](<url>) so today i went to the doctor, and was diagnosed with impetigo. it's a form of a staph infection and it's pretty contagious so obviously i can't work for a few days. (i need that money to pay for this doctor bill/scripts) i was prescribed a new antibiotic and steroid and told to come back if there's no improvement by wednesday. what worries me though is that the doctor was surprised that my first antibiotic didn't stop the spread of the infection on my face so we'll see if these new meds help. [today, monday](<url>) i waiting for the rash to stop spreading to worry about if/how badly this will scar my face	4

thinking my house was getting burgled. it was just last night at 1am so technically today but since it was a weekday and me being the nocturnal youngster i am, everyone was asleep except me. i woke up my dad thinking there were burglars in the house. the kitchen door went back and forth like crazy and there was no one downstairs, i was terrified because i had locked up everything securely half an hour prior to it and couldn't sleep in bed. so after getting him up we make the trek downstairs. we went full on the walking dead style with chisel and hammer in hand, not even joking. using army hand motions picked up from movies indicating the coast was clear we progressed, slowly but surely. inspected every door, every room and every table, heck, every cupboard too, anywhere someone could stay hidden but alas, no burglars found. there were extreme winds and somehow they must be gotten through a gap somewhere which we couldn't spot, it couldn't have been anything else. they got in somehow and messed with the doors and that was it. so we had to block them with chairs. i mean, i thought that burglars could use the winds to camouflage themselves making last night the perfect opportunity. it didn't help that every five minutes the opposite garden's light kept turning on suspiciously. but only now i just found out it was motion sensitive . oh well, it's clear. at least i can sleep in peace now. tl;dr: if you think you're being burgled on a windy day. go to sleep.	9

i'm on the fence about having roommates again. i'm 25 and going to be 26 in july. i'm a guy and have had roommates before. first roommates were two guys in college. they were cool and respected my space and were friendly as well. don't talk anymore and don't know what they do now but don't regret meeting them. second roommates was a childhood friend i grew up and went to school with all the way to high school. other roommate was a guy i met through my childhood friend. he was ok but a little older and had problems with admitting his own flaws sharing a house and was a bit rude when confronted. i do enjoy having roommates and living with people i just meet if we can connect and share the same interests. it's just when i do end up rooming with people(s) it causes me anxiety no matter if they're the most nicest people and they don't do any kind of negative thing to be a bad roommate. i guess i feel like i'll be the bad roommate any small inconvenience i would make. am i over thinking it? also i know some places have a certain compatibility process to make sure the person you get roomed with matches with my interests and living style but i feel like i'm just to weird.	9

i think my friend (17f) likes me (18m) but i don't know for sure. tl;dr: i think my good friend (17f) has a crush on me. i'm nervous to ask her out because if i'm reading this wrong i don't want to ruin the friendship. so i (18m) have this friend of mine (17 f) and she's always texting me about relationships in general, she tells me she has a crush but doesn't wanna say who. for example the other day she was asking me what i would do if a first date went wrong, and other stuff about first dates. also she wanted to take a guy to prom that didn't go to her school, guess what i don't go to her school. we mostly text in a group chat with her, myself, and our other friend john. she also told my little bro that i was flirting with her as a joke one time, idk why. now you may be thinking u/usedtimecapsule, you're an idiot she likes you! well i have my doubts. i've only thought about it recently because my friend john thought she might like me and she "rejected me". she kinda hinted at it but she didn't straight up say she didn't like me. i kinda rejected her back jokingly but the truth is, i'd give it a try because we'd either be really compatible or not at all. i never really thought about it until after we "rejected" each other. i was just like shit what if we dated. btw she asked me about first dates **after** the whole rejection thing. most of the flirting has been after the "rejection". she has told me she never wants to make the first move, and i wouldn't be surprised if she did it to hide her true feelings. it was also in that group chat so she may have not wanted to say anything that wasn't in private with me. i know it's a big reach, but i know her very well. this whole week we've been kinda being flirty with each other, more than friends usually are ya know? i have other female friends and we never talk to each other like that. my other female friends never talk to me about relationship stuff, or anything close to that. that's why i'm so confused, the signs might be there but sometimes i get opposing signs. she either really doesn't like me like that or she does and didn't wanna say anything in a 3 person group chat. i don't know which it is yet. i know the rejection thing makes it sound like she definitely doesn't, but trust me on this, she likes to "joke" a lot and hide her feelings. if i end up trying to ask her out, and fail i don't want to compromise the friendship. however if my speculations are correct i could end up in a really good relationship. i'm thinking about flirting with her a bit (for real) and saying she flirts with me (cause she kinda does) in conversation to tease her a bit, and then see how she responds to my advances. is this a good idea? kinda take it slow and not jump the gun yet? any thoughts about my situation? latest flirt from last night: she asked if "i loved her " and i said definitely. then i sent a post (instagram dm) where it said to say i love you. she didn't wanna say it back for some reason. do i just go for it at this point i think she's just nervous to make a risky move, which is fine because i'll do that part. that's obviously flirting on her end though right?	13

taking the wrong pills ok this happened several months ago but i still kick myself for this a bit. on mobile btw. quick warning its a tad gross. tl;dr at the end so this was on a saturday and unfortunately for me i had started my period and the cramps were awful. and sadly my girlfriend had to hear me complain on and on about as well, we were on the phone, but in my defense it really hurt. so i finally gave up trying to deal with it and went through my drawers to try and find any pain killers i had, i only need to take two and then i'm fine for the rest of the week. i found some and took a couple then did my thing and continued with the call. but something wasn't right, i was still in pain! i kept telling my girlfriend how much it hurt (and joked that i was gonna die, the usual) but i noticed i needed to us the bathroom a lot more then usual but whatever right? wrong. i got up to flush and my piss was orange! my dumb self didn't take pain killers i took some pills for a urine infection (had one back in freshman year and i believed this happened early senior year or during the summer) i felt beyond stupid as i told my girlfriend what happened and obviously she laughed and called me dumb, rightfully so as i kept complaining to her about only to find out i did a stupid. i know make sure i double check what i'm taking which i should have done in the first place tl;dr- i took pain killers that didn't work and complained to my girlfriend about it, only to find out they were pills for a urine infection	11

kissing my child's owie and getting poop in my mouth this actually happened today, just a few hours ago. apologies in advance for typos or formatting, i'm on mobile. first, some short back story. i have a 1 1/2 year old daughter, and (like many parents) my wife and i will kiss her owies when she gets hurt. for some reason, this greatly helps with the healing process. she really latched on to this idea a few months ago and loves it so much that she will pretend she got hurt on her hand so we'll kiss her. it's adorable. she'll come up to me holding out her hand or wrist saying "ow, ow, ow!" so it's become a habit to automatically kiss her hand when she holds it out to me. i'm sure you can see where this is going. this morning started like many others, with me waking up to my daughter calling me from her room for me to get her out of her crib. to set the stage, it was still a bit dark and i didn't have my glasses on, so i wasn't seeing clearly. i had just woken up, so i wasn't thinking clearly. i walked into her room and she was sitting in her crib silently holding out her fingers with a sad look on her face.. (cue dramatic music.) i instinctively reached out and grabbed her hand and placed a gentle kiss on her fingers. i felt something wet on my lips, and i looked closer at her fingers, and to my horror, she had soft brown poop on them. and so now, so did i in my mouth. in retrospect i'm impressed that i didn't scream. i calmly picked her up, cleaned off my lips with a wipe, cleaned off her fingers with a wipe, put hand sanitizer on her hands, my hands, and my lips. i changed her diaper, and put more hand sanitizer on my lips and hands when i was done. yuck. thankfully it only got on the outside of my mouth, but i'm still horrified. my wife is getting home from a weekend trip and is arriving in a few minutes. nobody tell her there was poop on my lips or she won't kiss me anymore tl;dr: my daughter was holding out her fingers as if she wanted me to kiss an owie. i did it, and got poop on my lips.	1
accidentally driving a parade float somewhere i shouldn't have my wife and i pulled a float in my town's christmas parade today. for the most part, things went pretty well. nobody fell off, was run over, and we didn't have any mechanical problems. for a few hours, i held a smile and repeated the same wave over and over to the thousands of people lining the route. i called out "merry christmas!" so many times that it stopped being words and just turned into a memorized sound. to entertain myself, i'd occasionally mix it up. "merry christmas, film in landscape, not portrait!" i might yell with a smile to someone video'ing the parade. "merry christmas, buy a house!" (the float was for the realtor group my wife's is in) to someone else a few blocks later, and a couple times i threw in a "kerry mixmas!" because if anyone noticed, how could they be sure it wasn't just their hearing? as far as parades go, it was pretty smooth. afterwards, though... as these things often do, it ran late and she had an appointment with a client so i volunteered to drive the float back to where it had been constructed. we swapped keys and she texted me the details. "here's the address. when you get there, go left", she summarized afterwards. the way she described it, i had the idea that i'd go straight ahead into a driveway then take the left fork of a y. we parted and i trundled off, taking the cargo truck with float where google maps told me. i saw a driveway where i expected but as i pulled in, i realized i had misunderstood her instructions pretty thoroughly. there was no y, and as i passed the point of no return i saw there was an actual separate driveway a few yards west of the one i'd taken. the place where they'd built and staged the float is, i discovered, also an "event location", the kind that hosts all kinds of parties and stuff like that. had i understood the directions better, i could have snuck around the back through the service road that bypasses the main building, but that's not what happened, i took the main driveway and an 'event' was in progress. also, it wasn't a party or a barn raising or quinceanera, it was a funeral. scene: you are grieving with a couple hundred friends and family. it's a solemn affair (as is the custom when the departed is liked) and as a group, you are all sharing your memories and sense of loss in an orchard. the beauty of the surroundings comes with the quiet you can only find away from the city. uncles, sisters, cousins, friends... this is a chance for everyone to reflect on someone who touched all of your lives and share in the sadness of their passing. around you, nature reminds you that even when there's loss, life continues. the healing process teaches us that death is an integral part of life and we must all face it at some point, and sharing the grief helps us recognize how important it is to appreciate the limited time we have toge- you hear a motor. maybe someone's running late? the engine gets louder and now you hear some branches squeaking past something. somewhere in the back of your mind, you understand that this is not a compact sedan but something larger. it isn't until the front of the large truck noses around the corner that you understand this isn't the late arrival you were expecting. around you, conversations peter out and everyone starts looking in the same direction. formal, dark dresses, black suits, children fidgeting with unfamiliar ties, they're all turning to watch because... suddenly parade float. back in the cab, i realize that i'm committed. there is no place to turn around, i have to go straight ahead. as i get closer, the crowd slowly parts to let me through, and i know that i do not belong where i am. this is not the plan we had worked out earlier, but i get the idea that stopping to revise would be even worse so i need to blaze on through. i'm hunting for something in my tiny social skills toolbox to provide guidance, and i've got nothing. as i pull the cheerfully decorated parade float past the silent crowd of mourners, my brain suddenly grabs onto a new the plan with the desperation of a drowning man reaching for a rescue buoy and the "parade route" program fires up. i'm pulling a float, there's a giant crowd... i feel myself starting to slip into this groove and i fight it. i do manage to stop from parade waving and in a bit of luck, my windows are rolled up so they probably don't hear me yell "merry christmas", but the giant fake parade smile... the more i try to stop it, the wider it gets. fueled by panic, i can't turn it off. the crowd, they don't look angry, they certainly aren't smiling, but they stare back blankly it's like they're trying to process what they're seeing. this cargo truck rumbling past them is covered with sparkling tinsel everywhere is pulling a long trailer behind with huge toy-block style letters spelling out 'realtor'. the float is full of giant toy story characters. the t-rex, buzz lightyear, sheriff woody, slinky dog... they sway slightly against the oversized display presents and candy canes as they pass through the crowd of grieving people but unlike their driver, they aren't making accidental eye contact with almost everyone in the crowd. approximately one eternity later, i drive out of the courtyard and join the service road i was originally supposed to take. i can't bear to look in my mirrors, but i can feel a hundred-plus pairs of eyes watching me. a few moments later, i'm out of sight and start breathing again. ditching the truck and float in the pre-arranged orchard, i head back home in my wife's car. "i drove a parade float through a funeral", i text her.

burned out before i begin, woo this is my first post on reddit but um sry if i im a lil too dramatic cos that's just me let's go back to around may. i just had my mid years. turns out i did pretty well and i was actually 3rd position. but it didn't last for long. with that the first semester ended. not long after did the second semester roll around. i actually became really forgetful and got some scoldings from teachers. i don't know why but i also became really inattentive. i felt like i didn't pick up on some stuff the teacher said. like she would say "do questions 1-10 but use this particular method" and i would pick up on "do questions 1-10" but not on the "particular method". a few weeks in i realised i was doing not as well as i used to do on tests and stuff. and i researched about it and i think i might be burned out. i've also noticed that i'm getting more tired after school and doze off without me wanting to (unpopular opinion but i think naps are a ways of time) fast forward to today. i wanted to be productive but as soon as i sat down at my desk and started to do my homework. but i just couldn't do it like i could just not concentrate. i also just got my common test (it like a series of exams inbetween mid years and finals if that makes sense) results back and they are not up to my expectations whatsoever. im wanting to work hard but my brain doesn't want to (?) please give me some advice on what i can do	1
sad boi hours i'm pretty sad, as i got left on read twice by the girl i like. i messaged her last week and we had a pretty good convo, that wasn't one sided. her responses were higher quality than mine, if anything. she left me on read three days ago. i followed up with "what's good?" two days ago and got left on read. she seems polite and her responses were good so why/ did i get ghosted? i responded pretty fast sometimes but other times i'd wait a few hours. maybe i was too needy? just would like anyone's opinion. thanks	2
i'm too lazy to do work aaaaaaaaa but the teacher wants to check our work tomorrow why on the last day of the year and we are still having our break, come on	4
among us on switch isn't worth it. n it only do you have to have an online membership, but you also have to pay $5 for it. not only that, but they don't even have in game voice chat. you have to use the nintendo switch voice chat. tl;dr, just get it on mobile.	2

me and my best friend have developed the habit of saying "love you bro" at the end of calls we've known each other since fourth grade, around ten years now. one day recently we got drunk and i told him that i felt really lonely, like i had nobody else in the world. my parents are the embodiment of r/raisedbynarcissists, and i don't feel any love for them. he told me that no matter what he would always be there, and we spoke in more detail about it the next day on the phone. he ended that call with a "love you dude" and we've been doing it since then. there's nothing gay about it. just pure wholesomeness. felt like sharing.	6
i just drove for the first time, it was super fun at first i was like spongebob, i pushed the pedal too hard in the beginning but then it was alright, although i felt like the car wasn't going straight but my dad told me it was just an illusion. it was nice, i wanna keep doing it. how was your first time driving?	1

thinking my tinder match was serious. so this happened last night around 11:30. i had read that ask reddit the other day about tinder experience and i decided that i needed my own, so i made an account. i joined mainly to just troll and see the shit show. does that make me a bitch? probably. any ways, we'll call him j. j: 'i see you're a mother of one, want me to make you a mother of two?' i'm thinking what the hell, who says that as a pick up line, must be a troll... this troll can't out troll a troll. so i go along with it and tell him my place asap. he ask for my address and i give him one.... to the local police station. about 30 minutes later he says he's almost there. i give a quick chuckle thinking this kids not serious and is just being an asshole. well i was wrong... j: 'i took an uber and you gave me the address to a police station, seriously?' que panic. this guys pissed and now stranded in front of a police station. fuck. he then asks me to please respond so he can get a ride or have somewhere to go. i'm not a total cold and heartless bitch, so i gave him a ride home... he was mad. really mad. no amount of small talk could soften the blow. not even an offer of mac n cheese bites from sheetz. he called me a fucking bitch and the he's glad he at least got to waste an hour of my time. i fully deserved it. lesson learned; am a total bitch. sorry j edit: removed his name..	5

i just wanted to praise the guy who posted about the transgender woman on the bus, and the mods for handling everything so well! i'm a transgender woman myself and will be coming out to the world as such very soon, and have not been having a great time irl recently, and that post really really made my day. it's any little things like that can make a terrible week or day be just a little bit better! it's not too often you see such a wholesome post and comment section about us, and it definitely made me smile. it's just so good to know that there are people that are so kind and care about us.i really wish those that hate would mind their own business and leave us alone. tl;dr, thank you again op from bus story and mods for handling that so well and i now have a big smile on my face	6

vent and request for advice on life and how to feel more in control i [35m] left my wife[35f] 3 years ago after 7 yrs of marriage, approx 10 yrs together, because she was treating me as a live in worker. there was no more love there, and i had lived that way for 2 years, feeling like a stranger in my own house. we have 2 beautiful children together and still get along quite well but i will never trust her with my heart again. she is a good support for me..... but i have not been able to move on with my life so far. we were trying to sell our assets at first and got half way there- we still have a house together for which i have been responsible for the mortgage for the past 3 years. i've been paying this as my child support. but i would much rather have my children more often and work less (not possible due to the financial demand in maintaining the mortgage). the sticking point is that she is quite ill and requires a new organ to get on with her life (ie not die), and she is refusing to sell the house (i can understand why) until she has had her new organ. there is obviously no set time for this and it's all in the dark type stuff. i'm having a lot of trouble because i dont feel in control of my life. i live with family due to financial stuff (the house i live in is far less than ideal, and while i love my family it is extremely negative for me mentally) and cant seem to be able to step out on my own because of the organ/finance situation. i know i could be a bad guy and force the issue but i dont want my children to think poorly of me, and i also want to do the right thing as much as possible in life in general. i am just getting to the end of my tether because this has affected other people (in that i haven't felt that i could build a relationship with a number of interested amazing people due to the burdens i am carrying) and i just wonder how many times things can blow up in my face and how long i can sacrifice my life, needs and goals for other people. i have taken control of as much as i can in my life (caring for myself, development in career) but these other issues seem to loom a bit too much over me. i feel like i'm turning into a flogged out forever alone kinda guy and don't really know what to do about that. i mean at this stage i'm guessing that the organ is close and my exes health situation worsening is making my mental condition feel worse, as it's like i'm a rat in a cage waiting for freedom and i can taste it ( also care about her wellbeing as she is not only the mother of my children and otherwise would be excessively traumatic for my children, but also she is a good person and mother who deserves to be around for her children and future). if i didnt push new people that cared about me away i'd at least have more support but hey you live with what you got and me doing that is part of my coping mechanisms for this situation i'm guessing (as well as not wanting to burden others). kudos to those that made it to the end. i would buy you a coffee but then youd have to listen to me bitch some more tl;dr i am sooking about my life being a mess due to situations out of my control, and i'm venting, but any advice on how to improve myself and feel more in control of things would be helpful	1

me and my friend just thought of the best invention! so we were driving in my car and he stepped on a water bottle on the floor. i took a sip from the bottle und noticed that there was a small hole in there. but the cool thing was that when you drank from it, the pressure inside the bottle wouldn't decrease, because air is going to get sucked back in through the hole, meaning you can drink a whole bottle without having to let air in again (with plastic bottles) but what would be even cooler is if you would build some kind of valve into glass bottles (which can't make up for the decrease of pressure naturally), which would make it easier to drink out of glas bottles! i had to share this and i didn't know which other sub to post this to	1
doing laundry this happened last night while i was rushing to do laundry before going to bed. i recently received my iphone 7 plus after exchanging my note 7 which was the absolute greatest phone except the very small percentage that blew up. anyways i was playing with it while putting all my laundry into the washer. now a couple of pieces of clothing dropped on the floor while stuffing the washer and i picked it up with the hand holding the phone. then i closed the door to the washer and set the machine and it locked the door. now as i was going back to the elevator i couldn't find the phone i was holding...then it hit me, i put it into the washer with the article of fallen clothing! i start to panic and try to pry the door open to the washer but it's already locked. then i remembered that the phone is water resistant and i pray to god that i will be good forever if my phone survives the soapy waters for 30 minutes. when the washer was finished out came cleaner clothes and a broken iphone tl;dr tried to be productive and do my laundry, broke my new phone instead	12

i think science is another extension of my religion. i'm fascinated by the wonders of the universe and how by some sick fluke we are all here to be. i grew up thinking everyone is made from god's image. i look to the stars and see just that. the infinite physics behind it and the glorious life that is produced by our cosmos. i can't nail the quote in the bible but i remember there was a saying that "he has provided us with everything we needed." medicine we've derived from our natural habitats have proven just that. the more we look, the more we find. i'm kind of ashamed we don't explore the ocean more. didn't we (now don't hang me if im wrong) emerge from that abyss? imagine if the cure for cancer is down there or we develop and adapt to life below the blue, saving ourselves from ourselves. it's crazy but i really do thank all you nerds for giving me an image to all of his creations (even if you don't believe ) .	8

etika has been found by nypd, he is deceased. i want to make this post to let you know that there is hope, if you are struggling with depression reach out. etika tried, in very subliminal ways, his tweet asking when his last mental breakdown should be, normal people would help him, but if you read through the comments, itms a bunch of kids joking around with him, "june 20th" "june 19th" "june 21st" he jumped on june 20th, meaning he read the comments. please, if you are struggling, don't end your life, there's so much to do, people love you, even though it may not seem like it, like there's no hope. there is. i'm leaving this post off saying that i love all of you. if you are struggling please text 741741, a crisis line, or call the national suicide hotline.	3

i'm turning 19 next month and i have two sons...and to be honest with you, i couldn't be loving my life anymore. looking at old pictures from when my first kid was born, so of course in getting sentimental. i'm 18 currently. my oldest son was born when i was 17...i was afraid of him for three weeks, because i had no idea how to raise him. i mean, i knew how to care for him and see to his needs, but absolutely no idea how to raise him and teach him what he needed to know in life. one day, his mom goes to work and he and i are home alone. watching hockey. go red wings! i'm lying on the couch with this kid lying on me, stomach to stomach, and he passes out. i realized it after a while, and it suddenly struck me that i was a father and i honestly felt overwhelmed. he was cuddled up on me, and i was honestly just thinking "oh my god i love him so much" that was the first real time i ever felt id bonded with my son, and it was amazing...ever since that day, i've been busting my ass to turn myself into the man my sons will see and want to be. they're amazing. couldn't love my girlfriend or our kids any more than i do. my oldest is a complete ass sometimes, but he's only 1 1/2, so i can't hold it against him. proposing to my girlfriend next friday. ever since that day i knew i wanted to spend the rest of my life with this girl and our kids. just didn't know when i'd ask.

how everyone's doing? what are your plans for near future? i'm super happy right now; just had a very hot shower, eating mac n' cheese and watching my favourite detective tv series about hercule poirot. i'm also going back home next week and finally going to see my family in almost 2 years (i've been studying in a foreign country this whole time). i hope you're all having a lovely monday and that this week is going to be super productive for all of you	6

chasing my cat barefoot in arizona dear reddit, it is currently 111 degrees out in phoenix arizona where i live. today i heard the ice cream truck passing by and i wanted to get my little sisters ice cream cause i hadn't in a while. however, the truck was passing by quite fast and so i did not feel i had enough time to put on shoes. this was a mistake (and a grave one). after walking to the end of my driveway i realized i'd never make it and i had to run back to the house. the damage had been done though. my foot looks like the skin is falling off. i want to show you guys but i can as i'm on my phone. i'll post a link in the comments later today if anyone wants to see my poor footsie. reddit there is a silver lining. the ice cream truck did stop and my little sister (who had put on shoes) got to get the ice cream. don't be me dudes tl;dr my dudes i have 3rd degree burns on both my feet and i had to go to urgent care because i wanted to get icecream for my sisters but didn't feel i had the time to put on shoes.	18
i (19f) posted a nude artistic picture of myself and now am suffering retaliation from my parents i really need some advice for my relationship with my parents: so, a couple weeks ago, my photographer friend (21 (i guess) f) invited me (19f) to make a photoshoot of myself, in order to help her business grow. she likes taking nude pictures of people, and my parents knew that. they agreed to take me where the photoshoot would be (about 3 hours away) but told me that i should be cautious about what kind of picture she would be taking of me (they meant nudes). i said ok and i went there with my father - at this point i wasn't going to pose naked at all. but when me and my friend were in the woods to shoot, i realized how amazing nude pictures among nature would be. so i asked her to portrait me naked (but not the entire body, just from waist to face). i didn't tell my parents that, but they were suspicious of me and asked if i did it. i said yes, because i don't like lying to them. and of course they got really mad at me and told me not to post it to the internet. guess what? i posted it (nipples censored because society). not because i wanted to fight them or something, but for art and feminism (you can see the point i was trying to make and the picture in this link: <url>). if you guys want, i can translate it to you (it's in portuguese). days went by and only yesterday my mother found out about the post (someone probably told her). again, she and my father got mad at me and asked me to delete it. i said i wouldn't, of course. now, as a retaliation, there no longer is wifi at home 🏻 very mature way to handle family issues. i believe things around here might get emotionally quite tense between us, which makes me really sad. i need to negotiate a solution with them asap but i don't know what to do! well, one more thing: i also am gay, and they don't know about it. you guess why. and this whole situation makes me wonder how little they truly understand me. how is my perspective of my future like? i can only feel hopeless about it. i could never share my life with them as a normal person. right now i feel miserable and alone.	18
what are some foreign albums you have? (thinking along the lines of not from uk, u.s., etc) talk about it. i have this small photograph stuck onto my mirror of a band i like from japan and i realized "hey, wait a minute, i have a few of their albums." and dug through my bookshelf to find these. figured i'll share here and have a chat with you guys about albums from different countries that you have. how did you get into that band/artist? where are they from and what prompted you to buy their album? if you're sharing a pic like i am, it can be a physical copy or digital (like bought off of itunes or something) <url> here's mine! from top to bottom: i got these all i'm the same year. the parenthesis are their release dates inside beast: the gazette (2013) division: the gazette (2012?) traces, best of 2005-2009 (2011) i got into these guys from anime (lol). their song was the opening theme for black butler season 2. one of my favorite things about them is that they seriously do not sound "anime-like" (except for that opening theme. it's not my favorite) like other japanese bands in the v-kei/jpop genre. to be honest, they ruined my chances of liking other v-kei bands. i liked a few here and there, but i find myself coming back to them a lot because i enjoy their sound. i also bought one of their eps (?) called fadeless on itunes, but i no longer use apple and it was downloaded onto my ipod 4th gen	1
this was one of my better birthdays i used to work for my dad. he is an amazing guy, but not really emotional or sentimental. we were in a small construction team, and never did anything to celebrate birthdays. that was fine, i learned to just not care much about my birthday. last night (day before my birthday), i came home (to our new house of less than one week) to my wife standing in the kitchen with a cake that she made and the door decorated with streamers. i cried a little. at work today, my actual birthday, my work friends had decorated my desk. i've only been there about 7 months, but i felt more loved there than i ever did with the guys i worked with for 6 years on my dad's crew. everyone that walked by wished me a happy birthday. i felt really special on my birthday, for the first time in probably 12 years. that's all.	8

idk what to do anymore.. ive been bullied, harassed, and accused for the past two months. im 7 subs from 400 subscribers and all of a sudden me and my channel is being tossed in a storm of harassment and hate. its gotten so bad that i had to delete my discord server and i almost deleted my entire channel 3 times. everyday i get endless harassment and accusations about me tracing and then groups heading to my channel to dislike my videos. people have even stolen my art and defaced it! this has been going on for 2 months now and idk how much longer i can take this. today i posted a video discussing my thanks to 390 subs this year and discussed my mental state with all the allegations against me. i even posted a speedart of my whole work to prove i don't trace. then not even 10 minutes after the group of harassers spammed my video and a few other of mine with dislikes and left. the only thing keeping me from deleting it was one nice comment from a sub saying they believe me and have faith in me. the reason i am posting this here is because a lot of you may understand and know the kind of stress i am dealing with right now. my back is up against the wall and this is the only place ik that is safe anymore. ive tried everything from blocking and reporting, but these guys will manipulate other groups into hating me or create other accounts every time.. this link is to some of the harassing and hate they've caused me. if you wish to look go ahead.

almost crashing my car in the snow... whilst dressed as elsa from frozen. it was world book day today at the school i work at. an outfit i had planned weeks ago was elsa from frozen, wig and everything. so i get ready today and look out of my window and it's just snow snow snow. thought we'd seen the last of the snow in england. now if you don't know: england and snow is just chaos. we don't know how to deal with it and don't grit roads well or in time. so i set off... thinking it was fine. i was going on a flat run, hoping no one was looking at me. anyway, i try go up a hill which in sense was a bad idea anyway i accept that. my car full on started to skid and i was trying to avoid going into things. i had to let it roll down the hill and put my hazards on. anyway, a nice man came to help me. tapped on my window. as i rolled down my window you could just see his "wtf" face. i had a lot of explaining to do to the people who were helping me get unstuck. never been more embarrassed in my life. if you want a visual: this is what i looked like before i set off <url> tl;dr - dressed as the queen of snow. snow defeated me. snow 1 - elsa 0	1

i teach japanese to adults and one of my students brought in a box of krispy kreme to share during the break and it was so heartwarming! so i teach a beginner japanese class to adults. the numbers in my current class dropped quite a bit so there's only 2 students in the class at the moment. last night i had a 10min break during my 2hour class and one of my students were like "yes! a break!" and then left the room so i thought he really wanted to go to the bathroom or something. few minutes later he comes back with a box of doughnuts for us 3 to share and the gesture was just so cute and heartwarming that it made me super happy the student isn't particularly good at english so i felt like the doughnuts were his way of communicating that he enjoys the class. what's something that someone did unexpectedly that made you feel all warm inside?	6
i hate new year's eve because i never have a plan most of my friends leave to another city for new year to meet their friends there. my best friend is going to another country for a month, and the only friend who is staying here, already made plans with their friends. i went with him last year but i didnt really have fun at that party. so probably no plans for this year i guess	9
so i just discovered reddit about a month and a half ago my cousin told me it was a great website with great people and discussions and funny / interesting content - he couldn't have been more wrong. i've had only one good thing happen to me. these people behave like children and sheltered girls it's depressing and pathetic. i can't even find the words to describe the people here. i'm guessing they're all overweight and virgins? whatever. i'll never log in or register an account on this website ever again.	1
fwb or more? i (25f) not sure whether to end current 'relationship' with friend (34m) because feelings. first reddit post, long one here. so hopefully i'm doing this right some back story here on myself (25f) just before the following started i moved cities and got a new job. don't have my own place to live yet and not in any position for a relationship. last relationship i had ended extremely poorly about 7 months before and i've been in a really good place emotionally, being by myself with no commitments or being with anyone. i still don't necessarily want something serious yet, at least not in any hurry. want something that just comes natural. met him (34m) at work, in a different department/company in retail in same building so we don't actually work together. when we would be at work he would come over to the kiosk i work at and talk to me pretty much any time i wasn't helping a customer, or smile at me quite frequently across the store. which was often. we started hanging out outside of work around christmas once we realized we had quite a bit in common (being homebodies just chilling at home playing games, watching shows, love of huskies, etc) as just friends, usually once a week. when we hung out it was usually suggested by myself, he wouldn't mention it or say anything. one night when we were hanging out i asked if he liked me he said he thought i was cute but didn't want anything serious (not really a direct answer to my question lol but otherwise i agreed) so this was laid out ahead of time. i mentioned to him that i also didn't want anything serious right now but i did want to kiss him. so that started and it kind of grew from there. in the beginning it started slow, i believe he had some performance anxiety so i just helped in any way i could to comfort him and help him so he didn't have any anxiety. after a while of helping him and taking it slow it was amazing, actually the first person i've ever been with to help me finish, so that's a huge step for me as well. the amount we hung out increased exponentially from about once a week to 3-4 times a week, resulting in me staying the night. he cooks dinner 98% of the time for me and just hang out watching tv or playing games, and lots of physical stuff which is amazing. getting to know each other more i found out he hadn't been with someone for 4-5 years before me, and he hasn't been in a lot of relationships because he never developed serious feelings for people. this wouldn't bother me so much except i started developing feelings for him. he's one of the sweetest guys i've ever met and everyone we work with says the same, that he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. in the beginning when we said we didn't want anything serious i told him i would tell him if i developed feelings or changed about wanting something serious so we could avoid anyone getting hurt. one of the last times we hung out i mentioned to him that i liked him and we need to talk about what we want to do. he said that we should just enjoy the day and talk about it later, so it seems like he's trying to avoid the conversation. been a couple times since and we haven't talked about it yet. it's certainly hard to do because we can't keep our hands off each other. i'm actually pretty crazy about him and i think he likes me, and probably scared or doesn't want to admit it, or maybe still doesn't want anything serious. i'm not sure whether to push the situation more or just leave things as they be and see what happens. i definitely don't want to get hurt again because i've been lead on pretty badly in the past. i don't necessarily want things to end so i'm not sure what to do. tl:dr met a guy at work things grew to fwb which we both agreed we didn't want anything serious which i still don't but i developed feelings, tried telling him i like him and should talk about what to do, i think he likes me back but won't talk about it. should i end it or leave it be?	12
do you ever have a problem with reading a book for the first time after watching a movie? i was just wondering, does anybody else lose interest in the book after watching a movie? for example, i've watched watership down on netflix and really liked it. i wanted to read the book after, because obviously a book is so much more. but i just couldn't get into it.. i knew what happened and it felt like i'm "rewatching" the whole thing. i don't normally rewatch/reread stuff unless i absolutely love it. so i dropped it. it's not the first time this happened either. anyone else have this problem?	10

maybe i suffer from something called visual stress maybe it's just procrastination getting the better of me so today i was on my laptop procrastinating on reddit, just doing whatever when i decided to sit down and actually do some work. that didn't last long. a small block of text into what i was doing, i was having a hard time reading this thing, harder than normal. i start thinking about that, then about why it's hard to read, (there's a whole load of small environmental factors) i notice a bunch of things, it's kinda cold, i'm tired, thirsty, there's a glare which means i have to turn up the brightness of the laptop, then i realise that's not the only thing, text is just hard to read, especially black text, like it's practically moving. then i'm like should it be acting like that so i turn to google, try to describe what the text is doing to the best of my ability (shimmering) search results are in! 'ocular migrain' no 'make text shimmer in css' nope, but that's cool so i'll bookmark that for later 'visual stress' hmm what's this? maybe let's have a look i clicked onto possibly thee most difficult to read web page i have ever laid my eyes on, light blue bold comic sans to appeal to ~~children~~ parents? this page mentions movement and jumping and a few other things about text but tbh no 'shimmering' like how i'd describe it. another much more normal and easier to read website on visual stress tells me all the things about text but also says people have trouble interpreting stairs? or something and they see colors and straight edges move (and probably acid drops are a thing or something because it's sound like people be tripping with this issue) so then i forget about it and frantically finish what i was doing. later that day yet again im procrastinating it pops into my mind again, so i google a test, and to be fair this is probably the only website on this topic that put any thought into the design of the website to actually accommodate someone with difficulty reading and better yet is also a knowledge that adults may be looking for answers. so i did the test but honestly i don't have a clue, i just wanna know is it normal for text to shimmer when your reading and now suddenly it's way easier to i read with a 'celery' overlay on text... but is this actually something wrong with me is this a dysfunction or just something that everyone experiences, and some just experience it more significantly than others (like their brain has a higher iso or something for all you photography nerds that may be reading or not reading) i'd like to believe everyone has this to some degree but then why is it so hard to find it on google, there's usually all sorts of weird nonsense on google. what are your guys's thoughts? and yes i think i am procrastinating too much	10
embarrassing story from years ago that still makes me cringe in high school back in 2011, i had a crush on this guy in my one class who was nice and cute at the time. my friend knew him and knew that i liked him so i asked if she could find out what he thought of me. when she talked to him and told him i liked him, he responded by saying that he thinks i'm a great girl but he's had a crush on someone else for a long time. i was a little upset but i got over him fast. about a week later, i uploaded an album of random pictures to facebook and was tagging everyone in the pictures on my computer. i got to a picture of just me smiling and a dog licking my cheek. i went to tag myself so i typed in "ma"... and saw my name pop up since those are the first two letters of my name. of course right as i went to click my name, my computer decided to glitch and freeze which caused me to click on the name underneath mine, matt, the guy i had a crush on who had just found out that i liked him the previous week. i quickly tried to untag him but the damage was done and my computer was frozen. i started screaming saying oh my god and my two brothers who i don't usually tell my business to were like "what the hell is wrong with you?" so i went off in a panic and told them all about how this guy knew i liked him and how i accidentally tagged him in this solo picture of myself and the computer won't unfreeze and he probably thinks because i tagged him that means i want him to look at this picture of me and he probably thinks i'm a weirdo. my brothers started cracking up as i'm in a panic trying to restart the computer. this actually took 15 minutes to finally get the computer back to normal and untag him. i was mortified. i was worried that even if he didn't see it yet it probably showed up as "matt was tagged in a photo" on his facebook anyway and other people in our school must have seen it and texted him like "wtf?" so not knowing what to do, i decided to post on his facebook wall telling him something like "haha sorry this just happened! my bad!" the worst part is he never responded to that post... i just went to his facebook wall deleted the post a few days later. we never spoke after that. i don't even know what he's up to nowadays or care to know at all about how he is but at the time it was so painfully awkward and my brothers made fun of me for a while after that. my current boyfriend said if that happened to him he would be convinced that the girl who tagged him must have done it in a desperate attempt for him to see the picture of her....so that obviously made me feel much better about the situation thinking back. that is just one memory from high school that still makes me cringe to this day	11

i love kissing my partner on the lips when she's asleep my partner and i have been together for light years. she always falls asleep before me, and not to long ago i gave her a kiss on the lips while she was sleeping... and she did the cutest ducking thing!! with like a 3 second delay, she did a very sleepy and funny kiss back... now whenever she falls asleep before me, which is every night, i give her a couple kisses and never fail to laugh at how her cute sleeping self kisses me back with like a 3 second delay... she's the best	3
do i break up with him before or after i move out? tl;dr at the bottom. you're probably like "duh, after" but lemme give you some context. please be nice, i'm only just learning about these things since leaving my parents house. very controlling and emotionally abusive people. some revelations i come to might be obvious to some people, but i've not had much experience in this realm. me - f/21 bf - m/21 feb 2018: i broke up with my fiance, the next day i was kicked out of my parents house (long story, i promise i'm not a delinquent), and the day after that i moved in with a guy (current bf) i literally just started seeing (he offered with my asking, i didn't have a place lined up and figured i'd spend most of my time with this guy anyway, so why not crash for a while). he lives in a condo that him and his dad co-own. his dad lives out of state, but controls everything about the condo. no redecorating, no changing the color of the sheets on the bed, nothing. and no pets except our rats that he barely allows us to have. now: we've be dating for a little over a year now. not a ton of red flags either, he's a pretty great guy when things are good and still ok when things aren't. we have tons of fun and laugh a lot, and anxiety isn't a thing when we're together which is huge. anyways, i had this huge meltdown a few weeks ago and mistook my feelings of unhappiness as unhappiness in the relationship, so i told him i miss being single but wanted to talk through our relationship and give ourselves a chance to revive it. i say revive because even though we are the best of friends and we dont have anything to currently argue about, we dont have sex more than once or twice a month. there's no romantic passion and honestly i don't feel sexually attracted to him anymore. we don't kiss except in the morning when i leave for work, and there was rarely any foreplay in sex to begin with. it's like a 5 minute cum-and-go. when we did try foreplay recently, he went on for about 3 minutes and then said i hope that's good enough because anything else is too tiring. how romantic but i still value his company and love to spend time with him, and i explained all of this to him. after thinking long and hard about everything the next day, i realized that i didn't necessarily want to be single, but wanted my own space, my own things, a heckin dog (i've wanted a companion pooch my whole life) and be able to do what i want, when i want. i know this sounds a lot like being single lol, but i still wanted to have him in my life. i told him i felt trapped in the condo because even though it's co-owned, i feel like it's totally his dad's. we can't make it "our" space. he said it's not weird for his to live apart and it'd be fine if i wanted to move out. i'm only moving like 10 minutes away, but he's not sad or anything. kinda weird but whatever. so my move out date is 05/24. i work 8-5 and have chronic pain so we dont do anything during the week. weekends are our days to spend quality time together, and he chooses to sleep all day. i've told him this is hurtful to me, but he does it anyway. this past saturday i told him to please wake up no later than noon so we can spend time together. he sleeps till noon, i wake him up and tell him i wanna go somewhere. hes like, cool but i'm tired and hungry so food first. i'm like, k. he goes back to sleep?? so i make myself breakfast. its 1pm. i wake him up and he goes back to sleep. it's now 2pm, i wake him up and my voice is upset. he finally sits up but doesnt say anything to me for like 15 minutes when he would usually talk to me, cuddle or just at least acknowledge me. so i'm pissed, i go upstairs to cool off instead of fighting. he calls my phone and basically tells me i'm being emotional, creating a problem and it's irrational for me to be upset. we go back and forth for about 30 minutes and then theres a few minutes of silence. i hang up. we haven't spoken to each other more than the necessities since then and we live in the same damn house. he hasn't slept in bed with me since then either. all this to say, i love him dearly and i'm hurt by his reaction to me wanting to spend time with him. tl;dr our expectations of a relationship are different. we are wonderful friends but a romantic relationship is just stressful, and not right for us. i want to break up, but do i do it before or after i move out? i dont want to seem like in was waiting to move out to ditch him, but i'm not sure if breaking up before is bad etiquette. help	12
could really use some positive vibes right now i literally have the biggest test of my life tomorrow (it determines whether or not i get into nursing school) and i've come down with an awful stomach virus. i can't reschedule my test and the next test date isn't for 2 months so i have to tough it out anyways, i'd really appreciate happy thoughts and really anything to get my mind off the stress of knowing i won't be at my best.	4
what do you do on a low-key weekday off? what do you guys like to do when you have a quiet weekday off by yourself? it's a monday for me (tomorrow) so everyone else i know will be at work. i don't mind being alone. i had a busy, very social weekend. i usually use these days off for errands or getting myself organised for the week. i plan on doing some loads of laundry (linen and towels), clean out my fridge, go to the gym and begin to pack my suitcase for my upcoming 2 week holiday. with remaining time after that i will probably nap or watch netflix	6
shoutout to my arms for always being by my side haha...	7
last year i sold the viola that created my fondest memories to date, and i regret it. i played viola seriously from middle school through college, and was always proud of my skills. some of my fondest memories are from playing. but i had to stop because of neck and shoulder pain. having the viola mostly seemed to haunt me, as i always felt guilty for not picking it up again and just trying to improve my posture. but eventually i decided to be practical and get rid of sentiment. it was a $2000 instrument after all. so i sold it for about $700 (wear and tear, you know..). i bought a fairly decent violin for $300, and paid bills with the rest. violins are lighter and shorter and thus less strain on the neck. but its not that viola. and any violists will know what i did is sacrilegious i miss it.	9
telling an old man he was gonna die soon this literally just happened, i'm currently watching him pull out of our driveway as i'm typing this. so this very old gentleman came into the establishment in which employs kind young gentlemen such as myself to do the heavy lifting & such. well i'm at the register so this old soul can pay for his plants & chicken feed & his total comes to 9.04. i tell the gentleman i have the 4 cents right here so 9 bucks is fine. he insist he has the change in his pocket as most people do when i tell them this (i think people really are not fond of carrying loose change in their pocket & it's a chance to rid yourself of some, i do this as well). anyways, the elderly gentleman begins to dig in his pocket & is persistent he has the 4 cents but this man is having a hell of a time getting to the change i hear jingling in his pocket. like his whole forearm is damn near buried in his pocket fighting to get the 4 pennies to pay the complete total. i again, being the nice young gentleman proceed to tell this man with a smile on my face that "it's not a problem at all sir we won't hold it against you one bit. besides, it's not worth the little time you have left to concern yourself over 4 pennies" it was like i physically watched the words leave my mouth & tried to pull them back but it was too late, i said it & i truly didn't know how it sounded until i said it. i was genuine & really just trying to tell him it's no big deal. now the girl who works with me, i just saw her mouth open like "omg no you did not just say that" & we locked eyes for a second & she gave me that face you see a mom give their misbehaving child in a grocery store, not quite as angry as the grocery store mom, you know the one i'm talking about. so about this time the guy pulls out a nickel & tells me to "keep the extra penny, an old feller on his last leg may need it one day" & i just say softly thank him & get his stuff for him. as we're approaching his truck outside he spots my pack of cigarettes i reach for & tells me "keep on smokin' them dudes right here & who knows we may have the same amount of time left ya never know" & laughs as he gets in his truck while i awkwardly pull a turkish royal from the pack to light & force a laugh out still haven't went back in to see what coworker has to say about it, she'll probably just make fun of me & tell our boss (her grandfather) who will also probably make fun of me haha i felt so bad & embarrassed but it was a very bad choice of words on my part. although he seemed to take it lightheartedly, or at least it seemed that way. hopefully he understood i didn't mean it that way (but what else could i possibly mean besides you're old & gonna die soon) so yeah that's why i don't say things out loud in public. on the plus side i made one extra cent so, more profit babyyyy 🏼 tl;dr - i told an old man it's not worth his time digging in his pocket for 4 cents because he was going to die soon.	18

i'm i the legendary gaybay with gaydar? this is by no means a offensive post towards gay people. i am not trying to label those people with "gay". we should be cool with the word "gay" because it has practical meanings apart from being a label. i'm very happy to know these people. i appreciate every kind soul on the earth. alright, back to the subject. this is what i've just found recently. and it is a long process to get the conclusion. so i first heard about gay about 8 years ago when i was in the middle school. my best friend shared a gay themed novel with me and i started to know something about gay. when i was in high school, i had my first internet friend and we ended up being very close, oneday he told me he's gay. and that's the first gay friend i had. we are still very good friends till now. in the high school i had a male friend, he started to ask me to find him a boyfriend after he found out i was very gay friendly. and he then gradually became a "openly gay" boy in the class. everybody was cool with it and we all shipped him and his deskmate. lol miss the good old time. then there's another guy from high school, we were not very close back in the high school but one day after graduation he told me that he's gay and i said i'd always be there if he needed. 4 years ago i started my university. my first close friend in university is my roommate. she told me she's into girls one night when we were sitting beside the playground and talking about our dreams, futures and stuff. then two years ago a new roommate moved in, and we became friends very quickly. a few months ago she suddenly told me she was dating a girl when we were talking about video editing. i majored in administration in school of management in my first year of university. i got to know a guy from the same school and one day he told me he's struggling because he started to have a crush on a middle-aged professor. he wanted to know if there's anything wrong with him and how to deal with the situation. i told him he's fine and gave some suggestions. i changed my major in the second year and now majoring in filmmaking. i met a guy from the animation club and we added each other on social media. but we have never interacted with each other. a few weeks ago we found we were in the same music class and we started to talk. a long time ago i checked his relationship page and noticed they are using the pictures of two main characters from a gay themed tv show as their profile pictures. i thought it was his girlfriend who wanted to use the pictures which was a common phenomenon. now back to today, i asked him about the profile picture very casually. i asked "are you a big fan of the show or is your girlfriend the fan? i noticed you have been using it for a long time. i like the show very much too." he said "i am the fan, so is my boyfriend." then we started to talk about he's boyfriend. jes, they are both very amazing people. now i find i have a big group of gay friends. is there something chemical happening here? i am a openly lgbt supporter on all my social media so i guess they feel like to be friends with me because i'm a known lgbt friendly person. but i think the probability of meeting gay people is too high here with me. even some of my best friends started to call me a gaybay with gaydar. dose anyone has the similar experience? also, i found i alway encounter gay people very randomly on the internet. i like photography and i photograph my friends sometimes and before we go to the location. i'd look for some reference poses and compositions on the internet and mostly instagram. 40% of the photo i clicked on belong to gay people's account. so it's true that gay people are really good at art or it's just me having a gay taste? and i have never been a true fan of any singer or band. i sometimes click on the singer's profile while listening to his/her songs. then i'd search them on google if i found them interesting. and there's a good chance that the artist is gay. i can't remember how many artists that i found gay accidentally. some of them are very famous and some have little fame.	1
what do you think i lived at home for 2 years and manage to save up to $20.000 in my savings. i've been married for about 3 years and brought it up to $45,000. my wife put in 5,000 to bring it up to 50k.. recently she went behind my back, took alt 50k out the savings account and used it to pay off all of her student loans. needless to say i am furious over it. yes i understand marriage is not about one person but seeing as how i atone put the 45k in, the least she could have done was consult with me before making such a big decision. now i am considering divorce. what do you guys think i should do?	10
my boyfriend sleeps too much so my boyfriend \[23m\] and i \[21f\] don't live together and don't get to spend as much time together as we'd like to. usually when we do hangout, he'll just come over and we'll hang out. a lot of the times when we're watching a movie or chilling on the couch, he just falls asleep, for the whole night (until about midnight-ish) and wakes up to leave like nothing happened. no apology or care that the whole night i've just been watching a movie pretty much by myself while my head rested very uncomfortably on his arm. i sort of sighed as he was waking up and he asked me what was up. i told him he pretty much slept the whole time we were together, but he didn't respond. as he was putting on his jacket to leave i asked, "don't you have anything to say?" which was my way of asking for an apology. he then apologizes in such an insincere tone, and starts accusing me of not appreciating his time to come over to see me, and gets pissed at me, making up excuses like, "you could have woken me up" and "well you choosing a movie that would make me sleep doesn't help" like omg. this happens way too often and i always point it out to him that it bothers me and that i wish he didn't fall asleep. another one of his arguments was, "if you came over to my place and you were tired i'd let you sleep". tl;dr - my boyfriend comes over just to fall asleep and feels no shame and accuses me of not appreciating his time. what do i do?	7

do you ever see a random person and think about a life together with them and marrying them cause i do	3
listen up people. listen up ladies and men. this is a serious topic. you have the right form your own opinion but listen to mine first. first topic: i am tired of people judging females for being "gross" or "unhygienic" when they don't shave. this is absolutely ridiculous. a woman can do whatever she wants to her body and shouldn't be judged. you want to let your unibrow grow? let it grow! don't want to shave your armpits? no one is stopping you! tired of shaving your arms and legs? then stop. do not let anyone tell you otherwise. you are not ugly, you are natural. how dare people judge women for something they want to do with their bodies. topic two: [serious] no man should ever be in control of another woman's body. yes, i'm talking about rape and abortion. how dare you judge a woman for saying she's been raped. i fucking hate the lines "she had it coming" or "if you're dressing like that, it'll happen." no matter how she's dressed it shouldn't ever happen. if a woman is raped and gets pregnant, how dare you try take her right to abort the clump of cells inside her. it is her body. there is rape and incest in the world and not only that but there are girls who get pregnant from age 8-16 and that breaks my heart that people are trying to make abortion illegal. (one girl got pregnant when she was barely 5. let that sink in.) the obvious: yes i know women fake rape allegations and it's disgusting and they should be thrown into prison. yes i know abortion is a hard topic and there's many mixed feelings about it. yes i know men can be raped too and you're gonna say "what about men??" let it grow baby. in conclusion: let's all be hairy if you want to be and respect other people's decisions to do whatever they want to their bodies. p.s: i am a feminist but i'm not a nazi-feminist that thinks all men should be killed. men are beautiful. love ya'self.	3
got lasik today, best decision i've ever made! i've worn glasses since i was 11 and i've wanted it since then, but got told i needed to be 21 for my eyes to be fully developed to qualify. well, i'm less than a month off 21 and had it done today! i'm sensitive to light but my vision is now 20/20. of course my grandparents and aunt are coming to visit tonight, who all don't believe in it. as in, they think it doesn't work. so that's going to be fun	12
does anyone want to be reddit pals? i used to have a friend on tumblr i'd message every few months to check in on. we were never very close, but it always felt cool to have someone text you out of the blue every quarter or so asking how everything's been and if you're alright. does anyone wanna do this with me? it's very low effort and just a cool addition to normal life, and it's comforting that someone across the globe thinks about you once in a while. thanks!	3
25m i told a girl 24 f i like that i liked her and she gave me a "maybe later" type of answer. do i still have a chance or did she politely reject me? was my attempt crappy? **tl;dr** a girl who i'm really into gave me maybe somewhere down the road we can give it a try type of answer because she lives in my old home state but she wants to move eventually to where i live for her own reasons not cuz of me she was in a relationship but it went bad and told me she needs time to heal but she said maybe if i move over there we could see where things can go was that's a polite rejection or do i still have a possible chance? here's the exchange via facebook message me: but on the matter of being honest i won't beat around the bush i know my timing isn't the greatest on this but considering what you've gone thru i figure its only fair for me to be honest with you i'm pretty attracted to you. you're extremely cool and easy to talk to we both have similar interests both love our sox and pats and both come from the two same places i mean that's rare if you think about it. i'm sorry for saying it this way but i just wanted to be upfront and real with you. her: ya i agree it is pretty rare! we might be able to have something one day if we tried. we'll have to hang out when we get a chance! i'm not against giving it a try if there's something to make work! i just don't want to hurt anyone while i'm still healing so it might not be right away! but thanks for saying something, i didn't expect anyone to like me lol. i appreciate honesty and confidence hopefully one day when i finally move to mass we'll have a better opportunity to see where things go me: and i 100% get that your still healing but maybe for the sake of slowly getting to know each other better and seeing if their could be something how about we exchange numbers and see where it goes? her: ya sure! i'm a terrible responder, as long as i'm sitting i text back lol i'll be late but better than never haha. (phone number given) so do i still have a possible shot or am i just fooling myself ? because i really do like her and i'm honestly willing to wait and try to keep her interested.	6

i've been told i'm funny, bubbly, kind, friendly, open, nice, and yet i can't keep friends or get close to anyone without feeling like it's forced and uncomfortable. how do i find that someone i'll feel so comfortable with without having to force it versus forcing myself to ignore the discomfort and be closer to them just because i want to be close to _someone_ even if i'm not comfortable with them entirely :( ?	12
confidence boost although i'm very careful who i share with, i do belief taking nudes is confidence booster! anyone else agree?? if i'm ever "feeling myself" sometimes i like strip down, maybe even change into a particularly sexy outfit and take some pictures. i think it's great for someone to have self confidence. for me it wasn't easy. i have felt not good enough, not skinny enough ect. now i'm at place where i know i'm a pretty girl and i have a nice shape. yes, sometimes i catch myself comparing my body to other women or looking in the mirror poking and pointing, but i like to remember as long as i am healthy, i am enough i encourage women and men to find what makes you feel good and sexy! i know when i get all dolled up and have my full face of makeup on that took me about a hour, cute outfit and heels... i feel super sexy! i know i look hot. i love when i catch myself in the mirror and just think "man i look really good today!" i might even check myself out or when i take a glance at myself while changing and just feel super hot, i'll snap some pics! i love compliments and i think they are great but for me nothing is better then the feeling of knowing you look beautiful and really nice. just yesterday this lady was going on about how pretty my face was. it made me smile and i really appreciated it! what is even better though, i didn't need her compliment to make me feel pretty because i already felt that way! i may sound vain and conceited to some but it took me a long time to truly love myself and believe i am beautiful! i am super happy with myself and love my new mindset! even when i wake up in the morning with stinky breath and crazy hair, i may now feel beautiful in that moment but i still know i am!!!	1

what do you use as a bookmark? hi fellow book lovers! after many years of drooling over the folio society catalogue i finally pulled the trigger and ordered some books which i'm super excited about. since this will be my first taste of a higher end book edition i started wondering if there are any do/don't in terms of bookmark usage? mostly in terms of potentially damaging the paper. since i spent so much money on these books i want to care for them as much as possible within reason. also, are there any companies that sell high end bookmarks that anyone could recommend? i typically just use a scrap of white paper but it would be nice to have something nice to go with my pretty books what do you guys use/suggest? thanks in advance!	1

okay, so, i'm really fucking mad okay, so one night i'm on my phone in my room. i get tired so i decide to put it away, i don't want to be tempted so i put it in the living room where my mom is sleeping. i wake up and check my phone, app store is gone, discord is gone, restrictions are placed everywhere on my phone. my mom tells me that she went into discord and found porn so she added restrictions. little bit of prefix to this discovery, i had absolutely nothing to do with the porn section on the discord server. meaning that my mom opened my phone, went directly into discord, switched to the porn section and claimed that i put all of it there. now i have to ask her permission to download ducking candy crush. this is such a huge invasion of my privacy and i hate every second of this torturous existence. it's so incredibly unfair and i have no one to talk to it about, so have fun reading my rant r/teenagers, i would appreciate several f's. thanks	3
so some of you may remember a week or two ago i asked if i should ask my crush out... she said yes!	19
reddit save my relationship three years ago, i met a fat cute nerd in my highschool, he was cute and pretty fun and i just came out a big depression ( i was 14 and ive been already abused) and i needed a boyfriend so i didn't choose the nerd ( gonna call e) and i choose a random dumb boy. during two years, we were friend and he had a little crush on me but nothing serious . last year, his mother invited me by politness in their familial vacations' house bc i invited him to my father home. that was the best summer of my life, i enjoyed his big brother, his mom his little sister, his grand ma and grand pa even his stupid cousin . we were with our best friend and i was just totally happy. i cried a little bit in the trains of back but i was full of good memories, i think he falled in love ( again) a little bit but i had a 9 years older boyfriend during thid period. i left my big boyfriend and after a communist party, his mother bring us and paid us burger king. my mother din't came to bring me home so i asked if i could sleep, his lovely mother said " of course ". his siblings'rooms were empty but i prefered to sleep with him and ... i kiss him. we were in his beds kissing each other. and after... i screw up. i prefered my sex plan, i leave him 2 times and i had an other boyfriend ( very stupid). he dated a younger insane girl to the museum during my concert. i cried. i shouted on my boyfriend for and i broke up with him immediately when i realized i was in love with e. my mother said " you are in lovr and it's obvious ". everybody knew i was in love, all our friend my mom my brother except him. but it was too late, he dated the crazy loli. i tooke some weed in class for forget. i was high in school and even my philosophy teacher saw it. i hated myself and this bitch was with the guy i loved. but one night we gi together to my father's home ans that was... magical. the time was stopped and we were dating together. i knew he had reddit and one evening i found a post on this sub and he was saying things so adorable about me that i cried and called her saying " i did the good choice "	3
i miss being happy this time last year i was so happy. i had started a new job & was seeing money i never had before, got back with my bf so we were in the infatuation phase again. started taking trips with him & going out more and on top of that i was a size 6, the smallest i've been since high school. now i feel like i'm depressed. i gave birth march of this year, i try to lose the weight but it sticks. i feel unattractive. i'm a size 12 now & my shift at my job changed to overnight & i always have to stay & do ot which is great money but it tires me out from being with my daughter. since having the baby my bf & i haven't been on the best terms & we fight almost every week. so much has changed & i don't blame my baby, i love her dearly & i'm grateful for her. i know it's possible to have kids & still be happy & enjoy life. i just wish i could get to the root of my unhappiness	2

my (30f) boyfriend (32m) of 1 month (i know, i know) started acting distant and this week saw 2 movies at the theater and went kayaking today with his "best friend" (??f) of 6 months. i mean, i think the answer is probably obvious and i'm just struggling to let this go because the first 3 weeks were so fun. but it just stopped, seemingly all of the sudden. and now he's hanging out with this chick he claims is "like family" and i've never felt like the jealous type, but we don't go to movies, never mind go kayaking. everyone is saying "dump his ass." i don't know why i'm struggling so much to do so. i guess i just wish it could go back to how it was. it's so strange to me how it could be so good then suddenly so stale. saturday is his birthday. what do you think?	2

complimenting a walmart employee ok, quick backstory: i work nightshift (usually 12-14 hours) in a fairly mentally draining field, so usually i go straight home after work, eat a bowl of cereal while browsing reddit, and crash. today i decided that i needed some monster more than an extra 30 minutes of sleep, so i headed to the store. after i had gotten my monster and some candy that was enticingly displayed in my path, i started heading towards the checkout. i made eye contact with a walmart employee who was (i thought) sitting on a crate restocking bread rolls. he was middle aged and had these really cool kneepads on, and i guess i stared at them long enough he sensed me looking at him because he looked up and made eye contact. my social skills made a break for my frontal lobe and made contact *juuust* long enough for me to wonder if i was being creepy. so, stupidly, i decided to say something. "hey man, your kneepads rock!" *thanks brain, you idiot. what am i, a hippy? oh wait, i need to smile, you're supposed to smile with compliments* *full two second delay, then:* this guy just looks at me. no expression, just blank stare. i thought maybe he didn't hear me *(bad! bad brain!)* and tried again. i went for something shorter, because i was still walking past him to the checkout. "cool kneepads man!" ok, all you poor saps that work with people (retail/service/etc.) know exactly what i'm talking about when i say that this guy gave me the teeth-only doesn't-reach-the-eyes smile you do when someone says something and you can't actually say what you're thinking. "thanks." i don't think i've ever heard someone end their sentence with such finality. i shrugged it off as "eh, people work sucks" and kept walking. as i passed him, i caught a flash out of the corner of my eye. something looked weird so like the nosy, awkward person i am i circled back around the next aisle, casually stood behind a stack of bread crates, and looked down the aisle at the guy. he's not sitting on a crate. he's in a wheelchair, and while i was creepily staring i noticed that he wasn't moving his legs at all - he actually paused what he was doing to make sure his foot was on the footrest. *oh. ohhhh.* *brain sputters to life: ....oh no!* i decided not to make it worse and fled to the checkout. by the time i was out to my car i was convinced this poor guy who already has to deal with paralyzed legs and working at walmart thought i was making fun of him when the skater in me really did think he had cool kneepads. walmart dude, if you're reading this - i'm sorry man. thanks for not being mean, you really did have awesome kneepads. tl;dr: i tried to people at the end of a long shift, ended up accidentally mocking a disabled person, and made his shift that much worse.	19

seven year anniversary on this day, seven years ago, i tried taking my own life. thanks to the love and support of the amazing people around me, and the strength i've bolstered from within, i am still alive today. on and off for the last decade i have struggled with depression. it seems that every three years my life fell apart. a cycle which started back in highschool. i was considering suicide in 2009, but then it turned around when i fell for someone i thought was special. the relationship lasted a while, but inevitably failed, and in 2012 i actually attempted suicide. obviously, i survived, and i very slowly moved on and found reasons to live. friends and family being the most prominent of those. then, in 2015, once again my life crumbled as three members of my family all passed away, including my father. that became the worst year yet, but i found a way to push forward. later that year, i fell head over heels in love with the love of my life. everything felt like it was finally getting better, but then the cycle struck me one more time. last year, i suffered the worst year of my entire life. our relationship fell apart, and i was forced to face the only imagineable hell i've ever known. this year i am taking a stand, and i've been fighting back. i've said it before, but for the first time in the last decade i genuinely enjoy life. the happiest moments of my life happened in the last few years, but i've never felt as genuinely healthy and just generally well as i do now. i'm on the cusp of happiness, finally, and i have never felt this sort of balance before. thought i'm still struggling, i am proud to have the amazing support system i have in all of you. with much thanks to my friends, family, and loved ones, i can finally see myself becoming the best iteration of myself ever. some day soon, i hope my stars will align. with a heart so massive and pure as gold, i live to share it with everyone. to anyone i've ever hurt, i'm truly sorry, but please know that i am still becoming a better person, and have room to grow. i am loved, and i love all of you with all of my heart. to all of you who have stood by me and supported me through the years...thank you.	3

i wanna fucking die. dysphoria+depression+anxiety be doin a wombo combo right now fucking kill me. i wanna fucking die.	0
really stupid idea, no good way to ask okay, so like 2 years ago i dated this girl, absolutely loved her to death. long story short, she cheated on me with like 6 different guys, maybe more only caught the like 6. so she was super loose. now she's married and has a kid. i'm happy for her, we actually traded messages and buried the hatchet and it gave me a lot of closure. now, i have no interest whatsoever in intruding on her relationship or engaging in any sexual contact with her. that being said, fucking her was some of the best memories of my life. i mean i just loved having sex with her. here's where it gets awkward/weird. she sent me nudes when we were together and i deleted them when i was heartbroken because i didn't want to succumb to my emotions and post them online. however, and this is a little personal, i always think of fucking her when i jack off. like pretty much any time i jack off, fuck, or what have you, i try to perfectly remember when we were fucking, i know that's probably pretty normal, if not a little weird i guess. i remember when we were together, however, that she told me she used to camgirl for some extra cash. would it be too weird for me to ask her what her name was as a camgirl? like i have no interest in a relationship with her, i literally just want to beat my dick and perfectly remember what she looked like when i was fucking her. i mean, she took the vids/pics before she met her husband, and i've already literally penetrated her anally (not to be too crass), so what's the harm? i don't really care too much about keeping contact with her if it creeps her out or disgusts her. so should i just ask and take the chance? idk, is this too far or too weird? i mean it's not like she hasn't fucked dozens (maybe hundreds) of guys, and i'll likely never even see her in person again, much less touch her. i just really wanna remember what she looked like riding me down to the moles. fuck, this sounds like a troll, but i'm dead serious. thoughts/advice?	1

you can't "sound gay" i would like to preface this post with the following, masculinity is a myth, you cannot "sound gay" and i have absolutely nothing against gay people. so i'm not quite sure if it's because i'm a late bloomer but i have been asked if i'm gay almost 15 times this week. when i say no, even though i am still trying to explore my sexuality i do identify as straight for the most part, they say, "are you sure? you sound pretty gay." i get the feminine stereotype of people who are gay but this is just getting old. i have not problem with people asking me what my sexuality is but then people almost tell me what my sexuality is. and the people who ask me this are like the no personality party kids who think its cool to drink till you have to be brought to the hospital, so there usual outlook on gay people is, "yeah if you where gay i'd have to beat you up." i even met this kids who said all gay people should be killed along with the jews. tldr; you are the only one who can decide your sexuality. don't listen to anyone else if they say you "sound gay" bc to me you sound pretty fucking cool	0

me fiance (f26) would save her best friend (m26) from a burning house and not me (m28). silly question. but it wonders my mind though. the mind can play tricks on you , so please don't bash me if my mind played me, just point it out so me and my fiance were playing some question and answer game. and i pulled the question "who would you save from a burning building ? me or your best friend?". to which she replied her best friend . i kinda shook this off and replied that i hoped never to be in the same burning building, as that guy, then. a bit extra information unrelated to this (since that was something silly and cringeworthy) . today that best friend let's call him mark. posted some photos of my fiance and him online (not that it matters but about 50%of his posts are with her)with the caption "true friendship is when you understand and are understood" . not going to lie mark genuinely is amazing and i am sure he respects our relationship. but this quote annoyed me a bit because when we have a fight she sometimes says "you don't understand me , i wont share anything with you anymore". and then reading this post from mark and the fact that she shares everything with him (which i am glad for. everyone should have a close friend from the opposite sex to have another view on things and share wjth) but the fact she shares everything single detail (even our intimate life, this she also shared with other men) with him and very very little with me. while she knows that i believe a relationship is sharing (not everything obviously). bothers me. there is one last thing , mark ones was engaged (7 years ago they broke up) , now 7 years later she is getting married and he was having difficulties with this. my fiance supported him every day , she called mark hours. i was glad that mark was getting alot of support , i also was thinking 'dude 7 years... really?" but every person is different and react differently aswell , so i won't judge . but then i remembered that when i was having hard times (months before), the loss of close friends, she didn't show support or only did after me bringing up the fact she wasn't being supportive, so it felt forced. but then when mark is dealing with something (and if i'm honest, giving your best friend hours and hours of support because his ex from 7 years ago is getting married , while when your fiance has lost a loved one you only show very little ,and because it only almost came after brining it up, forced support, it just feels wrong to me). i posted this to get it off my chest . also if i would adress this to my fiance , she might take it the wrong way and think i am taking away her freedom (while i actually support her having a close friend) . if i am just losing my mind, woopsie my bad, please make sure you point out that i am overthinking things and should shake it off. tl;dr to sum up : -would save mark and.not me - shares everything with mark (even intimate) and very little with me -alot of support for mark , none or only after bringing it up there was a little bit of support for me.	3

comments on news articles recently i filtered out any reddit posts with the word "trump" in the title, cause it was just too much to deal with. so i get my daily dose of news from google news, and from reuters. every so often i dive into reader comments on news articles. and every time i do, i wind up confused, sad, and troubled. for every well thought out comment, it seems like there's 10 completely horrid, nonsensical, outrageous comments. i can't help but think that maybe all these commenters are bots? maybe they're not actual people posting this stuff? anyone ese get that feeling? on another note...how's everyone's day going? it's friday, and i'm looking forward to a nice weekend.	8
i think i wanna be a nudist? lol hey dudes i'm 13m and i live in florida not too far from a nude beach and i've always thought it would be fun to go but i've been too scared to ask cause most people think that's pretty weird. it came up in a conversation my mom/stepdad were having yesterday so i mentioned that i thought it would be fun to go :) they mostly thought it was funny because i'm really shy and introverted so they didn't take me seriously. but they said if i really wanted to do it, i should go nude at home for a day or two to see if i could handle it. so i'm supposed to try it tomorrow but they said if i go through with it i won't be able to put anything on until wednesday night, like my bedroom door would be locked lol. it probably wouldn't be that bad but my mom got my sister to message a few of our friends that live in our apartment complex about coming over since there would obviously be a lot of people at a nude beach which makes sense but i've never really been naked in front of anyone so i'm really nervous. but should i do it!? idk how they know about it but a lot of my friends are messaging me on facebook telling me i better not back out lol	1

i don't get the fuss so i've gone through a bunch of things this past few months. i was diagnosed with cancer, and as a result, had to stop smoking (smoking wasn't the cause of the cancer, but the smoke would basically kill my lungs and heart during chemotherapy) chemotherapy was shit. i was smelling urine everywhere for a whole week from when i start a session. i really wasn't that afraid, just after some time, my veins would start hurting (same veins where the needle went in) and developed a phobia of needles. with all this now behind me (cured of cancer), i understand how some people say cancer sucks..but honestly it was just the chemo that sucked, being nauseous and shitty. i don't get how people make such a huge deal though, i didn't feel any different (emotionally and physically) during and after treatment, just felt like i have a cold and have to get this needle poked in me every couple of weeks for 6 months. also with the smoking, been 6 months since my last smoke. i don't feel any healthier, i don't smell or taste things better, i feel absolutely no different, other than wanting to have a cig after a nice steak dinner. i had to quit cold turkey, and i did; no big deal. i even have my cig pack on my desk, yet i don't smoke it. tl;dr had cancer, got cured after chemo. i don't understand why people make a huge deal about it. as a result of cancer, had to quit smoking cold turkey with absolutely no issues. i don't understand people	7

spraying deodorant in a particle detector :( this was a week back on a school camp and upon arrival we were shown to our rooms and told "do not spray deodorant in rooms" because they have particle detectors for fires and stuff. me being me decided to test if this was true. i grab my lynx (or axe if american) deodorant and empty half a can right in the vent. well the light started flashing then sirens. all around camp. people rushing to the evac points. some in towels, some in pyjamas. fire brigade showed up and i just hid. lucky i avoided the $1200 aud fine because i came clean and they just gave me cleaning duty. morale is don't test the detectors . tl;dr - i decided to test a particle detector and the fire brigade showed up.	1

i killed a fish today today was the first time in a while that i've been able to go fishing since i had no plans and the weather was nice. so i went out to my backyard where the lake was and fished for a few hours with no luck. finally when i was about to call it a day i caught a bass on a senko and was so excited since i caught nothing all day. but by this time it was really dark outside so trying to get the hook out was difficult. the hook was stuck at the way back of the mouth on its tongue/throat (im not sure what it's called) and i sat there trying so hard to unhook it and i occasionally gave it water to not kill it but eventually i had to run back to the house so i had light to see where and how the hook was stuck. after about 15 min i finally got the hook out but by then the fish had already died. and now i'm sad. rip fish friend i tried so hard to save you buddy anyways i thought this would be the best place to hold his funeral and i thank you all today for coming to honor my fish friend's life and memory. please feel free to share your words of kindness or any stories you have. god bless [pic of fish before his death](<url>)	4

scared my girlfriend may harm herself my (m19) girlfriend (19f) of a year and a half has been having some mental health problems for most of the time that we've been dating and she had a breakdown last night where she was talking about wanting to die and was clearly not okay. hours later after we talked for a really long time and i helped calm her down, she sent me this text and i was hoping to get some perspective on how to help her/ what to do. "so i feel bad about saying that the only thing keeping me from killing myself is the physical pain of actually having to do it. that's not totally true. that is a big reason because what i want is for everything to stop and go black without me having to hurt myself but it's not the only reason i'm still alive. while i know that all my friends would move on just fine and that my family could too, i also know that it would hit you really hard and that it would change your entire life. i never would want to do that to you and that's a huge reason why i haven't done anything yet and probably won't ever. while i don't really care about missing out on my own future, i wouldn't want to take the one that you imagine for yourself away from you. and i really really don't want to say this because it can be seen as emotionally abusing you into staying with me but it really is the truth and that truth is that if i lost you i would lose hope completely, give up on everything, and end it all. i can't see a future for myself that doesn't include you because that future will never become a reality. i'm either with you and making you happy or there's no reason for me to live anymore. so the point of this text is to say i'm sorry if i hurt you when i said pain is my only reason because that's not the truth. i love you and when i say that you mean the world to me, just know that i really really mean that " tl;dr girlfriend is appearing to be suicidal and i want to help her but i don't know how	3
carrying my phone everywhere so it's really windy outside right now and i went to the balcony (2nd floor) to smoke a cigarette. took my phone with me. at some point the strong wind opened the balcony door, so i closed it with one hand while holding my phone in the other hand. suddenly i am not holding my phone in my hand. i can see it bouncing off the balcony fence right onto the concrete fence down in the garden and falling into my neighbors' garden - screen down on the concrete. as if it's not enough, my credit card is in the phone case and i was just about to go shopping. after a moment of shock i go next door to ring the bells of my neighbors. none of the freaking 10 bells works. i try to reach the window and knock it, but i'm too small. i go inside and grab a chair and bring it to the street, looking like an idiot, and try knocking. nothing. i try ringing all the bells again, nothing. i knock on the window again, nothing. i'm trying to understand what the fk just happened. the only thing i figure out is that i'm f*?ked. i'm going to wait outside and hopefully someone comes. tl;dr: dropped my phone from a balcony, can't get it back	19

ex sending mixed signals **me [17m] and my ex [18f] broke up about three weeks ago.** lately she has been really nice and almost flirty in person. like laughing at stuff i da that is not really funny and then reeealy laughing at stuff i say that is. and also like doodling on my paper during class and writing "you suck". (we sit next to each other), pointing out how veiny my arms are . stuff like that. but then not in person she is really cold seeming. like leaving me on read and two or three word answers. not responding to my streaks on snapchat that day "how is everyone doing". it's like she's two different people. **can anyone explain this behavior?** tldr: ex girlfriend is acting different in person vs over text/snap.	17
my mom's parental controll app is no match for me. my mom downloaded this app quistedo or sum shit and essentally it tells her everything i google, what apps i visit, for how long, what i text, my snapchat, but worst of all, 'dramatic music' it limits my time on my phone. i am addicted to my phone. it's an issue i refuse to fix. so the time thing was an issue for me. i, being the addict i am, found a way around it. it won't allow me into settings, so i cant force it to stop. it does not have an uninstall button. but, if a popup add appears, it will block rhe popup and let what is behind it remain. i just got youtube to give me a popup and hit home at the same time and boom. time limiting avoided.	0

mixture of sad and happy i've been talking to a friend i've known for awhile in a more serious manner for a couple weeks and we've started hanging out more 1 on 1. things have literally been so amazing and we actually kissed last night and it's been awhile since i've experienced such a rush of emotions, was honestly amazing. she appreciates me for myself and i feel the same way about her. i'm very thankful for the experience even though it's been short lived. she has plans for her life and will end up moving soon so it's looking like we won't become committed . we talked about it this morning, so i'm just a little bummed out. i'm just really happy that she showed me that there are people who would like me for myself, so for that i am thankful. thank you for reading.	14

sleepwalking not sure if this is a true tifu, but i thought i'd share here anyway because i am slightly perplexed. this "tifu" happened sometime this morning, while i was "sleeping". for the most part, last night was a completely normal night for me. i came home from going out to have chinese for dinner with a friend at around 845 pm, and as usual, i got a glass of water, went into my room, and turned on fifa 17 to play some career mode. at around 10 pm, i climbed into bed, but i wasn't feeling tired, or relaxed, in the slightest. so, i took my new sleeping supplement i just purchased about a week ago (*week ago*). for any fellow insomniacs or redditors who have trouble with sleep, i have started taking alteril, and let me say it is the only, only, sleeping med available otc or online without a script that has ever, ever, actually made me tired. i recommend it 100% to anyone who has trouble getting to sleep, or staying asleep, and doesn't wish to suffer from the possible side effect of racism that comes with zolpidem tartrate. however, this time, i took 4 tablets instead of 2 (twice the normal serving size) because my impatient ass wanted to get to sleep quickly and figured this was the way to go about expediting the shut eye process. it seemed to have worked. i fell asleep after about 20 minutes post ingestion, which is a small miracle for me on nights that i have troubles, and woke up at about 6am, feeling refreshed. happy that i appeared to have gotten a good night's rest, i sprang out of bed to go make my morning coffee. as i stand up, oddly enough i'm greeted first with the smell of urine. thinking "great, i'm 22 and i pissed the bed", i press my nose against the sheets like a 5 year old window shopping, but i don't smell piss at all, i smell lavender. these, are not r kelly's sheets. confused, and slightly disturbed, i start trying to locate the source of the smell. finally, my eyes fall on my water glass that i had gotten the night before, which was empty upon me falling asleep, as i had drank all the water. the glass, however, was not empty. it was full, to the brim. it was full to the brim with a yellow tinged liquid. "maybe i didn't finish my water", i thought, "and the yellow is just my lamplight reflecting on the glass". so i timidly inch my nose closer to the glass, and a strong stench of urine wafts though my nasal passages. without a hint of self awareness, i think, "someone fucking got up in their sleep and pissed in my god damn glass". i waited until the others that live in my home were awake, and asked if any of them knew if they were prone to sleepwalking. to my dismay, they all said no, and added that sleepwalkers aren't quiet, and if anyone would've "sleepwalked" into my room and pissed in my god damn water glass, surely it would've woken me up as they would've had to open the door, and there are many things on the floor in between the door and my nightstand. to my knowledge, i also have no history of somnambulism. now perplexed, i started thinking, and my mind eventually falls on the alteril. i had taken 4, instead of 2, and alteril is a full strength (and all natural ) blend of many ingredients that often make up their own pills by themselves. the main ones being melatonin (4mg per 2 tablets) and l-tryptophan (666mg), which are alongside a 260mg proprietary blend of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) and several plant extracts, including passionflower and valerian root. as of right now, this is the only explanation i can come up with as to how a full glass of urine ended up on my nightstand whilst i was "sleeping". **tl;dr** i consumed 2 servings of alteril, my new sleep aid, and ended up pissing in my water glass while sleepwalking. lucky me, i avoided becoming racist and joining twitter. *here is the link to the supplement if anyone is interested in joining me in using their drinkware as a latrine: <url>	6
what's a weird thing you only do around with or around your family? i'm bored as all get out waiting on an oil change and was thinking about this. what my brother, mom, and i do: speak in exaggerated irish accents and say weird irish phrases my mom has taught us my mom is from the north side of dublin and moved to the us nearly 40 years ago. despite this she still has a bit of an accent. it strengthens when she talks to family back home, but also when she does her exaggerated voice. she will tease my brother and i with these phrases or she and her sister will talk in it. phrases include: 'you bloody/bleedin idjit' 'well isn't it well for some' 'you'd persecute a saint' 'was dah' (what's that) 'you're full of shite' and more. sometimes we just talk in the accent/voice. i don't know if these are specifically irish things but it's just what we've picked up from her. i wouldn't dream of doing this around other people. besides them i just talk like this to my cat. what are weird things you do/say only with your family? or friends if you prefer?	1

performing my own skin graph tifu by giving myself a skin graph... well, actually, it was about 40 years ago, but a post i read today reminded me of when i was around 12 or 13 years old and was always getting into accidents and trouble. i was on a classic minibike, which, at the time was like a lawnmower with wheels testing its limits and i took a corner a bit too fast. at about 30mph and completely out of control, i ran into the back of an old, 1959 cadillac deville with the big, pointy, populuxe tail fins. well, the tail fin impaled my side like an icepick and created a nasty, bloody hole - mostly fat and skin - that probably could have used more than a few stitches. at the time i had "summer feet" and surfer calluses on my heals that formed a nice thick layer of (dead) skin - the best place to harvest my own tissue! so, what does a young, scared-of-his-parents kid who was force fed "marcus welby, md" for years do? he operates! i peeled off a solid piece of heel with an old potato peeler (no blood!) and soaked it in alcohol - one of my dads 16 oz busch beers - then rinsed it off in our over chlorinated pool and butterflied the "patch" onto my festering wound with a little red iodine. it took - yes it took ... it took three days before it was fully and painfully infected and boy, was i in trouble then, tho i think that my mom was also a little bit impressed.	8
superstore - why is this show not a massive hit everywhere? so i've been watching this show superstore on amazon prime it stars america ferreira (ugly betty) and a few unknowns it's absolutely hilarious. hands down one of the best american sitcoms i've watched in a long time. completely dry, ridiculous when needs to be and you just wanna binge this show. also, there's a guy called glenn that i was convinced was kermit the frog! cannot recommend a show more. no live studio audience, no canned laughter, it feels fresh despite being set in a supermarket (traditional setting) not sure if big in the usa or not but here in the uk it's not really known about just my thoughts	8

introducing the bf to reddit nsfw tifu - i love reddit - i'm a whole 6 yrs reddit old. i loose entire night shifts here. in august i met my current bf. i've been talking about reddit to him since early in our relationship. and he often catches me giggling at something and wants to know what it is. and reddit - to the uninitiated can be hard to describe. today he decided to join (for something to do when he has a smoke at work - lmao). i warned him. but he did it anyway. he is u/gdp74 (welcome baby). happy cake day! it took him a total of 8 seconds to find r/trashy and subsequently porn. he's now cruising cat videos. i've lost him.

i (21m) am in one hell of a love triangle and could use some advice on what's wrong with me. i am a 21 year old guy living in ca i'm in the military and i have about 8 months left before going back to ny. if you read my previous post, you know i have a girl i met here and we're currently working on being just friends and it's going ok but i am in love with her. here's where it gets weird, i've also been talking with another 21 year old (f)emale and me and her get along great although she's very flaky. she's canceled on me 3 times (including tonight) and has told me i'm not her type (not a skinny, college educated boy ) which is fine i'm not looking to date but the more she flakes the more i'm attracted to her which i find really weird. and when she told me i wasn't her type that made me like her a lot more too. now tonight i went to a local bar and had a great time with my boys and it ended with a stupid ass fight and i met this beautiful short hispanic woman who is 26 years and a mother of 2 with an 11 year old. (i didn't know all this until later btw) we went out to eat at a diner and talked and i really vibed with her even with the current baby daddy drama and the kids and i'm actually about to see in her in about 2 hours for some fitness thing. basically i just need to know if this is normal, if i'm being rational or acting on a broken heart. i don't want to hurt any of these girls and i don't feel like i will but i would like someone to tell me this is normal and i won't hurt anyone. if you believe i will, let me know and i will tell them that i'll stop talking to them. (btw all of them know i'm leaving california in november) tl;dr: in a love triangle with old flame, fwb, and newly met single mom, need advice to avoid hurting them!	1

my doggo did a thing so its currently 12:54 in the morning and one of my dogs just climbed into my bed. mind you this dog is 96 pounds. i told him to get off because i was trying to sleep/watch youtube and he wanted to play with the ball. he then retaliates by pooping on my floor and as i went out the door to get a bag to put it in he pushed the door closed causing me to smack my head on the door. i love my dogs but why you have to bully me like this	4
caught partner in another lie about the past. what do? tldr is the title, pretty much although i'll add that that when the lie was uncovered, he deflected it onto me and was more concerned about potentially upsetting someone from the past he no longer sees, than very visibly upsetting his girlfriend (me) there and then. so i've been seeing someone for just over a year, things moved along quickly and although i've been struggling with severe clinical depression and not always been able to be the partner i want to be, i try my best and i thought that things were pretty good. recently he mentioned that someone he was acquainted with from the town he used to live in (he has said she's the friend of an ex/someone he was casually seeing-the definition of that relationship changes) had messaged him on every social media platform he had, saying hello and asking how he was. i thought this was unusual-as far as i was aware, they haven't seen each other in 2 years or more and even then, it was all very vague and not as though they were friend-friends, although it sounded as though she'd been clingy in the past. although i hadn't met her, she definitely sounded weird and needy from what he had said (her middle name on social media is a nickname that he gave her which i thought was pretty cringey in itself) so this unprovoked pushiness threw up some red flags. the timing is terrible-there are some hopefully positive changes happening at the moment, after a run of extremely bad luck and i just can't deal with the hassle of some hanger on with boundary issues lurking in the wings. i figured if she's that pushy with no encouragement, it could easily get worse and i understandably want to avoid any drama and/or stressors after having had a shitty time of it. given my understanding that they were barely acquaintances, i had said 'if it's not that big a deal, why not unfollow her and hopefully the problem is solved'. he visibly changed at this suggestion and kept saying he didn't like not having a choice and that i had just ordered him to delete her (i truly hadn't) and that he wished he hadn't told me about it etc. basically firmly deflecting onto me and in a pretty pissy way. he even said it's because he'd 'feel bad about it if he bumped into her'. i feel that's unlikely, given she lives in a town we've been to just twice in over a year during this, it came out that they *had* been friends and had gone for drinks together etc. and he said he hated it when i was 'digging' and he didn't want to talk about his past. i explained that i was only 'digging' (otherwise known as asking questions for clarification and to check my understanding) because i'd just realised he had been dishonest again and i was wondering what there was to be dishonest about, what i was missing and if i was being made a fool of-pretty reasonable, i thought. more deflecting and pissiness ensued. clearly there is more here than meets the eye but i am not expecting to get a straight or honest answer about any of it. he angrily said 'i just won't talk to her then' but given what's happened this evening, i don't feel i could trust that anyway. i have always respected his right to privacy (i'm very private myself after growing up with little privacy-not to the point of secrecy and deceit though). i explained that i didn't want details of the past-i believe the past should be kept in the past, but it's not easy when the past decides to slide into his dms across multiple platforms. i explained that i was the innocent party, as i feel like this is stirring and that he's taken the bait. i said that he had hurt me by being dishonest in the first place and then being angry with me for being upset about that made it worse, yet he only seemed concerned with his feelings and how he came across. i felt that he was more concerned with her being upset 'if' he saw her in the street, than he was with his girlfriend being very upset, there and then. i came here to ask if i was overreacting, and ask what i should do, but seeing it written down now, i can see that it doesn't look good. i can't be in a relationship with no trust. i didn't sleep last night and have a killer headache. i would really appreciate peoples thoughts/support/encouragement. thank you	11

your boy did it! over the last 2 years, i had a pretty terrible period in my life. was very depressed, had horrible thoughts and i was very underweight. also had a bunch of anxiety, felt like a weirdo, etc etc. i started working out and eating properly, making an effort to be more social etc. it helped immensely on my mental health, and i've gained ~11kg of lean mass since, and around 2 tons of friends if you combine their weight. (lol) this year i went to boarding school, and on 9/11 i kissed a girl for the first time, and we've been together for 5 months now. for the first time in my life, i have a valentine and am genuinely happy :) you can do it too	3

getting high and having sex so first off, i'm sorry for having my first tifu about sex and weed, but i thought this was kinda funny. to start off, me and this girl have been talking to each other for about a week. things start going well and she's sending nudes and being all horny and shit. i, seeing this as an opportunity to get my dick wet, pounce on it like a cat. we hung out today and she asked me before if i wanted to smoke before we fucked. i happily obliged, i mean, free weed is free weed and pussy is pussy. so we are driving along looking for a place to spark and park and we settle **in a fucking church parking lot** that we thought was secluded and safe. so we start lighting up and we are getting pretty high and nobody was around and it was perfect. until i tried to take a massive hit... it always starts off like this, someone thinks they can kill the bowl and they end up coughing their lungs out. i wish it went like that. i light the bowl, and mind you its pretty small) ad all of the sudden i feel something really warm in my left eye. *hm, i guess that feels kinda good*. about 5 seconds later i realize **my fucking contact is being melted**. i quickly took the flame away and took out my contact. yup. fucking melted. shit. but that's only the beginning. so with this contact out of my eye and it being melted to shit, i knew that i couldn't put it back in. mind you, my vision is -9.5/-10. it's absolute piss. so i can only see out of one eye. fuck. we are still in the parking lot, and things start getting hot, and we start fucking. yada yada yada, i don't finish, my dick went limp because i was so high, and she still wanted more. i get out for a piss and as i whip my dick out, a fucking jogger runs through the woods. stares straight at my dick. nothing i could do about it. let it ride. i get back in the car, and she starts smoking. at this point i was coming down and i get super tired during the comedown. i fall asleep for like, ten minutes, and then proceed to get higher. things start going again and we fuck.. again. this time i thought i was a god and just went as hard as possible. she fucking loves it and i put her in a sex coma. bang bang. as she's laying there, i noticed we never rolled up the windows from smoking. no biggie even though she is super loud, i'll just clo-- fuck. it's 6:00, and people are coming to the church for mass. oh my god, there are cars here. everywhere around us. holy. shit. fifty old people just heard and saw us fuck. in the parking lot. of their fucking church. let's get the fuck outta here. we get out of there asap, and park in a supermarket lot to figure out where to go next. still stoned off my ass, i'm kinda rocking back and forth to try and gain sobriety. i tell her, "alright where are we going?" "i don't know you pick." "just pick somewhere." "i dont know ." "do you wanna go home?" "fuck no let's go again!" "i just did all that work, now you wanna go again?!" "pleeeeeease come on give it to me!" "ugh fine start driving." so we are driving along trying to find a better vacant parking lot, and i take out my phone and realize **i've been on the phone with my dad for 5 minutes.** shit shit shit. hang op. hang up hang up!! i still can't see out of my one eye, so it kinda takes a while to find the button. i hang up, turn to her, and start fucking cracking up. i text him and say "oops, i buttdialed you haha my bad." "where are you going?" fuck. well maybe i can play it off. "hahahah starbucks." "sure you are..." ahhhh fuck. he knows. shit. 10 seconds later..." i asked the girl if she could just drop me off at starbucks and she happily obliged. it was a proper shit show. so here i am, high as fuck in starbucks, starving (its been 7 hours since my last meal, half blind, and deading the conversation with my father after this. **tl;dr** got high, burnt my contact, got caught fucking by old people, buttdialed my dad while me and a girl were discussing more sex, and sitting in starbucks alone right now. edit: too high and forgot to label nsfw.. how can i do that now? edit x2: love reading these comments guys!	1
whining like a sick baby cuz i am one i've been sick for the last week. thought i was getting better but today i've been feeling really awful. i haven't taken meds besides ibuprofen but today was too much and i took cough syrup and had to use my inhaler. i hate the shakes that come w using the inhaler. my sides were literally getting achy and fatigued from all the coughing. i have to do some physically intensive work tomorrow with a colleague for a project and if i reschedule it would have to be rescheduled for at least another week which would be really inconvenient for us both so i'm planning on dragging my ass out there tomorrow. i just feel so gross and the idea of getting up extra early to go do physical work is so unbelievably unappealing. my boyfriend was sick w this two weeks ago. he's the one who gave it to me and he was a mess and totally pathetic the whole time so i took really good care of him. he's been taking p good care of me but he's not the same level of caretaker as i am so i'm not getting the same level of pampering. i just wish there was someone here to make me soup and get me ibuprofen and tea every few hours and tell me i'll feel better tomorrow and be able to make it through work. *sigh*.	12
my (f23) ex-boyfriend (m25) is obsessively avoiding me and i don't really know why. so this guy and i broke up 10 months ago and the break up was very, very messy. we still got into fights for months after the break up and hurt each other. so it might be wrong for me to say that i don't know why he doesn't want to see me - i get that, as said, the break up was terrible. what i don't understand is why he seems to be completely obsessed with avoiding me at all costs. he was the one who broke up with me - not because of lack of love but because we were having issues and he couldn't take it anymore. but here's the thing: it was very clear to me and every single person who has ever seen him look at me, that this guy loved me like crazy. for years, i was this guys weakest spot, and thinking back on it, i still don't understand how it couldn't have been like that, it was so obvious that he loved me. but yeah, me and everyone thought he did but then he claimed that it was all completely wrong. four months ago, he literally told me that he never loved me in those 2 years we had been together. that he had fooled himself into thinking he loved me, but (quote) "i was completely wrong, so fuck you, truth hits hard, huh?" he told me that he doesn't care the least bit about me, that his life is immeasurably better without me, that he's very, very happy, happier than he's ever been. he repeated how happy he is like 25 times. and how he thinks of me as this horrible person who has been such a burden to him, which especially shocked me because at that point i realized that he had created his own version of the person i actually am, for whatever reason, maybe it was the only way he could deal with the loss of us, i honestly don't know anymore. he slept with countless girls and threw them at my face, attempted to date some of them seriously (didn't work out, apparently), literally whored his way through the whole city like nobodies business for months and months on end - even though he was never like that before the break up, at least not to that degree. maybe this is tmi (sorry if it is), but he had always loved the sex with me and never been able to enjoy it with anyone else even remotely as much as he had with me (know that for a fact, long story how or why ). but then, after the break up, he told me how he loved his new lifestyle and it made him feel so good and (quote again) "showed me that the sex with you was never as great as i thought, that was just another lie i told myself, there are so much better women for me out there! you were never as great and anyways, i'm having way way more fun now!!!" so, i guess you get how completely bizarre he's been behaving. now, we haven't had any type of contact in a long while. but still, he avoids me like his life depends on it. he doesn't go to any of the events he would usually go to just because there could be the slightest possibility that i could be present. he'll double and triple check with people that i am not going to be there before attending any party. he completely avoids anything to do with me. he has unfollowed almost all mutual friends on instagram because there might be the slightest chance he'll see me in their instagram stories. no one is even allowed to speak my name in his presence, it triggers him. from what i have heard, he never, ever talks to anyone about me, ever. so, you get what i am trying to say - this guy avoids me like the devil avoids holy water. even seeing me at a far distance for 0.3 seconds (which happened once last month) will make him go crazy. it's been a long time since we had any type of real contact. the break up happened so many months ago. i understand why someone would want to avoid his ex, but why does this guy go to such extreme lengths to avoid me if he, as he proclaimed, is happy, doesn't care about me and is living his best life? shouldn't he be giving zero f*cks? why does he go crazy just because he saw me at a distance for a split second? tl;dr: ex boyfriend avoids me like vampires avoid the sunlight. he goes to great lengths to not see me in any type of way, hear of me, hear my name, remember me etc. the break up has happened many months ago and he was not only the one who left me, he also told me afterwards how he had never ever loved me, didn't care in the slightest and is happier than he has ever been. he has been sleeping with countless girls and - to my knowledge - attempted to date some of them seriously. so if he is so okay, why does he still bend over backwards just to avoid me?	9

i (20) was attacked by my boyfriends (24) mum (50) i'm confused and need help i went out with my boyfriends mum and sisters without my boyfriend. everything was fine, but then when i was talking to one of the men with the group about his recent divorce because i do a psychology degree, my bf's mother started getting iffy trying to drag me away, after i explained multiple times i was fine and can look after myself, she turned and stared. i don't like being told what to do but at the same time definitely not by non family. i got annoyed with the constant coming over and went out for a fag. when i came back in i went over to the mum and said have i upset you or something? and she replied oh you know what you've done talking about psychology crap you don't know people, that psychology crap doesn't matter you're not qualified yet, you're acting like a whore. i then left the bar where she was standing and cried, multiple people came over to me and said if i was ok and she's out of order but i do always blame myself, i then met up with my boyfriend and i was visibly upset. he 'believed me' but today i went on his phone (bad i know but i had a nagging feeling that they were talking about me) and saw that he had been saying to his sister 'she's niave' 'was she on cocaine she's so different on cocaine' which i wasn't i hadn't done any drugs at all yet his sister did. i then also read on his family group chat his mum saying i take him for granted and i don't deserve him and that i can fuck off. i'd like to add i'm a 20 year old who is at uni, lives in my own flat without parents, which my 25 year old boyfriend moved into and doesn't pay rent he pays bills. i don't know what to do i'm so angry at my boyfriend but he doesn't think he's betrayed me. i feel so alone because i don't want to tell people to make his family look bad. also it's hindered me seeing a future with him because his family were belittling 'has she got the hump' 'it will blow over' it's really hurt me, apparently the mum does this a lot but it's just like there's no respect. also my boyfriend asking questions about me like that trying to make it my fault not giving me any respect when i was completely in the right even his sister said i wasn't flirting and didn't do anything wrong. how am i supposed to have kids with this guy or get married when his mum acts like that and he belittles me. please give me some advise.	14
hey uh, i have some advice for anybody who gets made fun of for what they like, their appearance or what they believe in i dont know who needs to read this but, never be ashamed for what you beleive it because it makes you well, you. you shouldn't listen to anybody who thinks they can belittle you because of whatever values you hold or your interests since it's none of their business. don't let these people hold you down since they have 0 right to at all. when i was younger i used to be bullied just like just about everybody else but i was particularly sensitive which made it feel worse for me. i still remember when some kid behind a gate at recess called me ugly straight to my face and made me not feel too good. but as i grew up i realized that trying to fit into other people's standards and taking harsh words to heart is a waste of time and prevents me from expressing who i really am and what i'm interested in. high school is a time where you should be you and do what you love. tl;dr just love yourself be proud of your interests for the love of god and don't listen to people who purposely try to hurt you, don't give power to their empty words. keep that chin up	18

does unexpected parental love throw anyone else off? a little context: two days back, i put out a song. a very amateurish song if i'm being honest. so my mom starts spamming every family group with the link today. on one hand it was super embarrassing, but on the other..is she proud?! parental love is so pure man. i can't express with words how much joy i felt. and this was extra special because my parents are usually not that expressive with these sort of things. bonus funny anecdote: so my relatives who are members of said groups say the song is amazing but when i refresh the youtube page the view count is the same as it was before bonus link for those of you that's asking: <url>	1

when i tried to send my ex a picture (nsfw) i still have feelings for my ex, and we have been talking lately about hanging out. we often send funny memes to one another, so i decided to send one i saved months ago. i never delete pix, so i had to scroll through many pix. i found it and i was half paying attention when i clicked and sent it. as soon as i sent it, i screamed internally. i'm a bit of an exhibitionist and i took pix months ago for a guy i was seeing. topless pix with his name written on my chest. that's what i sent my ex. the guy's name is unusual, so panicking i tried to make it sound like i just took the pic and the name was actually just a word in a foreign language. judging by his reaction " " and ensuing silence i don't think it worked. tl;dr accidentally sent ex a topless pic with another guy's name written on me. he was not amused.	7

me [m 28] messing up her [f 34] life by being in love with each other. help... okay, i'm using this platform first time ever to ask something in public - usually i have no problem figuring things out myself. but this is so nerve wrecking, i just don't know how to cope with it. a little background: i (m/28) recently lost a good female friend to suicide, about 3 months ago. since i'm an expat (not living in my home country) i was calling with her at least every three days during the last month of her life, trying to help her with her therapy. she went in for toxication and attempted suicide, made it quite well, until they had thrown her out for...guess what...medicament abuse. shit hit the fan and a kindergarten group found her hanging the next day in a forest, a place where we used to hang out a lot - we knew each other since i was 17, had something going on in between but put it aside since we actually attempted to have serious relationship, but stayed close friends. so you could tell that it hit me of the rail when i heard what happened. i promised to visit her before, already had the tickets, so i met with her family over new year instead. so far, so good. now the main story: while wasting my valuable lifetime on social media, about 6 weeks after she left, i saw the profile of someone (f/36) that reminded me to her. of course, when you loose someone, literally anybody can turn (in your head) into that someone you've just lost, while you are coping with reality. but it wasn't that alone. the more i clicked through her gallery, she reminded me to myself, liking the same pictures, the same way of expressing and so on. usually i'm more introverted and covering my anxiety with expressing myself, so i would never show someone that i actually give a fuck about them or their pictures, even if i can relate. but under these circumstances i couldn't resist the urge and commented it on a philosophic level...and got her appropriate reply. i started digging into it, just for the sake of it and we went from commenting on each other to writing directly. of course, i took it a step further and said that we should meet up while i'm in my home country. that's where it really went south. she told me that she just got married, two weeks ago. for plain social security reasons and that's bespoken between her and her husband - he's actually a friend and she didn't sleep with someone the last six years, they don't even share the bedroom. when doing this, she simply had cost/efficiency in her mind, already giving up on her hopes and dreams...and guess what, i could relate. we did not meet while i was there, but did not stop texting either, actually it just got more and more intense. back home to where i live, two weeks ago, she got a mental breakdown, 4 in the morning, after i asked her if she's happy with her actual situation. we stopped texting a half hour ago and then my phone just went ding... ding... dinding..ding for 15 minutes. it was (of course) her, texting me that we should stop this, she's endangering her marriage and everything. i should not ever have contact her again...i had nothing to reply but my acceptance. the next morning i was in a hurry, hitting the bus...but when i sat down, watching the landscape passing by i started crying harder than i did, when i lost my friend. i did not expect this. being usually self aware af, these feelings hit me like a 40 ton truck and rolled me over like a crippled dear on the left lane of a german autobahn. when i reached my destination, i realized that my (usually plain) emotional life was out of order. and that i forgot my luggage in the bus. i sat down and started writing a song about this, about everything i felt at this moment and ended up writing three of them. i made six tries to record one on my phone and sent it to her. this time we got our mental breakdown together, that was like ten days ago. since then we keep texting every day, started even calling and just yesterday we've spent until 5 in the morning, skyping with each other. even right now she's texting me and i feel my heart going giggedi. we have an incredible bunch of similarities, in arts, in music, lifetime goals (until she got married) and i can clearly tell that she is the one i was god asking for and she feels absolutely the same. but now, realistically and all this candy sweet shit aside: - she is just married - my beliefs don't comply with this situation, hers neither - we are 2000km away from each other - even if we want to, i can barely afford living on my own - (...) we never used the magic three words, but i can tell you right now, driven by hormones, that i clearly love her, have aeroplanes in my stomach and she feels the same. example? i told her that, if we should ever meet, i want to draw her face because she is that beautiful. she replied with a pencil scetch of my face she made yesterday. and there are a million other little things. i just don't know how to deal with it. tl;dr i think i found the love of my life. sketchy point is that she got married, 2 months ago.	11

i (38f)keep trying to get my abusive ex (38m)out of my mind but it isn't working hey guys. i was in a ldr for a year and half and while it started off good, i started noticing red flags. flags like being mean to me for no reason, trying to isolate me, a persistence to combine finances even though he had massive debt with his ex (his child's mother). because i am submissive and like unusual things (for example i love sex dolls ) he began to be more forceful with requests, like threesomes or being polyamorous. i wasn't interested and he backed off, but it created a lot of anxiety for me because even exploring sex dolls with him was something i was never able to do with anyone. in other words, like why couldn't he just be happy with me? he was so insecurebut i loved him and never cheated. the distance didn't matter. one day he started calling me names and bringing up my past so i broke it off. and this is where the shit show starts. he began to stalk me on social media but i didn't care but he wasn't reaching out- it was like passive stalking. but then i reached out 3 months later because i was thinking about him (big mistake)and he just became so cruel. he starting posting himself with a girl in his ig highlights and recycled our memories with her. he posted an insane amount of ig stories, and it seemed desperate, so i stopped watching. i never blocked though. fuck him we don't follow each other and i thought i could be mature enough to not stalk his ig. he continued to like/ post comments on my ig, while seemingly with his new woman. when the ex and i were together, i talked about moving to hawaii.(he lives there) i put so much effort into it looking for a job, pricing, and saving money. i went there in may to see if i still wanted to move there even though the ex and i are not together. i even reached out to him and offered to support him at his graduation, because i was proud of him. even though he was being cruel, i just thought it was because i hurt him by breaking it off. i wanted to make things right. he told me he didn't have enough tickets for the graduation so i backed off. being in hawaii was great! and while the ex stalked me online while i was out there, he didn't reach out and neither did i. so i felt really good and thought we were both moving on. i did peek at his page and saw the woman at his graduation. i was sad, but it is what it is. the day i left hawaii, a user on youtube started contacting me and leaving posts. these posts were super detailed, talking about he still loved me and wanted to be with me. the details were things only my ex would know. he didn't reach out while i was in hawaii (not even on some friend shit) and is now poorly attempting to stalk me on youtube? i played along until last week and it got intense so i pulled back. this story is so crazy...his mom still follows me and i saw her on my timeline. my ex still appeared to be with the same woman! ugh, what scum. i actually felt like he wanted to be with me! i feel so stupid. i don't know what i thought, some "you got mail" shit i guess. the point is, i still have feelings for him. it's hard for me to admit it. i haven't even been with anyone since we broke up. i've read self help books and even joined a damn support group! this is a bad show that no one is watching. two people obsessed with each other. i just want to stop. tl;dr: after breaking up with ex and dealing with his cruel games to show how happy he is, he still is stalking me non stop and even created a fake profile to contact me. i looked within and realized i still love him. please help me help myself.	11
healthy relationships are the bi-product of loving yourself first. i've (24f) been in an incredible relationship with my fiance (26m) for three years and i couldn't be more blessed or grateful for where we are today. i found what i've typed below true for me and hope it helps you as well. relationships aren't as hard as people today make them out to be. i see posts all day long similar to "my bf does this, should i be with him?" or "my gf doesn't let me do ____, should i leave her?" the simple answer to all of these is: if this person makes you genuinely happy and makes an effort to put you first in his or her life, they're a keeper. they should want to put you first and do so without effort - you shouldn't be having to tell them to put you first, respect you, etc. if this person only makes you happy because you don't want want to be single, this is not a good reason to stay with this person. it's only delaying you finding a good person to be with because you likely won't find one while you're in your current relationship. tl;dr: sometimes we over-complicate these things when it's really not that hard. find someone that loves you for you and stop trying to be someone you're not - you have to love yourself first! take time and work on loving you.	3
locking myself into a phone contract and not getting the one feature i wanted - it was the next model up. i'm feeling so stupid and sad. sad because i've wanted a new iphone for ages and had the iphone 5 for years. i just became a new mum and wanted a phone that could take really great photos. a few family members and friends started taking "portrait" mode photos of my daughter and they looked amazing. when i asked what phone they all told me iphone 8. then husband surprised me and told me to go get the phone i wanted out of the blue. we are trying to save so i never thought i would get what i wanted. went down asked for an iphone 8 spent 3 hours talking plans (have a business plan and was seeing if i could get a better deal since i'm there - then was asking if i bundle could husband also get a new phone as his was also outdated) finally got the phone took ages to download itunes and restore and backup and went to take my first photo on new phone of my daughter and it didn't have the setting. my heart sunk. i knew straight away it wasn't what i actually wanted. i was so focused on trying to save money to help us out and help my husband potentially get a new phone as well that i forgot about the feature i really wanted. meanwhile my husband is really excited with his new phone! stupid mentally tired new mum brain. tl;dr forgot to actually ask if he iphone 8 has the feature i wanted as i took the word of family and friends for those who are wondering the iphone 8 plus has portrait mode. not iphone 8.	4

i (f/34) need a cold slap to wake up from my dead end relationship tl;dr i'm in a dead end relationship. my inner voice keeps screaming at me to get out. however, i didn't listen and keep holding on. i'm angry at myself for letting thing going the way it was. i need a cold and hard slap to wake up! i was 30. have a full time job. went to school full time. had a mortgage. i have been with him for almost 4 years. when we first started dating, i told him that i want a long term relationship that results in marriage. he said that's exactly what he wants. things went really well. he is perfect. he is ambitious, smart with money, kind, caring, affectionate, doesn't smoke, is not a party animal, etc. i'm super grateful that he comes to my life. i love him to bits. things started to get shaky in year 2 when i brought up the marriage topic. i had a mortgage. he said that he didn't want to settle down with someone in debt. i offered to sign a prenup, therefore, he had nothing to worry about my liability. he said no. as long as i'm still in debt, he can't settle down with me. to fix the problem, i asked my brother to take over my mortgage in exchange for the house. i walked out empty handed (first hoop that i jumped) without any debt, i wishfully brought up the marriage again. he said i had not finished my degree. he preferred that i finished my degree before getting marriage. it was for my own good. i agreed. (second hoop that i jumped) i finished my degree (with a magna cum laude, i must brag ). i wishfully brought up the marriage again. he said that he needed to get a better job first. the one he had at the moment was not what he wanted. i waited. then he got his dream job at his dream company and everything was good for him. i happily asked him to marry me. (i sound like a broken record and i'm not proud). he answered with the most iconic phrase : i'm not ready! you all would think i would cut loses and move on, right? no! i stayed. i thought if i stay, he will be ready eventually. yesterday, i mentioned about move in together. he said no. he prefers to live separate and keeps thing the way it is. after almost 4 years, this is the result i get. i don't blame him. it's my fault. i know what kind of relationship i get myself into but refuse to do anything about it. i have zero integrity and i'm ashamed of that. so redditors, i turn to you in hope that you can talk some senses out of me. i'm hopeless.	6

i'm a lesbian homewrecker so im a college student and i live on campus. a little while ago i got myself into a huge mess. girl a and girl b we're dating for awhile and things were getting really tense. constant fighting and arguing about the past and present bs. i was and i guess still am friends with girl a but at the time we weren't super close. i invited girl a out one night with my friends because she looked like she needed some space away from school. after getting back to our dorm we were drinking and having fun and girl a kept talking about wanting to fuck me and spend the night in my room. i thought this was a big joke i didn't know she was serious but this girl is hot so i was kind happy she seemed interested. ive never been with a girl before but i've likes them for sure so this was exciting for me. the night went on and she went back to her room and was messaging me about how bad she wanted to kiss me. she ended up coming back to my room and we made out and she was gonna spend the night but knew it'd be wrong. she cheated. but broke up with girl b a few days later. the next two weeks we spend having the best time together regardless of her crazy ex who'd nonstop text and argue with girl a. but she didn't seem to care because we were happy. now months later they're on and off constantly and it's really fucking me up in my head. girl b hates me so much and as much as i may have hurt her feelings she doesn't know anything she just assumes everything about me and that makes me feel like shit because i'm not a home wrecker. that house was already broken but for some reason they're both so addicted to the toxic relationship and i can't get girl a to believe she deserves better. we used to talk everyday and she's call me late at night to hang out or ft me while she drives home just to see me but now i barely heat or see from her and i think her and girl b are back together because she posted about her today and she was in a bikini . also girl b lives with girl a because pretty much she can't live at home so they're constantly with each other and i never get and time with girl a. i don't wanna be jealous or petty but i've been so mature about all of this. never getting mad or starting a fight but i've had enough because no one is fair to me. my friends think i should move on. and i know i should but she's so different and deserves so much more and i feel incomplete knowing she's living this life with less then what she deserves. i'm just really stuck. everytime they break up i have hope but it's false hope i'm just stupid and want things to go my way but i don't think that'll ever happen	11

my mom started her first degree in 25 years, what should i get her for christmas? me, my dad and the older of my brothers all have degrees. my dad has 2 bachelors and a master by himself. my mom didn't finish her degree because she got pregnant with me and decided to stay home. this past fall she started a business degree! i know she's really nervous about going back to school for the first time in 25 years. we haven't talked much recently (i'm away at school myself) but whenever we do i ask her about her schoolwork and give her encouragement. i'm starting to think about christmas presents and i want to get her something to show i support her but i'm not sure what to get her. the school she and i attend has a swag shop and we went there recently. my dad bought her what she wanted (he's super excited about her going back to school too) and she didn't like what i was thinking about getting her so i'm thinking school swag is out. my mom is a very by-the-book person, a worrywort and kind. i know she'll be ok with anything i give her but i want it to special. i know christmas is a few months away but i need to start thinking now for budget reasons. if anyone has any thoughts i'd love to hear (read?) them!	1

i've been tricking my brother for a week i am scared of the dark, but i can't have a nightlight because it prevents me from sleeping. weird combination, i know. usually my trick is to keep my phone on the brightest setting and then run to my bed, hyperventilating the whole way. my brother and i live together in our 20s because it's easier and we trust each other and because family. we also have 2 cats. for the past week, i've let the kitties sleep on the foot of my bed and then i'll go to my brothers room and tell him, "look! the kitties are being cute!" and he will come and pet them for a bit. once he does this, i'll jump into bed and as soon as he leaves i yell out "could you turn off the light on your way out?" and he does. i hope he doesn't catch on. i am a criminal mastermind	0

sometimes you just need a mental health day i was up all night with really bad anxiety and i woke up this morning feeling even worse. i decided i needed to take a step back from my responsibilities and breathe for a second. at first i felt more anxiety for missing things but then i realized the point was to relax, not to worry. when life gets overwhelming, take a step back and take a day for your mental health.	6
is scratching the "sweet spot" on a dog for too long bad? ok so you know the sweet spot on your dogs back or stomach that if you scratch juuuuuuust right, their leg will shake? yeah? ok because my dog seems to like it when i do that and i wanted to know if someone w the facts could tell me if it's bad to do it for too long or too often. i wouldn't want to hurt my dog but when he gets into it i seem to scratch faster and harder and i don't want to hurt him . so if there is an upper limit to know about that someone could explain to me i would highly appreciate it.	14
pitch perfect is out this weekend and i can't go and watch it. because of this awful cough i've had for two weeks now. i don't want to ruin everyone else's cinema experience with one of my coughing fits. i don't suppose anyone has any old style remedies for chesty coughs? i'm willing to try most things at this point. anything to get rid of the cough headaches/dizziness and get more sleep (as well as watch pitch perfect /mad max!) i'm interested in hearing your old style remedies anyway. my grandma used to always put honey on any bumps and bruises.	15
i am amazingly bad at stuffs but i got used to it. now i am good at being bad at stuffs. so today i had a badminton session with my friends and after a game one of my friend said "how can you be so bad at stuffs that you have been doing for years", and i am reminded how bad i am, again. be it sports, gaming, socializing, career, making decisions, driving, keeping body shape, i am always not as good as my friends. i've played an online game for over 900 hours but my rank is still lower than my friends. i played football almost weekly during my school years but i still can't make a good pass or shoot the ball well. my friends all have better income job compared to me. my friends had success in getting girlfriends but i am still single. for years. well, i've come to accept not everyone is good at life. i am one of them	9

some people are acting like pets are a right and it deeply upsets me i was having a good day and just scrolling tiktok then there's this one of a guy who's cats in heat and he's trying to stop them from mating? ##that should never be an issue with your pets like what if you have cats they should be spayed or neutered. people in the comments are pointing this out and everyone's just like "okay you pay for it " like no?? #if you can't afford to get a cat spayed or neutered don't get it?? there are so many cats in the world already who need homes and we don't need more people breeding cats especially when they have no background on their families. same thing applies to dogs. absolutely fuck adults who have un spayed and neutered dogs. i work and manage to pay my pets vet bills. i'm aware not everyone has the money but like don't get the pet if you can't afford it?? obviously lower income people deserve nice things but that isn't just about them it's about the pet. it's just so stupid.	3

offering a man with one arm "a hand" so this happened last year when i was backpacking solo thru london. it was around 11:00pm and i was getting off a late flight and trying to find my hostel on some streets i've never been on before. i really had no clue where i was other than my google maps on my phone showing me where to walk from the tube to my hostel. as i was walking i came across a homeless man who was sitting on the street trying to open a bottle of ginger ale. he was having difficulty opening it because he only had one working arm and a stump near his elbow on his other arm. he was holding the bottle between his legs and trying to open it with his good hand but it was on pretty tight so when he turned it, it was turning in his legs. i, a good canadian boy, saw this man in distress and like the good person my dad raised me to be i offered to help him. it happened so fast and i didn't even think about it, so i walked up to him and blurted out "hey do you need a hand?" i immediately realized what i just said to this poor man and felt terrible because that's not what i meant. he heard me. he let me open his bottle and he guzzled it away. he yelled something incoherent at me and stammered away. i think he was semi appreciative but still insulted. i immediately felt terrible for saying what i said but i honestly tried to do a good deed and today i just messed it right up. frick. tl;dr i helped a one armed man open a soda bottle but first asked if he needed a hand.	7

second date for v day i really hit it off with someone on the first date. we were originally going to meet this weekend but work has got them swamped, so i suggested valentines day (i'm a madman, i know!) she's down for it and it's all going ahead. just needed some advice on some things: 1. i got her a card and chocolates. is this ok and not too much? 2. current itinerary is mini golf, drinks then dinner. i'm trying to keep it fun as well as romantic. again, hope this is pretty chill? thought going to the movies was bland and i wanted to make it special for her. tl;dr going on a second date and wanted some thoughts on what i'm doing on the night	6

i've accepted that i'm a good person, normal, and pretty the first thing my therapist ever did for me was tell me to come up with three good things about myself and three thinks that made me happy. the task seemed impossible - i felt worthless and hollow. fast forward six years and i'm getting married to the most intelligent and nurturing woman i have ever known. i get told i'm gorgeous and i make side money by modeling. i have a new well-paying job i'm very good at that helps people and involves playing with dogs. i love my high cheekbones and my fluffy hair and the gap in my smile. writing, archery, and anything pastel makes me happy. i genuinely want to keep living. after what i went through there didn't seem to be anything left but with perseverance, professional psychiatric and medical help, and the support of my fiancee and her family. i'm become a whole woman like i've never been before. i'm so happy that i picked such a dull knife when i was fifteen and got to live to see these days of light and freedom. that's all.	3
i just had a mental breakdown i was just on youtube and saw "4 years ago" and thought haha oh look at this old school youtube video probably from 2008 i clicked on it and it said 2015... what the actual fuck. how was 2015 4 years ago? 4 years used to seem like such along time but why does it feel like 2015 was yesterday. it still hasn't clicked in my brain when i see anything over 4 years ago on youtube that it isn't from the 2000s. i'm so old and wasting my life	2
i need your opinion and help hey guys so i am a female 21 years old and i am currently in a long distance relationship with my bf (29 yo). we only see each other once a month or once in 2 months for 3-5 days. we have been dating for a year so, we have been arguing a lot lately because he said i always want to talk to him and he wants a space. i work evening to night (til 10 pm) and he works 9-5 monday to friday. so our schedule is kinda different. we used to talk almost everyday (video chat) and we compromised and cut down to 3/4 times a week because i want to give him what he asked for -- space. he loves watching movies and he always put his fitness first. he sometimes ignored me and did not engage in a conversation when i am trying to make a conversation between us. he previously said that i am a bad communicator and the fact is i always tried to talk to him and he just answered me with 2 words answer and did not reply to my questions. when i gave him plenty of space, he told me he misses me and wanted to talk to me more yet (sometimes) ignore me. i feel like he changed his mind as fast as the wind and i am not sure how to make both of us happy. how should i do to deal with this and to be a better girlfriend? thank you	4

nobody i surround myself with has common interests with me and i don't know where to make friends that i can relate to. when i'm not working or going to school i hit the gym, meal prep and making high protein cake and other sweets and then sometimes stay at my boyfriends place and watch tv. possibly it's because i'm such a health nut and gym rat that i feel this way but nobody i work with eats healthy and their version of getting shape is working out and getting mcdonalds after. it's not like i care but i have nobody to really feel connected with at my job on a friend level. i only have one friend at the gym that has the same passion in nutrition and fitness as me but most guys at the gym aren't looking to just "be friends" with a girl and if they are talking to me it's just to get in my pants :/ even my boyfriend doesn't care about nutrition like i do. he eats whatever and finds it annoying when i tell him anything that can improve his bulking with macro counting etc. i'm going to school for nutrition, it's my passion but i just have nobody i can really talk to and connect with. maybe i'm just stressing myself out over how other people eat but i just feel really alone. i don't know how to make friends with my passion for fitness and nutrition and starting to think i have problems for wanting other people to eat healthy as well if anyone has a passion for nutrition and fitness and wants to chat im more then happy to	2
important question!! are you guys okay? because im not	3
i (22m) dont know what to do with my new gf (21f)? hey guys im new to reddit and kindda happy to be in this community! you know, recently i got into a relationship with my co-worker ,about 1 month ago. she came to our department about 4 or 5 month ago and she used to work with us in a same room,we used to talk normal on daily basis at the start,i mean there was no emotion included. after 1 or 2 month from the start ,one of my male co workers - who was her friend and introduced her to our department for work - came to me and told me that she is intersted in you ,so go and follow her on instagram if you like her too, he kindda wanted to force me to do that but i refused ,but two days later i followed her. we started to meet casually about one month, once a week for e.g ,but i didnt feel so much sexual attraction and desire for her at that time,but i ignored that,so after one month we went for hollidays and started to chat more intense,after 1 week of intesive chatting she finally told me : we both know we like each other so if you want to think about the future and having a relationship ,lets be with each other,i answered :yes, but i just want to know you more and it doesnt guarrantee that we will get married (because her final target is getting married with me and i knew that at the very first point).so we started to know each other through texting in hollidays and after 2weeks we got back to the same city and went to department for starting work again,we hangout at that day and she kissed my chick and i gave her our first kiss but it didnt feel that much,totally normal, so by the way days passed and we hangout on most days in week. she was so hotter and more into me,that it made her to be starter of kissing and making love with each other ,but i never feeled that much with her. so after 2 weeks of dating she started to talk about marriage and something like that - not in a direct way - by joking about it, but i knew what she meant. she started to tell me if you leave me i dont know what will happen to me and something like that,calling me 3 times a day ,sending me love messages and ... after third week we fell apart because i was too busy ,and she started to call me and nagging me about why we cant go out,i missed you and ... but suddenly i came to myself and found out that i dont think about this girl through the day,i dont have much desire to call her,i dont know if i really want her, i dont feel honeymoon phase ,and i dont know if im really in love with her. since she is too sensitve and madly in love by three weeks ,i ve got scared a little bit and told her today i want to have time and think about our relationship, so now ,i want to know should i continue and discover her more and i would finally fall in love or should i break up since she is too sensitive and her main reason for relationship is getting married! (she is marriage type) i really dont want to hurt her but from other side i dont know if she is the one and i dont know if i want to get married with her,she fell too early in love,but i think if i break up with her i would never find a girl who will love me back like her,but i hate some of her behaviours too, i never missed her in 2 weeks that we were apart ,sometimes i think im gay because i lost my affection and emotion for this girl too early,i dont even have desire to have sex with her!! what shall i do? thanks for making time and reading this. tl;dr: im in one month relationship with my co worker but i dont know if im really in love,i dont feel attraction enough and since she wants to get married and wants to secure relationship for that,i dont know should i break it off or stay and continue?but from other hand i get afraid of not finding a girl that loves me back like that in future!	1

i (27f) can't stand my bf's (27m) sil(26) throw away account, first post. sorry this post is long and if it's weirdly formatted. _________________________________________________________ my boyfriend(bf) is very close with his family and when i first started dating him, almost all of them were living in the same house so i got to meet them all fairly quickly. i got along well with everyone except his sister in law. _________________________________________________________ some backstory. bf's older brother(ob) dated this woman for a month before she ended up pregnant. she had a ton of debt and a really bad credit score, so ob ended up taking a job overseas to pay off their combined debt. before he left she pressured him into getting married because she wanted the last name. he gets back, they're finally debt free, but struggles with the pay difference in jobs and they're scrape by. she decides that they have to get pregnant again at this very moment because she wants her kids close in age. my bf tells him to seriously consider holding off because they just got rid of their debt and are struggling to keep above 0 right now. they get pregnant again and have two kids they can't really afford. _________________________________________________________ sil has a history of screaming at people, her kid, her baby, strangers, animals...no one's safe. it's a very hostile household. i hate being there and i hate even more having to be alone with her. it's so uncomfortable. she will break up conversations that aren't about her and her kids or try to force the topics to change. if she's not fitting into a conversation she will angerly pull her husband away with some excuse to help her with something (kids, chore, something in the bedroom etc). she will condescendingly talk down to anyone (even her fil) about almost anything they're not perfect with. she also brags to anyone who will listen about how she does everything by herself when her fil, who's retired, watches the kids for them, cleans the kitchen, living room, does dishes, laundry and grocery shopping. bf moved in with me to try and get away from all the crazy. we have also caught her asking for money to take care of things (they used to have a family phone plan), but asking for around twice the amount and conveniently coming home with her nails done. (we found the receipts on their table and he has his own phone plan now) and they're back in debt after their second child was born. __________________________________________________________ no one in my boyfriend's family likes her except his older brother. to top all of this off, her fil left for a trip mid december and then she cheated on her husband over new year's right before fil came home. lied about going out with a friend for drinks, and actually went with this guy. then lied about going to said friend's house and actually went home with this guy. then put her phone on silent for the rest of the night and came home at 11am. she sat down her husband, complained about all of the things he did wrong in their relationship and ends with "but that doesn't excuse me cheating on you last night." tells him that she had sex with this guy, and doesn't know if she wants to stay married or break it off for this new guy. three days later, she says she's going into work on her day off to try and get extra money working overtime. mutes her phone. comes home late and tells her husband she slept with the new guy again. this whole time, ob is breaking down crying/having anxiety attacks, telling bf and i he doesn't know what to do, or how to be ok around their two children. she claims that the relationship she started with the other guy just kind of happened suddenly, but we found instagram posts with notes she wrote saying things like "i love you! " up to two months before everything happened. ob ends up convincing her to do counciling with her after talking about splitting up their finances. she claims to break all contact with the other guy but then goes to see him one last time, when she told her husband she was running to grab food. there isn't a full "i cut him off and blocked him, here check my phone" until a week later. now, they've been doing counseling for about 3 weeks and focusing on their relationship. they want to act like a happy family all over again and pretend like she never cheated. they never told ob and bf's mother, because she would have gotten super upset. ob has begged us not to tell her. i now not only don't like bfs sil, don't trust her, but also don't want to deal with her. i told bf before we moved that she's not allowed or i won't live with him. he agreed and also doesn't want her here but now that they're pushing it, he doesn't want to say no and upset his brother. since we just moved, we got new appliances, and she was overly excited to see them. then told us we have to thow a party and invite everyone. i feel now like she's trying to make the story out to be "op is stopping my husband from being with his brother!!" when i actually encourage bf to go visit his father/brother/nieces whenever he has time. he doesn't want to be around this woman either and avoids it at almost all costs. how do i navigate this situation? i genuinely feel uncomfortable around her and don't trust her at all. tl;dr bf's sil is hateful, cheated on bf's brother and now they want to act like nothing happened and be a big happy family, but i want nothing to do with her.	3
90s tv humor & how it shaped us i was watching an old sesame street episode with my niece that my mom had pulled out of storage. it was vhs and from the 1990's. i noticed the way the characters interacted was a little different...they took their time talking to each other. these days it seems like the characters barely take a breath in between sentences. i wondered if that was before instant gratification made us all zippy and quick to move on to the next thing. i also noticed the humor seemed different..almost like it was focusing on the lack of intelligence or skill of a character. i recall there being a lot of slow or dumbed down characters in 90s shows. i think they changed that after realizing it was offensive. or am i imagining all this? would love some feedback, maybe some more examples or evidence? i'm starting to think this "odd one out" humor made me more self conscious growing up. typical millennial looking for something to blame for my personality defects	9

tifu, by letting a shady 711 clerk sell me a losing scratcher... i know it's stupid and essentially a huge waste of money but every week when i get paid i always pick up a couple scratchers. i usually go to the 711 down the street, and i have never one more than 5$ or a free ticket (been buying regularly for almost two years) ... so today i go in and as i'm checking out i ask for my usual 2 games. the clerk is a different guy, i'd never really seen him before and he starts telling me to buy this 5$ bingo game. i said no thanks, i'm pretty sure that game is ending soon and the odds are considerably less. he then tells me, no, it's a "brand new game" (obviously lying) then says something like "why not" and scans the ticket anyway! then i tell the guy, no man, i don't want that ticket...he said "once you tear them off, they're lucky"...i realize this doesn't even make sense...i look at him, puzzled, and he just finishes ringing me up. i let this pushy asshole sell me this ticket i explicitly told him i didn't want, and the worst part is, as i'm walking out i look at the ticket and it's all scuffed up with weird little scratches, as if the tickets were already scanned for winners and the losers had been marked in a way that seemed innocent...idk, maybe i'm over-thinking this but i took pictures and haven't scratched it yet. i'm pretty sure it's a dud and my local 711 is scamming its scratcher customers. edit: okay, now i really fucked up because after filing an offocial complaint and all that balogne i go to actually play the motherlovin thing and it turns out it's a winner and it was worth a whole 20 shekels so go figure. sometimes you gotta laugh at yourself, and sometimes you gotta admit you have a huge gambling problem on the rise... thanks for the sympathetic advice, /r/ i really am a dummy sometimes	9

is she out of my league? i've been dating a girl for almost 2 months now. i matched her the very day i installed tinder. took a while to get a date but i got it, went on a few dates. i like her quite a bit and she's really pretty. i'm not very attractive haha so i'm always a bit slightly concerned that i'm not good enough. but she keeps seeing me, keeps spending the night i asked my friends if they think she's out of my league today. they said no! she's like exactly the person i can imagine you saying. that made me feel so good! she's so gorgeous!	17
do you consider this rude? i have this coworker. she is constantly commenting on my weight. i am 5'4 and i weigh 110. yes, i am thin but i am not emaciated. for context, she is slightly taller than me and weighs probably around 100 pounds more. i have never commented on her or anyone else's weight- i find that topic very personal and none of my business. i have struggled in the past with some eating disorders but i am managing that aspect of my life very well and i eat regular meals, though i do eat less than many people. i don't like the feeling of being too full and "stuffed", it makes me feel uncomfortable. long story short, she is always making (what i consider) very rude comments about my weight!! at our work christmas party, we did a dirty santa game and i got a chick fil a gift card. she said, "oh you better trade that, do you even eat?" i was like umm...yes i eat. but looking back i wish i had said something more along the lines of, no i am a unique breed who can subsist on only air and water then recently we all went out to work after some meetings and i ate my plate of food along with some ice cream for dessert. she said, "you mean you actually ate that? i am surprised." maybe i am being sensitive but i really don't understand why she has to comment on what i may or may not eat every time any subject about food, and myself, are in a room together. sorry to complain everyone. just getting that out of my system.	11
i passed my driving test today it was my first attempt too! i also made friends with the driving instructor who was testing me, and we exchanged numbers. we had a pleasant conversation about learning languages and i could see him slowly turning from a stone cold dmv employee into a real human being; he started getting more engaged in our conversation and smiled more! it warmed my heart. i am pretty happy right now!	6

humans are strictly herbivores? hmmm i'm reading about what makes humans herbivores and it's not sitting 100% with me. the points they make are -we have long intestines for digesting plant foods. -our hands are much better suited for grabbing fruit and climbing trees. -our canine teeth are much much smaller then a carnivores. ect ect. i'll skip the long post about it all. but what doesn't sit right with me yet is the idea that australian natives are herbivores. i mean, you don't simply walk around the australian outback/coast and find a banana tree with a godly light shining down onto it signifying by devine providence that you may eat them. you don't find potato's, bananas, apples or any other fruit in australia that i know of. what they had to eat was fish, lizards and kangaroos ect. so by saying that we as humans evolved as herbivores.... where do australian aboriginals for into that? as there are definetly no plants for them to have eaten. or perhaps i'm not thinking back far enough, perhaps when they say we are herbivores they are talking about when the continents were one whole. and then it split and we started eating meat. any ideas? where do australian natives fit into the whole herbivore timeline?	10

a trouble maker story so i had art today in school and we were being loud and our classroom is right next to the students who need help with school classrooms. well one of the teachers came out and yelled at us and i whispered yah dan ( his name isn't dan but for privacy) she saw me and i had to sit in her classroom for ten minutes and have her yell at me and i must have not done a good job because at the end of her rant she was like uh you don't even care just leave and i geuss everyone could hear her yelling at me. just a story in the life of a school kid	19
ps vita analog stick problem hey guys, i am having some issues with my ps vita right analog stick, when i play attack on titan 2 or resistance burning skies for example it works properly, but when i switch to call of duty declassified or freedom wars the analog is sticking to the down-left side, i can't play like that of course especially in an fps games.. so i think the problem is from the system and not from the analog itself cuz it didn't get effected by dust or anything. also i did try to re-downloading the games but it's still not working! please if you know a good solution for this bug just tell me cuz this is going to make me mad	19

story times about my workplace now that i've quit on my last day, some dude came in and he was talking about how he worked in the car shop behind us and i couldn't even pretend to be interested. then he said "at least you're fortunate to have a job haha" and i was just in my head like "i'm not gonna be grateful for some dumbfuck job that capitalism forces me to have just so i can survive but sure sir". needless to say, i ignored the girl instinct to laugh at whatever a guy says and just said "yeahhh". then some lady also got mad at me because i took her order wrong when i told her the total even though her english was high key terrible and god damnit the numbers on menus exist for a reason lady. after several back and forth, i finally try to be the voice of comprehension and read the order back to her as if i'm talking to a child. turned out she wanted a whole meal not individual items, my bad maam my mind reader skills are a bit rusty . so then i was like "oh my bad, it was my fault sorry sorry, what did you want" but nooo this bitch wanted to keep muttering about how she's not coming back here . then i'm just trying to steer it back to okay we get it, i took your order wrong what did you want now but then she begins raising her voice at me and then now my supervisor has to intervene. well my supervisor gives even less shits than me so she takes the lady's order tells her the total, lady's like wtf it's supposed to cost less starts raising her voice , (btw it was the right price since the cut of meat she wanted was bigger) and that's when my supervisor hit her with the "ma'am don't raise your voice at us etc etc" and this lady finally carries out what she's been muttering about the whole time and leaves thank you. i'm just regretful i didn't tell her to gtfo first also for the most part im pretty nice at work but i wasn't having it this day yup	18

my son came out as bi and i'm so proud of him. edit at the bottom my son is in his early teens and his "mother" and are thankful not together anymore. so how it happened was she texted me the other night saying he came out and wanted to know how i would feel about it. i told her i couldn't care less if he was straight, bi or gay. i love him no matter what. last night my fiance went and picked him him up and we sat down and had dinner like nothing happened. after we ate she went upstairs and i asked him if there was anything he wanted to tell me. he knew that i knew and said that he was bi. and then proceed to say his mother said that i would be disappointed and work him out to get the gay out. i lost my shit. i grabbed him and hugged him, telling him that i love him and this has no effect on how i view him. i told him i was proud of him and that we are here for him no matter what. then he told me that his mother gave him two choices, home school which would require him in his free time to read the bible, pray and go to church everyday to get the gay out. or go back to public school and be bullied every day again. i gave him a third choice, i'm filling for custody and bringing him with me where he can be who he is. loved and not judged. now begins our journey of getting him into a better home. edit. mod removed because i didn't replay. i was spending time with my son...so that's fine and thank you to everyone for your support. it means a lot to us	8
today i read about my brother's suicide this is the first time i read about my brother's suicide. he was in jail for a year, waiting on trial in a high profile case, which is why there are articles of him out there. he gave up. no one believed he was innocent, even after that was the last thing he wrote in his suicide letter. he asked for help for 6 months, but they ignored him. there was his death, black on white. a description of how he hung himself and that it took them over an hour to find him in his cell. he was alone, in a place that became his hell on earth. since then, so much have happened in my life that i wish he could see. i met the most amazing man, i finished my ap degree, lived and worked in two countries, traveled, laughed, experienced so much. it hurts me that he will never see me get married, have children, live my life. everyday i try to live by his last words to me "live your live, keep exploring, and keep on smiling". i really do try. but today, even after 9 years, it hits me like a wave. he was the one that kept our family together. now we're a glass ball, glued together with a piece missing, more fragile than ever and with the cracks still so visible. i miss him everyday. nothing will be like it used to be, that much is clear after so many years. but for you bro, i will keep on exploring and smiling. thanks for all the laughs, smiles, bad jokes and thank you for loving me.	3

does anyone want to share their positive and happy stories with me? i work nights, and the environment at night lately has been quite negative. someone hates someone. someone wronged someone. all that silly, petty stuff. i've been working extremely hard to focus more on happy thoughts rather than negative thoughts for the new year, but it's definitely more challenging when i get to work because everyone is ready to complain about something. well my birthday is tomorrow, and i thought it'd be nice to read some happy/positive/uplifting stories for a change. i'm so used to everyone, especially my coworkers, venting to me and all i want right now is to start my birthday at midnight on a happy note. what is your favorite memory? what makes you smile? what is the nicest thing someone has done for you? what makes you so happy that you could cry? have you ever had a meal or a snack that just made you feel so content or made you do a happy dance? is there a song that gives you goosebumps of satisfaction? i want to read it all!	19
help! feeling wierd about my gf's guy friend who doesn't really know me and she hides his texts. ok so i'm quite new to posting on reddit. i am a m(30) gf (27) i have seen a couple red flags lately. i'm not sure how to best approach the situation. long story short, she mountain bikes with a few guys in town. i woke up this morning flipped open her computer to start watching the motogp highlights. but the first image on the screen was a text conversation between her and one of the guys she mountain bikes with - "steve" ( my girlfriend links her texts messages to her computer ) i am probably going to get hate for snooping. so i'm going to say who cares and second can we all just agree if a message pops up about your so and a "friend " you're going to read it. the text read as follows and the time is important because i find it strange to make plans to meet up with someone late at night that's not your bf. 9:45pm her: i'm going to go to a friends right now for a little bit for a fire. not sure how long i will be. steve: okie dokie i'm in the area too. sick have a good time . let me know if you want to meet up after 11:45 pm her: hey i'm just leaving now i think i am going to head home haha i didn't realise how late it was steve: haha ya i just got out of the shower and i'm.... that was all i saw . i did not want to scroll and snoop her messages. so i started watching the motogp highlights and a message alert came in this morning from steve saying good morning and asking how game of thrones was last night now i totally understand that there isn't much to read into here. however i have been noticing that he has been texting her quite a lot over the past 3ish days . and she seems to be tilting her phone from me or quickly erasing or minimizing the messages if i walk by. she has never really mentioned him to me before and i don't believe he knows about me. (he could but i doubt it) i am just getting a strange feeling in my gut about this guy and her. i trust nothing will happen, but it seems he is interested in her and she isn't really putting up the sorry i'm not available vibe. i also think it's weird to just meet up with a guy friend that isn't a super good friend late at night for no reason. or make plans too. tl;dr! i don't know if i am over thinking my gf's behaviour over text with other guys... and it's definetly not flirty. just seems off. thanks	6
comment on "forced diversity" in a hate sub? what could go wrong? an organization has 20 open internal positions. there are 200 applicants: 50 women, 150 men. if the company just takes the top 10% in an unbiased manner, all else being equal, you would expect the 20 positions to be filled by 5 women and 15 men, exactly representative of the applicant pool. suppose instead the company decides tge putcome should be 50:50 and fills the 20 open positions with the top ten men and the top ten women. the men are the top 7%. the women are the top 20%. to someone looking at this result, there are 2-3 women who seem able to hold their own when compared to the men. they can think of a few dozen men who applied who seem better qualified than at least half of the women who were promoted. the promoted women, otoh, feel like they need to work at least twice as hard as their male peers to produce the same level of work. they feel like their work is subject to more criticism and scrutiny than their male counterparts. all of these things are true. not because of sexism, but because diversity was forced. though over time, sexist stereotypes may be developed or reinforced as a result. subordinates may assume that female bosses are automatically less competent, simply because that has often proven to be the case due to forced diversity. higher level executives might see female managers as inherently less reliable or more prone to burnout than male managers, but this is not due to gender, but due to forced diversity. **you've been banned from participating in r/feminism**	1
i have intrusive dreams and thoughts about girls that i'm interested in. hello all. i am 19 and currently living in a new city for school. i met this really awesome girl and i think things are going well. neither of us have been in a relationship before so it's been a really comfortable experience so far. ever since highschool, when i began getting serious about approaching girls, i began having these dreams. after a couple weeks of getting to know a girl, i would have a dream about what it would be like to be in a serious relationship with her. i would wake up and the next couple weeks would be filled with anxiety and intrusive thoughts over the girl, almost obsessive. it's this panicking feeling that's the reason why i went through highschool without a girlfriend, never getting second dates because i'm just so flustered all of a sudden. what is this and what can i do about it? it's recently happened to me, yesterday was filled with panic attacks and anxiety over a girl i've been on only two dates with. i can't stop thinking about missing her, and i think it's actually negatively impacting my chances with her as i no longer know what to say in our texting conversations or phone calls and they just end short. sure, it's nice to have somebody to miss, but i don't want to be so worried about it. i really like this girl, i could see us going somewhere, what are some exercises or things i can do to keep my mind off of these feelings? there's really nothing to be panicked about, i honestly don't know where it comes from other than the dream... any advice for keeping a conversation moving would help a lot too i feel like our conversations in person are really great, but i'm just so terrible over text and feel like i have nothing interesting to say. tl;dr: all of a sudden i have anxiety over a girl i like. there's nothing to worry about, but still can't get her off my mind. what can i do?	9

my (26f) bf (38m) of one year wants to visit his ex-wife's new baby, and says that it's something i'll have to live with. tl;dr boyfriend's ex wife had a "miracle" baby with her new bf. he wants us to visit to congratulate them, but says that if we're invited to future birthdays/events for the child, then we will he going. not sure how to handle the emotions. my bfs ex wife (and he) tried for years to get pregnant, and couldn't. about the time my bf and i started dating, the ex wife gets pregnant by her new bf. we have been dating for 1 year now and the baby was just born on mother's day. i've always been insecure about his ex wife bc they grew up together and were married for 12 years, and i'll never be able to give him what she did. she helped raise his 2 kids from a previous marriage and pulled him out of a shitty situation. they're still legally married bf he has her on his insurance, something they agreed to do when they split up 2 years ago. because of this, i feel like he holds her on a pedestal. he's good to me, but i'll never measure up to her. i don't want to go visit, because honestly i don't want this woman in my life. she said something the first time i met her regarding my age, and it bothered me. when i told my bf about it, he acted like i was over reacting and that she would never say something to offend me. i realized that it's always going to be that way. maybe i'm a little jealous of how much he seems to value her. i agreed to go,but asked him how things were going to be in the future as far as the child and his wife being involved in my life. he basically said that if he/we were invited to events that we would be going because of everything his ex wife has done for his kids. i understand that he wants to be friends with his ex wife, but i'm not sure if this is something i can handle in a relationship. everything else is good, she is the only thing that makes me feel insecure. i thought it would change, but it just hasn't. anyone in a similar situation or perhaps from the bf perspective who can maybe help me understand the dynamics and feel a little better about this would be much appreciated.	6

asking who my mom was dating my mom has been acting shady af lately and today we were texting and i unfortunately found out the reason why. she told me that she has been seeing someone which is no big deal being that my parents have been divorced for almost 20 years and neither of them have had relationships since. what was absolutely not okay was the fact that my 61 year old mother informed me that she is dating a 26 year old dwarf who bags groceries at the local grocery store... apparently in addition to bagging my mother. of course, i responded with support for my mother but in the meantime my brain is broken and all i can think is "what in the actual fuck" i'm going to be 33 years old next month and never in my lifetime did i ever think that i would be able to say in full seriouness that my 61 year old mother was dating a 26 year old, dwarf grocery bagger. tl;dr my 61 year old mother is dating a 26 year old, dwarf grocery bagger.	5

go to sleep before you begin to spiral! will delete when i wake up becuase i know i'll regret posting this hehe these days i've been thinking alot about just taking 5 advils and ending it all or at least going into a deep sleep or something. while i know i never will, it makes me sad that it's become such a normal thought in my head whereas like a year ago it wasn't even an option. like rn i just dont like life and ik that sounds cringy but like ... im always injured / in pain (my jaw hurts sm rn i cant even close my mouth my mom said i might need to get surgery if it continues being serious), i used to love school but now the thought of it makes me ancious, im really fat and ugly but im always hungry asf, and im not even rich so i cant buy mateiral possessions to give me momentary happiness! ill never find love or true happiness so my only point of continuing life is on the thin string of hope that i'll be rich in the future and will be able to sleep in a big, comfy bed that smells nice all the time. and i really do think i can do it and i believe that i can be succesful because if i didnt believe in myself i'd be gone by now haha but all seroiusness i hate being a teenager sm because (rn im blaming everything on teenager hormones and my parents genes) teenager hormones are making me so much sadder than i should be and i ahte everyone and everything and no one loves me. my mom doesnt even say she loves me like ma what the hell...? anyways girl btw, this spiral only began because my sister was preventing me from sleeping (it's almost 2 am ) because she was on a call w her friends and being loud asf as if she couldnt call them literally any of the 12 hours of daylight. it really pisses me off and i literally started crying because i couldnt sleep and she was laughing in my face when i told her to get off the call (our rooms r right next to each other and this wall is probably as thick as my wrist). i just want to give her a nice big haircut while she sleeps... choppy bangs r in style rn ! ... and let her suffer. starting to think up a plan... lmao just kidding id feel bad anywayss if u read through this whole thing thank you for letting me release my emotions, i love you, take care of yourself and use me as an example of what not to do, unless you're also currently experiencing stress and emotional breakage from when your friend made you recall your physical and mental abuse which has also added onto this breakdown... and in that case idk what to say... youre not alone... im so hungry i had a korean cheese dog today and it was so good... and now im thinking of curry croquettes... ugh	8

why do parents do this? or is it just mine? i'm suck and tired of my anxiety being confused as bad attitude then getting yelled at for it. like, that doesn't fucking help. i couldn't find a box knife my dad needed so i like started tearing up and freaking out because he always gets mad at me and chews me out when i lose stuff. it causes my anxiety to go through the roof. i try to tell him that's why i'm freaking out and he says that's bullshit. i keep crying and he keeps making me feel worse. it always just ends with me in my bed crying all night. any advice on coping mechanisms to make me feel better? or tips on how to deal with situations like these? thank you reddit fam	3

squeezing my phone this problem actually began about 6 months ago, but i didn't figure it out until this week. my iphone was filling up with diagnostic and usage data. the only way to get it off is to sync it with my computer, and it was even filling my hard drive to capacity! after countless tech support calls, messages, and even a visit to an apple store "genius" bar, the problem had escalated to the point where i was able to send the log data directly to apple engineers. they told me that i was triggering the diagnostic collection manually!? apparently when you press the two volume buttons and the power/lock button at the same time (and the phone responds with a satisfying buzz), diagnostics are collected. i had been doing this absent-mindedly so frequently that it was filling my phone and computer storage. i guess i need a fidget spinner or something. tl;dr for 6 months i was triggering log file collection on my iphone by pressing buttons together which make it buzz, constantly filling my phone storage.	9

way of asking her out? hey, i thought i'd make a post here seeing as i could need some advice. so, there's this girl i met on an "get-to-know" app called bottled about 3 months ago now. i have really grown to love her and i am sure she feels the same way. let me start from the beginning. one day i decided it was time to find someone to talk to seeing as i was curious and i like socializing in that way. so in this app you send bottles out and the person on the receiving end can accept/deny whatever, and so i sent my bottle and it reached this girl. i was immediately pulled in by her profile picture so i decided to talk to her. long story short, we clicked amazingly well and shared similar likings like the songs we liked, which was very new for me seeing as my friends always made fun of my music taste. we continued talking everyday for hours on end, asking each other all the questions we could think off, watched shows and movies together, did quizzes simultaneously, created inside jokes which we still use etc. but we've had some very deep talks aswell and about a month in we told each other we had secrets, which turned into a guessing game for some weeks. we have also said good night in each others languages every night since we met and i can just feel how we are getting closer. anyway we both found out that we shared the same secret, which was that we wanted to meet in eachother in person. and a month after that we had another pair of secrets which turned out to be the same, we said we liked eachother alot which made me very happy to hear. reasons i believe she likes me back: we have been mildly flirting and making these "what if i found a guy/girl" jokes which make eachother jealous(stupid ik). we send eachother pictures of ourselves as well as voice messages pretty often. now we have planned for her to visit me in august for a couple of weeks and i'm really excited. we casually said "i love you" in a playful way at different points in time. we compliment and support each other all the time, she has also started sending the kissing emoji recently when we say good night. etc etc. so now i need advice. how do i ask her out? or do i just let things flow naturally? i know my text is dragged out but i feel like it's needed. and thank you for any suggestions/thoughts. tl;dr - i love the girl i met 3 months ago to bits and i want to ask her out, we are also meeting in august. how should i go about it?	9
my (19m) girlfriends (19f) nan has been diagnosed with dementia, how do i help her? my girlfriend has just told me her nan has been diagnosed with dementia. her nan is 76 years old, and was the one who raised my girlfriend until she was 12, and they've remained extremely close because of this. they'll phone each other pretty much every day, and my girlfriend will go visit her every other day too, and she sees her nan as her true mother. she's absolutely devastated by this news, as am i as her nan is lovely and a truly great person and means a lot to my girlfriend, and i am thankful for her nan for raising such a brilliant girl. another thing to know is that memories mean a lot to my girlfriend, she doesn't like change and she doesn't like getting rid of things that she has an emotional attachment to. she's not too knowledgeable about dementia, but i know a bit about it and know that her nan will start to forget things, and eventually might even forget about my girlfriend, which will absolutely ruin her. so, my question is what do i do to help my girlfriend? this woman is her world, and my girlfriend loves her to pieces, as do i. any help or advice from people who have dealt with family members or friends suffering from dementia will be extremely appreciated, as i really don't know what i can do to help her .	3

if i die, i die i've been suffering from an extreme fear of germs for the last 5 years, and it's taking over almost every aspect of my life. i feel anxious all the time and ended up isolating myself even from my own family. the weird thing is that i didn't notice how much my mysophobia was affecting me until i got into an argument with my mother when she was cleaning yesterday (because she was wearing my flip flops). i don't want to describe my routines because i don't want to make it worse for my fellow germophobes, and please do not describe yours . after the argument, i started reflecting on my actions and after reading some articles i sort of accepted the fact that there is no escaping germs and that most of the things i do on a daily basis are futile. now i'm not saying that i'm cured, i'm just saying that i kind of accepted that fact which is a huge step for me to be honest. so what am i going to do from now on? i think i might get over this on my own without therapy so i'll try that first. i'll slowly but surely cut down on my bad habits; i'll still be cautious but i'll try to wash my hands a few times less. i'll also put more trust in my immune system since it did a really good job protecting me during my childhood, especially the three years i spent in the dorms of my middle-school away from my family. did you suffer from mysophobia? and are you cured? if so then please tell me how.	9

getting too high this did occur today btw but i smoked some weed i had from a previous time and was met with an uncomfortable experience. so when i smoke i felt nothing for a minute then all of a sudden it hit me. this sense of impending doom. but that's not all. it would all start out with my feeling it then realizing it in my head. then i start to think damn this is what everyone else feels? why does it feel so crazy for me then? then i think oh shit it's because they forgot like everyone said it does. but still then another question remains why me? then i begin to think of all sorts of unpleasant reasons which furthers my sense of oh fuck this is it for me i shouldn't know or think these things i'm dead. but after that it's just like heh well at least i figured it out so i can be at peace that i found out. i begin to then have thought of people in the closest circle like family and friends and soon after how they had to find me dead like this. marijuana overdose. i feel like scum because of it but hey at least i figured it out. after that i get a feeling of wait no i should save those closest to me and protect them from the fucked thoughts i had then i begin to think of all the fucked up shit again. i also end up with this feeling like i was high before not as a teen or anything like that but as a baby. then it's just repeats this cycle of realization and deja vu helplessness and love all while making me feel like death is looming over my shoulder waiting for my to slip.this isnt the first time this has happened as well. maybe a few months ago i smoked once more with a couple of friends. only difference was i smoked alot more and feel asleep where i was trapped in my own thoughts. homies said it lasted for about a half hour before i came out of it. they said i was tripping but this today confirms my thoughts. even now i want to smoke again just to feel it again so i can confirm how i felt was true. but i flushed it so that isn't happening obviously my past self knew what to do so ima trust myself. even recorded myself while it was happening to confirm. maybe i was just too high but i refuse to ignore those feelings. the only positive that came from this is the true feelings i have to my friends and family. even if it only confirms my thought that i had in the back. i truly love my family and i would hate to disappoint them. just thought i'd post this here cause i actually fucked up and feel like shit because of it. call me a pussy or whatever but this it how i feel and just thought i'd share it even if it doesn't change anything. tldr: i got high as shit	4

i envy the southern christian family life. for backstory i live in a small town in south carolina, so right in the bible belt. my family is/was military, we moved a lot and weren't religious at all. low country sc was where we moved to last before my dad got out of the marines. i don't know, i just see all the southern families and their life just seems so simple on the surface. live in some suburban neighborhood. spend quality time with the family together, get drunk on some nights at the neighbors house, go to church together on sundays. it all seems serene. don't get me wrong, i've lived here long enough to know the lies and toxicity that these 'core family values' type family exists. and even though i'm not religious, it all just seems like a peaceful way to live, disregarding the terrible values most people who live here have. do i sound like a nut job?	10
redefining what it means to be a woman in today's world where women seem to think it's up to them to tell men how they should behave, i thought maybe we would want to do the same. write down qualities you would like to see changed in women, or qualities you like that they have in general. i'll start: i like women with full development, physically, some women these days are too skinny. beyond the physical stuff, i like women who have a good head on their shoulders. who don't complain about society screwing them over, who acknowledge they have no limitations placed on them in 2018. i don't want a woman who forces ideologies on others. i don't want a woman who posts pro feminist "when women are empowered xyz" crap because i believe women are empowered. i want a woman who acknowledges she is empowered and has the freedom to do what she wants. who is kind hearted and caring, with enough intelligence and go-getter attitude to get a good 60-100k job anytime she chooses to, but electing to become a mother instead. at least for the earlier years in particular. list your ideal women	8

telling a black kid in my class he should try dyeing his hair with kool-aid. this was back in high school but it still haunts me to this day. i was in history class and our teacher had put us into study groups of 4-5. so naturally we weren't doing much of anything. the other kids in my group (two white kids and one hispanic girl along with j, the black kid) were talking about random things and got on the subject of hair dye. one of the girls was talking about going blond and this kid said, 'man i'd like to dye my hair red but it's hard for black people to dye their natural hair.' i was really into hair dye (still am) and had recently remembered a method of hair dye where yoh could use sugar free kool-aid and cold water to somewhat dye your hair. so i told him, 'you could dye it with kool-aid.' *i didn't know about the fucking kool-aid stereotype!* but you bet your ass everyone else at that table did. they all just sat there staring at me in mixed faces of horror and disbelief until j goes, 'daaamn sailo! ok so it's like that!' and just bust out laughing and everyone else started laughing as well. i was so damn confused. i didn't get what was so funny. and even though j laughed it off i think he was actually a little hurt because he avoided me for a bit. it wasn't until a few months later when i figured out by talking to friends what was so wrong about my statement and i wanted to die. i did apologize to j and explained that i didn't know about the stereotype. he was really cool about it and stopped avoiding me. still, goddamn.	12

here's my sad love story me : i love you girl : an electric motor is an electrical machine which converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. the basic working principle of a dc motor is: "whenever a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a mechanical force". the direction of this force is given by fleming's left-hand rule and its magnitude is given by f = bil. where, b = magnetic flux density, i = current and l = length of the conductor within the magnetic field. fleming's left hand rule : if we stretch the first finger, second finger and thumb of our left hand to be perpendicular to each other, and the direction of magnetic field is represented by the first finger, direction of the current is represented by the second finger, then the thumb represents direction of the force experienced by the current carrying conductor. above animation helps in understanding the working principle of a dc motor. when armature windings are connected to a dc supply, an electric current sets up in the winding. magnetic field may be provided by field winding (electromagnetism) or by using permanent magnets. in this case, current carrying armature conductors experience a force due to the magnetic field, according to the principle stated above. commutator is made segmented to achieve unidirectional torque. otherwise, the direction of force would have reversed every time when the direction of movement of conductor is reversed in the magnetic field. this is how a dc motor works!	4

and got myself banned from religious study and its exams by calling my teacher by his name so, this actually happened 9 years ago, but a post reminded me of it. i'm from the uk, i grew up in a small country village and spent most of my time in the local town out messing about/drinking (i was 15, shock and horror). i was in my final year at secondary school, the year before i hadn't studied religious education as it clashed with another class of mine. so as i walked into our first class of the year i saw our teacher who is often referred to as "the green giant" which is a reference to a cartoon character because he was over 7ft tall and me being the cocky bastard said "what's up john?", massive mistake. he pointed at the door and bellowed for me to get out, go to the office and never come back. i personally thought this was a massive over reaction, never come back? turns out, the old fellow wasn't messing about, usually i'd just skip the office and go do something else at this point but i was baffled by his outburst i decided to just go to the office, the head of my year turned up and let me know that i wasn't to return to his lessons ever again. i thought "great! i was barely taught anything in those lessons anyway!", shrugged it off and used that lesson time to do coursework. fast forward to the end of the year when you take most of your exams (gcse's) in the uk, it was the day of the re exam and i had already planned out what i was going to put in the exam as i had spent my own time prepping for it, and felt better off than i would of been other wise. i turn up to the exam later that day and bam, my head of year is there (guy looked like count dracula and walked around with his hands behind his back, once asked me how he knew my family better than me, but that's another story), so this guy puts a hand up and walked infront of me, causing me to walk into his hand. "no tom, you were banned from any and all re lessons and exams", i was furious, this was an easy exam, it only counted as a half grade but i was trying to get into college and study physcology, computer science and music technology. i walked away very frustrated. i later found out that calling the re teacher by his name had only exacerbated my situation and they were trying to find a way to keep me as far away from that subject as possible. as a kid and even to this day i love asking the question "but why?", i love knowing more information and this would be great for school right? wrong. learn what they tell you and don't question it. my school was not a christian school, it had no religious aligning. so when i worked out that 88% of 3 years of teaching my re teacher provided was about christianity, i was shocked and honestly a bit disturbed. i presented this to our head teacher and was assured it would be dealt with. it wasn't and i got told by a teacher after i left that the school was worried i would bring this situation public attention and damage the schools reputation. p.s i didn't get into those courses for a couple of reasons out of my control, but just finished my first year of full-time work in the job/industry i love. it all works out in the end if you keep trying	0

i [24f] feel emotionally blackmailed/pressured into getting married by my conservative parents. i just turned 24 years old. i graduated from a good university 2 years ago and have been working full-time since in a pretty good job. i moved to a new city (actually planning on moving again soon) and have been living very independently. most days, i feel like i'm just constantly on the go and most of my time is spent at work, running errands/cooking/etc, or just hanging out with friends. i honestly am getting a bit tired of being single but dating seems more like a chore and i don't think it'll work out any time soon. i've been enjoying being single though & in no rush...i've made so many lifestyle changes over the past year that i'm literally glowing and unrecognizable from my past self. now, the issue: my parents are relatively conservative (they're not really 'strict' or controlling but they are just kind of oblivious to the kind of life i live, and how times have changed since they immigrated here from india in the 80s). my dad has had ongoing health issues for a while, but recently they have gotten a bit more serious. my parents had me in their mid/late 30s, a bit later than average. now that i've graduated and have a job, they're suddenly expecting me to get married. i said it might not happen til my late 20s, or ever if i don't find anyone, because even if i were to meet anyone any time soon, i don't want to rush into marriage. this is one aspect of my life i won't compromise on because growing up, my parents had a terrible marriage and i experienced a lot of dysfunction (won't get into details). even as a kid, i remember telling myself that my parents' marriage is an example of everything not to do. in fact, that's been a huge motivation for me to get out of the chaos and do better for myself. because of their age and because of my dad's health issues, my mom keeps pressuring me to get married within the next 1 or 2 years. uh...that's not going to happen. my dad recently started dialysis treatments, and he was really sad about the transition (understandably) and, the night before he started, he told me "it's going to be hard to adjust to but it'll be worth it. i need to be there to see your wedding". what wedding?! the closest thing i have to a relationship right now is an emotionally unavailable fuck buddy lol. plus, i don't really have the best mindset for healthy relationships...which i'm slowly trying to work on. she literally says things like "don't you want your parents to be alive to be for your wedding?". she's even starting to look for random guys ("doctors and engineers") in india, who are looking to marry someone in america so that they can get their parents us visas or whatever. i told her that i will absolutely not marry anyone who grew up in india because i can't relate to them and plus most of those guys have grown up in such a misogynistic culture. i'm not completely opposed to being set up with someone, just to meet them, but my parents were never really social and don't have the network that some of my friends' parents do. she even admitted it would be difficult to find someone in the us, and that she doesn't have that social circle. i love my mom but i can't believe how oblivious she is being. i feel like i'm being emotionally blackmailed. my brother is in the same boat, and he's 5 years older than me. however, they've been giving him more slack because he's a guy and he can afford more time. but i'm a girl so my biological clock is ticking and i'll lose value as i get older, and all the 'good guys will be taken' if i don't act now. i know my parents don't have bad intentions but it's just sad to see how brainwashed they are. tl;dr: i'm being pressured into getting married by my parents (particularly my mom) when i'm no where near close or ready	11

sending my family a picture my parents like to spend birthdays together, but they couldn't spend my birthday yesterday with me because i'm temporarily living abroad. now i don't care at all about that (sort of almost estranged from them), but they were pretty upset, so i sent them some pictures from a birthday party my friends threw for me. about 30 seconds after i sent the pictures, i realized one of them was a picture with my wrist exposed - the same wrist with a tattoo that my parents don't know about. my watch usually covers it, but it wasn't at that particular time. they haven't seen the text yet, but the tattoo is pretty clearly visible. that'll be a fun conversation	12
best night i just had to tell you guys, last night was the best i've had in a while. story time: so about 2 weeks ago, my long term boyfriend unexpectedly dumped me. we are supposed to be friends, and he has been encouraging me to move on, but i just haven't had the drive. i go out for a little while, get sad, go home. last night: i went out and saw this guy, whom we will call j and his friend p. i've hung out with j previously and so i went and harassed him. they managed to drag out of me that i'd been brutally dumped, so they made it their mission to distract me and have a good time. well, at some point my ex shows up and comes to say hello. he makes some "so are these guys keeping you company" comments and jets off to play darts. my mood visibly changed and my escorts for the night notice, deduce what is up and are shocked because apparently they went to high school with the ex. so they conspire and decide it's time to change venues. as we are leaving, we pass that dart boards, so he sees me leave with two dudes that he knows. his face was priceless and according to my sources, he quickly abandoned darts in favor of heavy drinking. so we went and played pool, then chilled at j's house until 6 am. i had so much fun for the first time since the break up. i actually think i can get through this.	8

going on a bushwalk alone this only happened yesterday and i'm still trying to get over how it happened. we have been having some pretty shit weather lately (it's meant to be summer here) and yesterday was surprisingly very hot. since i wasn't working for once i decided to get out and enjoy the sun. unfortunately all my friends either study or work so no one was free to come for a walk with me. so i decided to go alone. near where i live is a national park with a lot of walking tracks, beginner, medium and hard. i wanted to challenge myself so i chose a 1 and a half hour round trip medium track (i'm not very athletic or fit.) managed to haul myself to the top in 35 minutes which i was incredibly proud of, took some niceish photos and decided to get out of the sun and back into the bush. i hadn't even been walking back 10 when i tripped on a tree root and fell forwards landing on my shin/knees. unfortunately for me, right where i landed a tree root had grown over a rock, providing a lovely landing pad, and resulting in a dint and gash in my leg. after screaming for 5 minutes (i was about 98% sure there was no one else on the track) i managed to text my mum to tell her what i'd done. she immediately rung to see if i needed help getting down which i said no to. we hung up and i kept walking. not even 1 minute later i started feeling sick and like i was about to pass out. call mum again and tell her to come get me. ended up at a&e (because mum didn't want to touch the mess that had become my shin) where they glued me up and sent me home. spent last night very uncomfortable with the heat and my leg and had to go to work today and explain to everyone why i was hobbling around tl;dr: went for a bushwalk alone. tripped and smashed my shin on a rock at the top of the track. mum had to rescue me and take me to the hospital to get fixed up	17
i've been craving a mcdonalds filet-o-fish sandwich for a few weeks... i've been craving a mcdonalds filet-o-fish sandwich for a few weeks... today i finally went. i had to run and pick up a prescription for a family member and on the way, i saw a mcdonald's. i immediately think, "hey, i can get that filet-o-fish i've been craving!". so i go through the drive through and decide i'd get two. i only eat mcdonald's about once a year, so i thought i'd just indulge a little. 2 filet-i-fish and a small coke! i got my order and headed over to the pharmacy. it was this really small mom and pop place. just the counter and a few seats to sit. the pharmacist said it would be about 10 minutes so i took a seat. my stomach did a weird rumble. it cramped. my butt felt like it was about to explode. no problem. nobody else is here so i lean over a little bit and let one out. not bad, not smelly. ok. not ok. it got worse. i look around, no bathroom, everyone is out of sight doing pharmacy stuff. i panic. i remember that there was a walgreen's a block away (they aren't my family member's regular pharmacy). i walk over, butt cheeks clenched, and ask one of the workers where there restroom is. "i'm sorry, we don't have a public restroom." wat. "but there *is* a safeway a few blocks away", she tells me. i felt my butthole spasm as if it was going to explode. head for the door. there is a grimy thrift store just half a block away so i walk carefully over and ask the nearest person where there restroom is. she lets me know and tells me the code to get in. i get in. i open the stall. toilet is stuffed with toilet paper and crap. there's no way i can use it. there's another stall, and i open the door. it's good. i barely made it. tl;dr: filet-o-fish made me blast a crap.	18

ignoring a guy with his finger in my butt! yep, this is one of the most awkward experiences of my life. this was a few months ago while i was seeing a doctor for a checkup after experiencing some unusual pain. so we go through the usual chat about what is wrong and possible causes etc and the moment i've been dreading comes. "well, i'm going to need to take a look". by all means random stranger, please have a good look and poke around. i do as instructed and get into position on the examination table, doing the best i can not to shred that annoying sanitary paper stuff they use nowadays. in he comes and gives me a warning before going at it. it's super weird and uncomfortable but as you do i just made the best of the foetal position and tried not to think about it. so he's prodding away while umming and ahhing to himself and then the worst happens. he says something. i have no idea what he has said, all i can hear is the ringing in my ears from tinnitus and my lack of attention. i took a while to try to figure it out but i just had no idea. so now i was stuck in that weird place, you know the one, where you are in a club and you can't hear someone and you wonder if you should ask them to repeat themselves or just laugh and brush it off. well, i opted for doing and saying absolutely nothing at all. so here i am with a dudes finger in my butt just standing, waiting for something...a reply, and action? i have no idea. eventually he just aborted and ended the exam but the whole time i was getting dressed i was kicking myself for not asking him to repeat himself. i just can't think of a more awkward time to not hear someone. it has bugged me ever since that i will never know what i was supposed to do. one thing i will say though is definitely pay full attention to anyone that has their fingers inside you. tldr: i was having a rectal exam and my doctor said something to me and paused expectantly. i didn't know what to do so i just stayed perfectly still and silent. so much cringe...	9

anyone else find that facebook depresses them? it's hard not to compare yourself to others. i find it difficult to see the friends i used to be great friends with moving on with new groups of people, forgetting about me basically when we all grew up together. or people posting exciting news and here i am, comparing myself	14
not sure what to name this.. things are just happening so fast kinda weight post but here it goes. it has been about 4 months since i have decided to join the marines. i'm that amount of time i have done so much to be eligible. my life in general feels like it has been going on the fast setting. just right now i realized this. let's starts with the most "shocking" thing. when i was little i used to be very obese. not sure if anyone reading this can relate to this but, when i jumped, everything jiggled. when i ran, i was out of breath, every second i used to look forward to eating. yet when i looked in the mirror i was disgusted. i have spent the years between 8th grade and 12th grade wanting to lose weight and struggling to keep it off. now, well, it all happened so fast. 4 months ago i was "skinny fat" i remember how i still had "man boobs" and everything was bouncy. a few minutes ago i woke up from a nap and you know how when you're asleep you do dumb shit? (well i do.. i have some stories lmao) ok so i woke up touching my self (not like that ) i sleep without a shirt and like i was passing my hand over my chest and i remember how it was bouncy and shit but now it's firm. arms too, back etc. i guess what i'm sayin is, i spend so many years trying to lose weight and having setbacks so often but now i'm just 4 month im in a better shape than i've ever been in. i never imagined i'd be here and to me it's shocking how i transformed my body from being jiggly to having muscles left and right in such a small amount of time. throughout all of this i have changed my name too. this is a huge accomplishment in 2 ways. i have had sever selective mutism and social anxiety for years and for me to go into a count room and explain my reasons, go to every government building and request my files changed is freakin huge. i mean like throughout all of this i, 1. got a mind of myself and went with it(changed my name against my parents wishes) 2. talked to so many people 3. i was clueless on how and what to change but i went out of my way to figure out without someone holding my hand. i have always hated my birth name and i guess now i officially say, "i love my name" without being ashamed to tell people what it was when they asked. here a big one too. i woke up and i was like "lol.." "you can do pull ups" "whaaaaat" lmao because it's like a reality check. the last thing i needed to be eligible to join the marines is to be able to do pull ups. i started wanting to join by not even being able to pick up a 20lb dumbbell. i can do 15 pull ups now like wtf? that's amazing. i'm terrified of what i'm going to go through in boot camp. i honestly am. like i mentioned, i suffered from social anxiety and selective mutism and i'm going to be 100% out of my comfort zone. sure i'm terrified but i'm also really excited. i have wanted this for so long and it's finally within reach. it's like being in that pitch black tunnel for decades and finally being able to see that light at the end of the tunnel. it's all been happening so fast i haven't really had time to process it all. i have achieved so much but i have a long way to go though and i intend on getting there.	7

most of my friends stopped talking to me ever seance the social distancing stuff and lock down i've been texting my friends almost daily. this isn't out of the ordinary coz we do that even before the sick. but after a while we slowed down texting, like 4 times a week. but dam we haven't hung out in what end of february. that's a long time. and now i'm pretty sure they have blocked me, i haven't been spamming or anything just like asking of they are ok and if they need anything. like my whole friend group got the corona at one point so i just was checking on them. well after everyone got better we started talking less and then i would text them every 3 days or so and ask how they are doing and if they wanted to talk. well no own responses. i've had some thoughts about our friendships and they were pretty legit but dang. really makes a man sad when everyone ghost me , i just want to talk. i've been going though a rough time lately. try to talk to them and they don't respond like i only text them once a week now , and they don't text back. this is big sad . started drinking since they stopped. i need some human interaction, like at least say hi. i really am sad now and don't really want to exist because then i will be more sad. if some how you read though this i am on mobile so formatting is bad and not even the telemarketers will response. really just just don't like it like the shit if life .	2

my struggles with infatuation and missing important signs. anybody else struggle with the same thing? hi guys. i'm a 21 year old woman and have been dating since i was 15. ever since my first relationship or taste of love i've totally jumped into relationships just to try and orchestrate the feeling of true love. it was especially bad in my late teens. i would find someone and be so into the idea of being with them and be completely obsessed that i would commit way too soon and find later that i actually did not spend any time learning about them in a non biased way and realized i had no idea who i was in a relationship with apart from how they made me feel. this led to me detaching abruptly once the infatuation went away and i was just as shocked as they were. it was almost like i was fabricating this ideal relationship without any true connection and they were experiencing it as real and true. which i'm sure led to so much pain for them and confusion. i wasn't heartbroken i was just more upset and hard on myself as i felt like i had let myself down again. almost like coming back to reality and being like how did i get here?!? now i'm 21 and single for the first time in a while. i've been single about 3 months and i sort of vowed to myself to be super loving to me and try to find what i've been seeking in myself. i've been going to therapy for 2 months and also have been experiencing platonic intimacy outside of committed relationships which has totally helped with my need for "true love" and a partner. i've realized that i had totally been seeing these men in a self seeking way. i only saw them as this ideal/expectation and not a whole person. which is totally selfish but i wasn't aware. i recently went on a date with this guy and i could feel myself idealizing after our first date. i didn't even know the guy and i wanted to see him every day and already was wondering if he was seeing anyone else. he wasn't texting me constantly so i assumed something was wrong with me which led me to want to control and find out what he thought of me. basically i over commit because i am so fucking terrified of being rejected and alone. i think i subconsciously jump in to things so i can feel a false sense of security and love. which totally makes me over look anything about them which i don't like. sorry about the rant but i hope this helps anyone in the same position i found myself in for years. here's to creating new patterns and behaviors in our lives	3

i'm tired of people always commenting on how quiet i am hey guys, i'm new to reddit and just found this thread. i've been thinking a lot about this and have wanted to randomly vent on the internet to strangers about it and this seems like a good place to do it. i've always been shy and lean more toward the introverted side. i also think i may have mild social anxiety, but it really depends on the situation. parties are not fun for me if i know few or no people, and i feel awkward a lot when i make small talk. but i've always felt awkward in the workplace. i've had quite a few jobs throughout college and now i am a recent graduate and have had my first full time jobs. i currently work in a medical billing office, and i don't enjoy it. i graduated with a degree in marine biology and love the ocean, but where i currently live is nowhere near the ocean or anything related to it (no aquariums). so i'm at this current job just to make money. my husband is in his last semester of his undergrad so hopefully when he graduates we will be able to move somewhere by the ocean . so that's just the backstory here: i'm at a cubicle job that i find brain-numbing and am a quiet, introverted gal. at my workplace i work in an office with about 8 other medical billers. they're all very nice and helpful, but have all known each other for months or years and all seem like good friends. i am new and don't know anyone and spend the majority of my days sitting quietly at my desk working, which i have no problems with. i actually enjoy working independently and being able to get lost in my own thoughts. people at my work always (like at least once everyday) mention to me or about me that i am "so quiet". one woman i sit across said to me "radical_spatula, the fact that you're so quiet is starting to bother me! you need to talk more!!!" i found this annoying because i am naturally quiet and don't really want to speak all the time like my coworkers usually do. many people i work with are loud and love to talk, which is fine. but it's just not me. i'm tired of being told i "need to talk more". also, whenever i do speak (i do talk occasionally- i'm not a psychopath), that same woman will mock surprise and will say something like "woah there, i'm not used to hearing you speak! you'll have to ease us into it haha!" does anyone else have this? i just find it annoying that it seems to bother my coworkers that i am introverted and enjoy working in peace.	0
ran away from cinema. wants to meet up again? so confused! (no film spoilers) so i'm [16/m] and i went round a girls house, [14/f] who i absolutely adore. i went to hers to watch captain america the first avenger and the winter soldier before going to see the new film civil war. it was just me and her at her house (her brother was upstairs tho, and her parents were there for a bit of the day then they left), it was a load of fun there were some kinda flirtatious moments i think idk. but we then went to watch civil war. her friend came along which i didn't mind and we sat and watched the film. throughout the entire thing she was really happy and everything seemed normal, she was laughing whispering to me funny things in the cinema making references to other stuff... but, when the credits started to come on she said she needed the toilet so she left to go to there, then me and her friend stayed to watch the first end credits scence then her friend then went to go find out where she, the person that i like, went and she said she would wait. i stayed until the end of the credits to see if there was another secret ending, i then got a text from the person i like saying that, "we had to leave to get home", it was at this point i realised i still had her hat that she left at the cinema, i texted back "i still have your hat, you left it" to which she then replies "oh shit we can so something next weekend and you can gibe it back" (the text has some spelling errors as that is what she sent me) so i rushed out the cinema and they weren't there they had gone despite saying they would wait. i then spent the next hour waiting for a bus to take me home. when i did get home i texted her this, "well getting home was an adventure i had a ton of fun today! thanks for letting me eat your food and thanks for seeing ca with me! it was an amazing day thank you (her name)" she replied "yeah thanks for coming!!" so now i'm really confused, i thought the day went really well but i don't know how she felt, i feel abandoned because they left me but then she wants to meet up next week? does that mean she had fun? i honestly don't know. please anyone give me some advice on what to do, i'm like really lost! (also i don't know if she likes me all i know is that i like her any help on identifying this would be great thanks) tl;dr : i go to the person i liked house, had a great time watching two films, goes to cinema with her and friend, everything normal, they leave without me despite saying they would wait, she forgets her hat says we can do something next week, i'm left really confused. help! this post may be deleted just incase she searches the texts to see if i've said anything.	1

being too horny in no nut november this happened in november, i was attending nnn for the fun of it. i was a few days in when i started getting horny very easy. so this day my crush sent a text saying "if i had to say yes, what would you ask?" then the urges came, i sent "what do you think " not thinking much of it. then later we were texting when she asked "what did you mean by that?" i could've said that i wanted to ask her out or to be my girlfriend. no no no my dear friends, i said that i wanted to fuck her. she got very angry and said i only see her as a fuckdoll and to fuck off. i apologised profusely but it didn't matter, she ignored me for a good few days. we talk again now but everytime i say something stupid she gets mad. i fucked up my chance of getting a girlfriend. she now has a boyfriend and i am still devastated by it. tl:dr horny me said that i wanted to fuck my crush instead of being romantic	17
at the end of the golden girls s4e22 the girls make a pact to always stay together, even if they all have to go into a nursing home together. then it gets somber and rose says, "what happens when only one of us is left?"... the episode is called sophia's choice and is about sophia breaking her friend out of a retirement home worse than shady pines. after only a few days of living there though, the girls quickly realize taking care of her is too much to handle and try other options. rose finds a nice retirement home that blanche is going to help pay for and after that conversation they all sit in silence thinking about the inevitable that happens when you get older. rose comes up with the idea for them all to stay together, even if it means going into one together, and then she hit us with that line from the title. sophia makes a joke about how she'll be able to handle being the last one basically but man that hit the feeeeels.	14

how do guys like to be flirted with over text/snapchat? i've kinda realized that i'm a little mean to the boy i like. we are friends as of rn but we used to hookup a while ago and nothing serious ever came of it. he calls me pretty and stuff but he's really not over his ex dumping him so i'm helping him through that bc he is depressed ( ). i'm kinda bad at giving compliments/flirting but i want him to know that i really like him. unfortunately i'm the type of girl who teases/is mean to a guy when i like him but thats hard to do over text without looking like a bitch. anddd ive kinda been a bitch to him unintentionally bc sometimes it's rlly hard to hear the guy you like talk about how he's depressed over his ex. do guys really appreciate it when you say he looks nice/good morning texts, etc? i know that sounds obvious but if there are other things they prefer more i would appreciate hearing that too.	2
i [16m] had this texting convo with my crush [16f]. does my reasoning about her she seeming interested make sense? i go to an all boys school and she goes to a public school. she knows i like her. (*i had this conversation with her over text*) me: u guys got any major events coming up? her: umm not rly? tbh i don't rly know haha me: we have prom in may. hbu guys? her: oh prom yes haha ours is like in 2 weeks me: i didn't ask anyone to it in my school yet but like i'm not sure who i'll go with so that'll be interesting her: wait don't u go to an all boys school me: yeah y? her: o i was j wondering lol me: yea hopefully i don't have to go with a boy her: lol it could be fun if u j go w friends! me: everyone just asks ppl from other schools lol her: makes sense my reasoning: girls say that they text in all caps when they are excited, so it seems like she is interested in prom. also, she asked me if i go to an all boys school. if she weren't interested at all, she wouldn't have asked, right? tl;dr- i had this text conversation with my crush, and am wondering if she seems interested.	12

how do you deal with a one sided relationship. so i'm (m23) in love with a girl (f22). we were childhood friends and used to have a great bond back then.we had seperated during our high school as i was made to join a different school by my parents. but few years later, during my first year of college she sent me a message on facebook messenger. we exchanged our whatsapp number. and we have been chatting daily ever since. we have been in a casual long distance relationship for over 5 years now. casual as in we would chat every day and talk about our feelings but she insisted to maintain the relationship platonic throughout. to which i agreed at that point unwillingly because i really liked to talk to her. she had a boyfriend too at that time. with whom she broke up after a year due to some trust issues as they were in a long distance relationship. around after a month she broke up with him , i asked her out 'online' as we were in different cities. to which she said that she needed time to get over him. but later i found out that she had already dated and broken up with another guy too during the same time. i felt bad about this, but since we weren't dating i didn't mind that and moved on. anyways ,we kept talking and after a year we started meeting in person more often. and as we kept meeting , i started falling in love with her over and over again , she's really beautiful and cute and has a very calm nature that could melt a guy's heart instantly. one day on chat we were talking about gifts and out of nowhere she said that she wanted to gift me something , so she told me to ask her anything. so i said that i wanted a kiss. she agreed to kiss me , but only if it's a romantic place and the kiss should not affect our friendship. i agreed to that and after a few months we finally got to that place and it was exactly as she had described, we were sitting inside a fort and we were sitting right below the stars ,the lights were perfect, we talked for a while about our life and discussed about stars and then we paused for a while i knew this was the perfect timing and i took the first step , i took my head towards her and she did the same and we finally kissed. it was the best kiss of my life. we finished our meet with a long and tight hug and then we went back home. now few days after the kiss i tried to chat with her again and i mentioned that it was a great moment we had and tried to discuss about it and then all of a sudden she went all defensive and said thatwhy are we talking about it, it's done right? i gave you the gift. why are you talking about it again. and said that this kiss should not affect our freindship and all that stuff. now she is right technically , but when we kissed i did feel that she was really enjoying it and i thought its was finally my break out of the friendzone. but her sudden change of attitude felt wierd. i'm finding it really difficult to get over her. she's really beautiful and we have a great bond. how can i get over her, it looks impossible forgive me as i'm not a great story teller but i tried to describe the situation as good as possible. here are few things i would like to get help for. q1) is it normal for friends of opposite sex to do these things? and am i in the wrong or bad if i still have feelings for her? q2) should i stop being friends with her in order to stop being in this one sided relationship. will it be fair for her, as she really relies on me for emotional support as she suffers from depression from time to time. and she only trusts me to talk about these stuff. q3) should i still keep trying to get out of the friendzone even after all these things that happened with us? tl;dr: one sided love with my best friend (f22). we have been in a casual long distance relationship for over 5 years now.	4

so i work at an escape room, and need advice for dealing with rude teenagers. i get it, i'm sure i was a rude teenager every once in a while too, and we all have bad days so it's not a huge deal, but this week especially has been super bad and i feel like i'm maybe not handling the situation correctly. before i tell you the problem, i'm only 20. so i'm not some super old adult that just "doesn't understand" teenagers. anyway, here goes. so as mentioned previously, i work at an escape room. the past 3-4 days we've had probably around 10 groups of teenagers ages 14-17. they're not allowed to do the escape room without someone above 18 signing their waiver for them, but their parent/guardian does not have to be in the room with them, which seems to be the main issue. in these 3-4 days, these groups of teens have broken 6 puzzles (which are not the easiest to replace), and have given such an attitude about it that a few of my employees have actually either started crying, or have had to go on break because they're upset about it. we've been mocked for sending hints that had information they already know in it (we have prewritten hints that are easier to use than typing up our own for most situations), we've been flipped off, sworn at, and just all in all made fun of for what seems to be no reason. i don't feel like we deserve to be treated this way, but when i have politely brought it up to 1-2 groups i've made it worse and they've played the victim even though i just gently reminded them that we are human and sometimes make mistakes. tldr; how do i get groups of teenagers to respect my escape rooms/property, and how do i deal with a sour attitude of teenagers that is hurting my employees emotionally? sorry for the wall of text	9

i was raped at 12 years old... hi i'm ally, this is the story of when i was raped four years ago. for the few of you that see this and read all the way through, thank you, i'm sorry it's so long. let me take you back in time, so that you can understand what i have to say. on this day, at 7:30pm(est) exactly four years ago on january 1st, 2017, my family came over to celebrate the new year. new years eve we did fireworks and fun, the normal traditions. but the following night(tonight), was just for the two sets of parents. so, they left the house at 8:53pm(est), but not before they left my brother(16), in charge of, my my four cousins(14m,15m,15m,16m), my younger cousin(11f), and me(i was 12). so, everything was good for about the first fifteen minutes, the boys were being boys in the other room, playing some game, etc... and my cousin(11f, we'll call her sophia) and i, we were the only girls in the house and much younger than the boys so we were in the living room having fun with ourselves. reliving some trends like the "damn daniel", harambe, various challenges, and just having a good time. but, like i said, about fifteen minutes later the boys room was quite and we didn't think much of it we thought they were focused gaming or maybe starting a movie. but then the five of them come out excited and messing with each other. this wasn't out of the ordinary so sophia and i didn't think much of it, and we had no reason to distrust our family. they then grabbed a quick drink, came over to us and ask what we were doing, if we were having fun, etc.. we invited the boys to join with the challenges. then they said they had a new game, where the lights are off, and someone had to catch everyone moving when they randomly hit the lights back on. sophia and i thought that was fun, especially with a big group. keep in mind it's only been 20min since our parents left. so, the game begins and the first round was normal, but then things took a dark turn in the second round, it was dark and sophia and i couldn't see each other, but then i heard sophia scream and i ran over to help her in a heart beat, but then someone grabbed me, and covered my mouth with their hand. then the next second i knew the lights were on and sophia and i are forced on the couch. two of them holding us down while the other three undressed us and put our underwear in our mouths to keep us from screaming. we were squirming and trying to fight ourselves free, yelling at them to stop, begging, and pleading. but they kept telling us to, "shut up" or "you'll enjoy it", etc... and since sophia and i were both virgins we were both terrified, and i knew that since i was the oldest between the two of us, i have to look after her. but then they got undressed and pulled their dicks out of their underwear, that's when sophia began to cry, and i began to cry, fight, and scream even more. i went into overdrive. but it was no use. then i'm sure you guys can figure out what happened for the next hour and a half. they were never caught, and sophias' screams still haunt me from time to time. i felt so powerless to save her, we never reported them because we were, embarrassed, traumatized, and terrified of them. we talk about it from time to time, but sophia is way stronger and smarter than i am, she was able to get her life straight afterwards. but, my personality was never the same, and it made me who i am today, i could've been completely different if it weren't for that one night. in the four years since, my brother over dosed on heroine. sophias' parents along with her youngest brother(the 14m) passed away in a car accident. her two 15 year old brothers, are in prison. and her older 16 year old brother, married and moved to canada. sophia now lives with me and my parents(her aunt and uncles' place). i'm going to be 17 in february and sophia will be 16 june. most rapes are done by people the victims know well, i have never felt comfortable opening up about this, until recently, here felt like a safe and meaningful place to put our story. if you have been raped, speak up! no matter how terrifying it can be, reach out there for help, even if it's here on reddit. we have to support one another. this is something that no one should have to experience, and i wouldn't wish it on anyone. and if you are planning on raping someone, please, i beg of you don't. it may make you feel good for a few minutes, an hour, maybe two or whatever, but the trauma that person experiences and the potential guilt is long lasting. and if you don't care, well then go fuck yourself! imagine if someone rapped you! and to anyone who feels insecure around people because of this, don't be afraid to have some things to defend yourself with, and try to avoid those scenarios where you could be alone with them if possible, and if you can't tell them you have to leave, invite someone, or be somewhere in public. i wish i could say more but this is already very long. so thank you for attending my ted talk, enjoy your new year!	12

so i have to confess... the year is 2016 -- 14 year old me enjoying life before enter the pit of hell of what we call "high school". i used to have a crush on this girl that i knew & it was honestly the craziest crush i've ever had on a girl. so it's summer, my school attended this spin class called soul cycle ever tues & thurs. so i believe it was thursday i don't exactly remember, i just remembering younger me walking her back to school every time the class was over so she could go to her after school program where she waits for her mother to pick her up. after i was almost a block away from my school on my way to the metro station, i'd forgotten to give her water bottle to her because we were given free water at the end of the class for attending. so i had two waters with me, one was mine & the other was hers. i had no idea which one was mine, but i'd remember putting mine into my book bag so i'd grabbed mine from my book bag & began to drink from it. so 14 year old me could not still the feeling of wanting to kiss her every time i'd say her. so i'd came to the idea of drinking her water bootle & which i did. i didn't know why i wanted to do it, maybe because i was tired of not be able to kiss her so this was the free-trial to doing it. then, i ended up feeling very jittery & happy as hell . i then went home to where i didn't feel good & remember that she didn't feel so well that week of school from a cold even though it was summer. ended up throwing up, having a fever, and staying home from school for the rest of the week. and that's how i managed to get sick from my crush. nobody knows about this story, until now	1

macroeconomics professor makes economics a little less tedious i just really appreciate my macro professor. he's super young (i wanna say 26 or 27) with a phd, and obviously ridiculously smart. now, i'm a performing arts major so the kind of stuff we talk about in class is certainlyyyyy not in my wheelhouse. but my professor is so enthusiastic and passionate about economics that i can't help but be interested. for example, today he scheduled a 3-hour-long review session to prepare for our final. it wasn't mandatory or anything, but he prepared a practice exam with 85 sample questions (!!!). when i walked in he was wearing this ridiculously extravagant velvet maroon blazer with a black bowtie. i smiled and said "i love the blazer!" to which he replied "it's finals time y'all! i had to wear my favorite one!" he told me it was his "finals blazer." how cute he just does so much to make our class more fun. the material can be ridiculously hard at times, but he's really patient. and he's quick to help you, as long as you reach out. we need more professors like this one in the world!!!	1
my [26f] mom [55f] accidentally irreparably damaged my car without my permission background: i'm currently living at home working part time for six months before returning to grad school in the fall. this whole ordeal started because my mom's car was on the fritz. she asked to borrow mine that day to get to/from work while she was having it towed/looked at. i said yes, and she proceeded to ask me the next three days to do the same. it was very inconvenient and she could have been a lot more respectful of me and my time (once asked at 11:30pm when i was already sleeping over at my bf's and she needed to leave at 6 am -\_\_-) but whatever it's my mom. however, four days after this all began, at 10:30pm, i get a text from her stating: >it is with great sympathy that i must report that your car is dead. it died earlier and i have been trying to revive it since 2:30 ish. it will be towed to (auto shop) later. i was planning on renting a car until mine is fixed. you can take it in the morning. i don't know what will happen after that. as it turns out, my mom used my car (prius) to jump my sister's \[28f\] car, and then my car died. they spent the whole day trying to get it revived behind my back (hoping they could fix it and tell me about it later). while i don't know much about cars, i know that i would never have tried using my prius to jump another car because it runs differently. more importantly, i **never** would've taken liberties like that with someone else's car they were letting me borrow without at least contacting them first. i would **not** have approved this had they asked me first. surprise surprise we later learn from the auto shop that you should never use a prius in that way, and that repairs are going to cost an amount neither i nor my family can afford. aka i'm most likely out of a car. which stunts my ability to work part time. and i have to find different housing for grad school. not to mention the death of my social life these next couple months... :( i have a lot of building up feelings of resentment towards my mom about the entire situation. i'm angry that she felt so overly comfortable when borrowing my car that she 1) assumed i'd be able to drop everything and let her use it whenever 2) did not contact me before attempting to use my car to jump my sister's car 3) did not feel the need to tell me in the moment that my car had died, only when she knew there was no getting out of telling me and 4) she never really apologized or took responsibility -- using language like "your car died" vs. "i killed your car". i can't help but speculate that the attempts to revive the car after the fact also made it worse, which makes me even angrier that she didn't at least tell me at 2:30pm that my car was dead. obviously my mom didn't kill the car on purpose. plus, i'm staying at her home rent-free for 6 months, and while i know she enjoys having me here, i know is not something to take for granted. if this were anyone else this would be a different story. i have what i feel are justifiable feelings of rage, distrust, and disappointment, but i don't know how to let those out when it's my mom. i don't want to just let the resentment bottle up, but i also know it won't go away on its own. am i being reasonable faulting her for this? am i allowed to demand an apology? should i not try to be angry with her just because she's my mom? am i allowed to ask she put for the effort and resources into finding me a new car? do i have to just suck this up and move on? i think i'm just grasping for some feelings of control over this situation because at this point i've had none, but i'd appreciate any and all advice so i can stop alternating between seething and crying to move on tl;dr: my mom was borrowing my car and used it behind my back in a way i wouldn't have approved of, which led to it being essentially totaled. i'm absolutely furious, but know it was an accident and don't know how to proceed.	12

you ever feel so tired, it physically hurts to be awake? i got an hour last night so i drank two energy drinks today in about two hours of each other (i'm not an energy drink consumer but i was desperate) and instead of waking me up, they immediately sent me crashing even harder than i already was. i tried to nap while my toddler napped but while the drinks made me crash, my brain is going 100 mph and i still can't sleep. looks like melatonin for me tonight. it physically hurts and makes me nauseous to be awake right now and it's only 3 pm. so here's to making my first post in here after being a long time lurker, hoping to make some casual conversation to help pass the afternoon.	15

please help me remember the title! when i was a kid, maybe mid to late 90s/early 2000s i read a book that i can't remember the title of. i've been trying to figure out what it was called for years! the basic plot that i remember is a man (main character) goes through some kind of portal to another place/time. he doesn't know how he went through the portal, but it took him from modern times to some kind of ancient tribe that he didn't speak the same language as. i think he falls in love with one of the female members of this tribe. i don't recall anything else right now.	2

i (26f) am catching hard feelings for my fwb (32m) and i know he isn't. idk what to do. so the unfortunate reality behind this story is that i started sleeping with my coworker about 6 months ago after having a crush on him pretty much since i started at my job a year and a half ago. we have always been very casual about it. in fact in total we have only slept together 5 times. but he will often kiss me or hug me or hold my hand at work (when no one else is around. no one else at work knows about our relationship). he and i would not make a compatible serious couple, mainly due to the fact that he is from another country and culture. i am bilingual and speak his native language (and we have a bilingual workplace), but i am american and he is not, and he has traditional values from his culture which i do not share. so for that reason i do not see myself being able to ever marry him or anything, and he agrees. unfortunately, even though in my head i know it can't happen, i'm starting to have strong feelings for him. i literally wait all day at work for him to talk to me and go out of my way to see him just to get a smile or wave from him. when i see his name pop up on my phone i get so fucking happy. i constantly think about the times i've spent with him and how i felt in those moments. i think he is adorable as hell and i love his vibe, his voice, his body.... i know he isn't in love with me like i am with him. it's pretty clear. for one thing he will sometimes go days without contacting me. usually we talk at work but if he gets busy and we don't have a chance to talk, he doesn't make an effort to find me or to contact me after work. for another thing, in 6 months we've only slept together 5 times. i feel like if he had feelings for me he'd want to see me more often. he usually calls or texts me on the weekends, but sometimes he doesn't. and i know, i know, he totally doesn't have to. he isn't my boyfriend! i'm just saying this is how i know he doesn't feel the same way i do. so my question is... what now? i feel like i need to end our relationship to save my sanity. i literally obsess over him and the feeling is not reciprocated. btw, i have never told him that i feel this strongly about him. nor will i. like i said, i cant be with him for cultural reasons. it would be a damn mess. i suppose i'll just tell him it's over and stop talking to him, but unfortunately i have to still see him at work which is going to make forgetting about him fucking impossible... has anyone ever been through this? tips? advice? should i just get a different job? yes i know i'm stupid for getting myself into this situation... i thought i could have a fwb without catching feelings.. but i was very wrong.	2

i don't feel like a normal teenager i feel like i'm the only teenager who actually thinks. one who actually wants to fix the problems they have, one who actually wants to work for things instead of letting them find themselves out. because of working like this, i overthink things way too much, i have some mood swings of anger/sadness, i'm never fully happy, i can't relax knowing that i feel like next generation is doomed. i think social media has something to do with that, so i'm deleting every one but this because there's no drama and no one wants to show off their life or anything. plus, being a teenager and all,plus nothing good ever came out of it. lots of drama happens on it in my life, and i don't want that. so now i'm just really bored with my life, trying to do something outside, trying to get away from technology, but i'm so exhausted so i'm just watching a movie and scrolling through reddit i feel so useless. i feel like i'm searching for something but i don't know what it is, anything you guys want to say please comment i'm not in a great mood because of these thoughts rn :(	1

just learned to get over a rejection and i try to fill my times with positive things. how about you? yoop i feel so stupid for having a crush that rejected me haha. but shit happens,gotta move on. the rejection was not verbal, he just 'ghosted' my messages etc. shit happens as i said. how do you deal with a rejection (or even a breakup) in a positive way? i try to amuse myself over this. some people advised me to keep going because guys may be shy or whatever but i can't insist on someone who doesn't invest the same energy as i do into something. have a great day people! stay strong!	3
boys i fucked up i few days ago i was at my friends house, and i told him who i like. he is my only good friend so i thought i could trust him. for a few days it was fine until today where he went to a cookout with other kids from my school. he told some kids, and some kids heard because he's super loud. i learn this and i ask him. he denies it and i ask my other friends and they all say he told them, as he was the only one who knew. he is also in a relationship, when i was over his house he was calling another girl cute and he was telling me he was thinking about breaking up with his girl and going to her. i remember this and tell his girlfriend which she talks to him about it and breaks up with him. he is super sad now and i feel really badly	2

just wanted to share this with someone... so as the title says just wanted to share this cause i been super excited about it, but it all started about 3-4 weeks ago. me and my dad where talking about a new car cause i really don't like mine ( it's a new car with no features) and out the blue he told me he had a amplifier and subwoofer just sitting around and if i get the parts i can put it in my car. sadly no new car but that's where it started. next day bought everything i need, got it put in with some of his help and off i went. i was bitten by the car audio bug haha i really liked it but as my luck had it, the old stuff gave up on me within a week. what can you do, well there's one thing. go crazy about it. i ordered a new amp as soon as i had my paycheck, got it in the car the day it arrived and promptly blew up the 16 year old sub well ok, that couldn't stop me though. so i bought a new one, and put it in. also went to home depot to find some wood to wall of my trunk (still hasn't happened) got a great deal and went on my way with it. well i wanted something better yet again, then it came to my mind ! i had a sheet of mdf that i picked up like 2 days earlier and talked to my dad about building a box, he told me do my research and later that night my box was born. got that in the car and i was quiet happy. and then it hit me, bought new speakers, another amp, all new wires for power and couple other little things. now i'm almost done and i'm quiet excited because i'm taking the car to a competition this weekend, in a side note, my dad used to do sound quality competitions. so i got a lot of pointers in the right direction. so for the last 3 weeks i been putting together a whole system for my other wise extremely boring car and also found that it made it much more enjoyable going on drives with it. just felt like sharing this since i have no other friends that are in to sql competitions and wanted to share my happiness about it. edit: attempted formatting on mobile sort for the wall of space less text.	4

it's okay to be heartbroken by people you never "dated" hey y'all! just wanted a "little" post about love and heartbreak in a way i feel doesn't get talked about enough and it should so first i want to tell you a story about me. earlier this year i met this cute girl in one of my classes and we will call her rebecca. she was gorgeous with blonde hair and glasses.she was smart and had a great sense of humor. she was a girl i wanted to get to know better. through my awkwardness about a week or two after meeting her i got the courage to ask for her number and she obliged to give it to me. later that day i texted her and we talked for an hour or so then the line went dry. i was confused and didn't know what to do. well the next time in class i tried to talk to her like normal and everything seemed fine so after class i texted her and we texted again with the line ultimately going dry again. i was confused but i pressed on and decided to ask her out on a date. to my surprise she agreed and we went on our first date. this date went very well. we went out to lunch and walked around town talking and cracking jokes the whole day. after that we went on another date to the movies and sonic and talked way later than we should have just about life and everything. at this moment i had decided i wanted to have something more with this girl. however i wanted to take things slow and not rush into anything so we went on a few more dates and everything seemed to be going good. and one day i broke down and asked her if she wanted to just be friends or something more and she told me she didn't know. a day or so later she stopped responding to my texts. a few days passed and i had texted her almost every 6 hours cause i missed her and thought i had messed everything up. a few days after that i got a message from her saying that she "wasn't ready to be in a relationship. " the classic way to get out of a relationship before it officially starts. truthfully i don't blame her one bit. i still think she is the amazing girl from the beginning so...... i told y'all this really long story to explain to you what i went through with this girl rebecca who broke my heart even though we never dated,never kissed, never held hands. it's crazy to me to know that this girl left such an impact on me for the little time i knew her and the little time i spent with her. today i'm still not over her but recently i'm starting to move in the right path. (that's partly why i wrote this) the other reason is to show you that it is okay to love someone and be hurt by someone that didn't feel the same towards you or whatever the situation may be. stay strong and stay willing to love and you will make it through	3

how to get over someone?? i've had a crush on this guy i work with since like january. it's so beyond annoying i wish i could just make it go away. i'm really not one to get crushes i've had maybe 3 in my life. but this is the first time where i actually talk to and am kinda friends with the guy. that's actually what made me like him was when i got to know him. there was a point where i didn't see him for maybe a few weeks just because we weren't scheduled to work the same days and i thought ok i think i'm over my dumb crush but when i came in and he saw me he said my name like he was glad to see me and hugged me. he's really so sweet and nice and just easy to talk to and wow having a crush on someone is literally the worst thing ever please help	15
almost cutting my dick off with an angle grinder before today i considered myself to use the best practices when utilizing power tools. i used to be a diesel technician and have done a decent amount of metal fabrication. i had a change of careers 5 years ago and became a paramedic. i have seen a couple gnarly accidents when people aren't safe. one would think i would be the last guy to have an accident. today my neighbor asked for me to cut a 3/4 inch steel bar for a tractor of his. i agreed and took the bar back to my shop where my angle grinder is. i locked it in the vise with confidence and slapped on newer cut off disc. as i cut downwards into the bar i realized that metal dust was fragmenting into my tool box. i decided to cut upwards into the bar to prevent this. if you're not familiar with using an angle grinder you wouldn't know that you never want to cut upwards into something like this. i did. i was being an idiot. i was 90% into my upwards cut of the steel rod when suddenly the weight of the bar caused it to pinch the cut off disc. this instantaneously launched the angle grinder back at me. without a second to realize it was happening the grinder chassis grabbed my shirt and swung with the force of an nfl kicker into my family jewels. this forced me to let go of the grinder and keel forward in pain. letting go of the grinder allowed it grab my t-shirt with the disc and pulled towards my groin. i grabbed grinder chassis but at this point it was pulling my shirt into it harder than i could fight. i felt humming through my arms as the motor on the grinder locked up. afraid to let go of the grinder i pulled it away from my abdomen stretching my shirt beyond limit. it felt like i was holding a pit bull by its jaws as it tried to maul me. i managed to quickly back up pulling the power cord out of the wall socket. the garage went silent. i had a vietnam style flash back to every final destination scene i have watched. i will never ever make an upwards cut into an unsupported anything ever again. i attached photos of my shirt and just how close i came to amputating my own dick. i was horrified and considering i use the angle grinder every single day i am now terrified with the fact i did something so stupid. for the record i wore my safety glasses. tl;dr today i used an angle grinder improperly and almost caused potential penile amputation. [the aftermath showing me how close i was to becoming the eunuch from game of thrones](<url>)	1

need help figuring out if i [26m] did something wrong or she [22f] overreacted i was texting with this girl from a dating app and she ghosted me, even though we were planning on meeting. here is our last conversation: me: well where's your smile to prove how cute you are her: you can see my smiles on \[dating app\] me: they're not mine though! her: im not wearing make up so you aren't getting anything tonight me: boo lol. makeup is so overrated her: makeup is fun! me: but who doesn't like the real thing her: makeup is the real thing! me: it's a real thing but guys don't care about that. her: lol yes they do, also i wear makeup because i like it not because i want men to like me me: which is true but i can tell you that men like the authentic you. make up everyone knows is a gimmick her: except when i don't wear makeup and then people ask if i'm tired or sick me: why you labeling me with people? if i like what i see i like what i see right? her: yeah i don't think this is going to work. like if you want to date someone who doesn't wear makeup that's fine but that's not me me: what? no one said they had a problem with it. i'm saying i don't have an issue without it either. i'm not really superficial she didn't answer that or a few other messages i sent later. i just don't know if she was over reacting or if i did something wrong tl;dr girl won't talk to me anymore and i want to know who's wrong in this situation	1
jetskiing as a first date on mobile and i'm an engineer so i'm not great with stories, please bear with me. obligatory not today, but just over 2 years ago, less than a week after my boyfriend and i "officially" started dating. i was a few days from turning 18, and i had never been kissed but had been desperately giving him hints that i was ready, trying to patiently wait for him to stop being oblivious but of course, to no avail. so i make a plan. my family lives on a river with a little island in the middle of it, and we have jet skis that i have a license for and my mom encourged me to take them out. so i decided i wanted to bring bf out to the island so we could have a private, romantic date, hopefully ending with a kiss. he overslept and unfortunately arrived late to our date, which i didn't think was that big of a deal, we just got out on the water a little later than planned. it had been super smooth and perfect around the time he was supposed to be there, so obviously i didn't really pay any attention to the fact that it got a bit rougher out there. i had a plan and i was sticking to it. we're slowly moving through the water because we're in a no wake zone for a few minutes, the waves rolling under us, splashing us. finally i see the sign indicating the end of the no wake and i decided to give him a little scare, and pull on the clutch to send the ski zooming. i was clearly an expert jet skier, as i've usually only ridden by myself, not with another passenger behind me, and i definitely misjudged the size of the waves. we hit the first one and bounce over, which sent us crashing straight into a second right behind it, and bf starts sliding but doesn't let go of my, pulling me off the ski with him. i had the safety lanyard strapped to my life vest, we're floating in the water and i spot the ski probably 15 or 20 feet away in the water. no big deal, i've fallen off before, it shuts off when the lanyard gets pulled, i tell bf we just have to swim over to it and get back on, and i promise i'll go a little slower when we get there. i just got a little too excited. so we start swimming towards it, but it seems to be drifting a bit in the other direction. again, no big deal, i'll just swim a little faster. of course, this is the first time i really start to notice how much the wind had picked up, and how the waves are continuing to get more choppy. even swimming at full speed, neither bf or i can make and progress towards it, it's drifting way too fast. bf seems very stressed out by the fact that we're stranded in the middle of the river but i swim over to him and tell him we should just swim back to shore. i've swam in here a hundred times and while we are definitely more than a quarter of a mile off shore in rough conditions, i have no doubts that we can get back, plus we're wearing life jackets! i'm less stressed about being stranded in the river and much more stressed about losing a very expensive jet ski. we're swimming for probably 10 minutes when bf starts insisting we're not making any progress, that the wind and waves are pushing us the opposite way. i argue a bit and convince him to keep trying, although it's obvious he's starting to tire out. of course, i'm kicking myself, on the verge of tears, for putting him through all of this, i'm sure he's terrified having to swim from the middle of a large body of water into shore. he was super sweet tho and kept checking on me and asking if i was alright and would cuddle me while we floated taking breaks. he insisted he was just concerned about my safety and not mad at me, although i wasn't convinced he wouldnt dump me the second we made it to land alive. i found out later bf hadn't eaten anything all day (it was like 3 or 4 in the afternoon), so he was getting exhausted/lightheaded from lack of sustinance. that was a fu on his part lol. it's finally obvious that we're making progress, we just drifted farther down the river from my house, but eventually we make our way out of the water and trek back up the road 10 minutes til we're back at my house. but don't worry, the story doesn't end here. we're soaked with no towels, and we call into the house for my little brother and figure out he's not there. he was the only one to know we went out on the ski in the first place, but we're lucky we got out of the river on our own bc who knows if he was paying any attention to us talking while he was distracted playing videogames. anyways, i know someone has to know where bf and i have been and he is much more skilled on the skis than i am, so i figured he could go on the second one with me and see if we could find the lost ski before my mom finds out about any of this. (side note: my little brother was nearly 16 at the time and 6'3, so i don't want anyone to misinterpret and think i dragged like an 8 year old into the situation or anything lol, he was just a lot more experienced using the skis so i generally went to him for help and questions and stuff) i go to call my little brother, and realize my phone is in the storage of the ski that's off floating somewhere in the middle of the river. so we have no way to contact my little brother, bc the only number i have memorized is my mom's and bf has his phone but he doesn't have my little brothers number. we decided to call a friend of the family, and a friend of bf, and she thankfully answers and texts us little brother's number. we call little brothers and he's out shopping with my aunt who was visiting for the weekend. i explain the situation, and tell him we're going back out on the second ski, and he volunteers to get my aunt to drive along the river road and see if the ski ended up by shore anywhere, since it's a lot faster driving than skiing, especially since the water is getting progressively rougher. bf and i get back on the ski, calmed slightly with the help of little brother and my aunt, and start making our way down the river vveerryyy slowly. of course it was during this time that it started raining on us but we tredged on. when we were swimming, it seemed like the wind was pushing us towards the shore closest to my house, so that's the one we drove along, checking under docks seeing it maybe it washed up near there. we got all the way down to a local bridge, and guessed it wouldn't have gone past there and maybe we missed it, or maybe it's still in the center of the river. bf said he thought the ski drifted to the other shore, across the river, but me being the expert i thought i was, decided that wasn't the case and didn't bother humoring him and checking the other side. (this you'll soon learn was another fu). we turn around and head back towards my house, and bf gets a message from his parents that they're on their way to pick him up (he didn't have a car and they were going somewhere that evening so i didn't have to drive him home). i know his mom is gonna get there way faster than i can get him back to the house, since we're pretty far down the river, so we call little bro again, and have him and my aunt meet us at a random dock. bf gets off the ski, little brother joins me so i'm not on the river alone, and bf gets driven home with my aunt, so his mom doesn't have to wait forever for him. little brother and i decide it's getting too dark and too dangerous to be on the water any longer, and decide i'm just going to have to come clean to my mom that i lost the ski and see what she says about trying to get it back. i figure we haven't heard from her yet, so she's probably not home yet, since usually she'd call and ask where everyone is and what the deal is for dinner. however when we get in sight of my dock 15-20 minutes later, my mom is standing on the end, and bf is still there. i'm really concerned bc bf should've been gone a long time ago, meaning his mom was still waiting for him, and i started getting concerned she might be getting mad at him for not being ready to go. my other concern is that my mom would be furious about losing the ski, and take it out on my poor new boyfriend, who was already kinda intimidated by her, since she can be pretty overbearing and easy to make mad. my little bro and i pull up to the dock, and my little bro is repeating "it wasn't my fault, i didn't do anything" as a mantra in my ear, ready to defend himself from the upcoming storm. my mom helps us up off the ski and gives us big hugs?? she asks us if we're okay and we're like yeah but we lost the ski and she's like it's okay, and of course my brother and i are in shock that we're not grounded for the next century. it turns out, my mom had gotten home from work early that day, and just as she was pulling into the empty driveway, she got a call from my cell phone. it was the county police department, trying to figure out who owned the abandoned ski that ended up on the other side of the river (yes, right where bf told me i should search and i didn't pay any attention). my mom made the connection that i was on the ski with bf, and must've fell off, and thought that we were still stranded in the middle of the river, while it was getting dark, and her mom terror had kicked in until bf and my aunt had pulled in shortly after and explained where i was and that my little brother was with me. she wasn't mad about the jetski bc she was too relieved that i wasn't drowned in the middle of the river or stranded in the dark where i'd get run over by a boat in the middle of the night. also the jetski was apparently insured so if it had gotten damaged, it wasn't a huge deal to get it fixed, which i was not aware of previously. i found out from my boyfriend later that when he was in the car with my aunt, she was telling him about how much i liked him and he better be careful not to play with my feelings and everything bc i had a really big crush on him (my family didn't know we were dating yet, we'd been friends a long time so it wasn't unusual to have him come over and hang out). so that was embarrassing. also when he got back to my house and was approached by my very concerned/intense mom, the first thing she asked him was "did you stay by my baby's side the whole time and make sure she was safe???" and terrified him but of course he said "yes ma'am, i didn't leave her for a moment". not that he really could go anywhere anyways, other than maybe swim away from me my mom and little brother ended up getting back on the ski to go pick up the one from across the river, since it had been successfully located by the officer who had called, and i spent the next several days apologizing to my boyfriend, who thankfully didn't dump me and decide i'm way too much of an idiot for him. i got lectured the next day about looking up the weather and not going out during small craft advisories (which apparently had been in affect when we went out). overall, everything turned out all right, my boyfriend and i are still together, and the ski was totally fine with no damage. however, it still gets brought up much to my embarrassment all. the. time. tl;dr: jetskiied during a small craft advisory with my brand new boyfriend, fell off, lost the ski, had to swim to shore, and tried to find it myself without my mom finding out. the cops found the ski and called her and she thought i was dead in the middle of the river.	1

nearly ending up homeless in london for a night i'm sure this will be my first of many posts on this subreddit as i live a life of impulse decisions which can often lead to catastrophic scenarios. i'm currently in a long distance relationship (spare me the lecture i'm happy) and get to see my so pretty much every other week, we do get to skype every night though. they live quite close to london whereas i'm from the north of england so this costs quite a lot (not least since i'm 17 working class) and often takes a long time so requires getting up at very early hours (totally worth it though). my trains can take between 2:30 - 4:00 depending how cheap i buy them for, since yesterday was her birthday however i checked to see prices and times to go down last night so i can maybe stay in a hotel and see her really early in the morning to surprise her. i found a train far cheaper than my usual going direct from a close station to me getting there very fast and thought why the hell not. the train left 30 minutes from me finding this out with me boarding it. i didn't really have time to pick up much stuff but i got my phone, portable charger, wallet and a clean shirt for what is now today. on the train south, i started looking for hotels that could let me book last second, under the impression they'd let 16+ in on their own as i had heard travelodge used to do. i quickly found out that not only did you have to be 18 to book these hotels but you needed id, something i hadn't picked up and i'm only 17 also. i panicked and started texting friends for suggestions, options were to go to hotels and beg, sleep rough or speak to my so to see if i can stay the night. i couldn't ask to stay at theirs though as this would make me look ridiculously stupid to her and her parents, i'd rather not sleep as a homeless man near london so i tried going to hotels to beg. guess what.... they said no! i found the cheapest place nearby and they found some b&b's for me to call and none would take me being under 18 and without id also. it looked at this point like a park bench was really my place for the night. i asked my so what to do, knowing that if i was to ask to stay over for the first time it would put tremendous pressure on them and their parents, which i'd really like to avoid. after frantic searching we found me a youth hostel in the centre of london that would accept under 18s, i wasn't keen on going invade they turned me down for no id however. i called them up and acted as scared as i could (was pretty scared tbh) and after a long wait and words with the manager i was aloud to stay as long as i had my debit card and student card for identification. i slept in the hostel last night and yet although i'd been given a bedroom to my own as i'm under 18 (containing 2 bunk beds) i awoke at 1:30 to hear sheets moving on the bunk below me, i turn over and see an arm, this freaked me out and i slept very poorly for the rest of the night. i woke up at 5:30 after giving up trying to get decent sleep. this means after the hostel i ended paying far more and getting up around the same time as if i'd just come down this morning instead of last night. i'm not done yet though, as tifu also, i'd agreed to meet with my so at the station one on from where i'd bought the return too as this is considerably closer to their home, i purchased the ticket from the original station to the one closer to their house and then found out my return ticket from the day before i'd bought to get to the hostel was only a day return and not an open one, effectively wasting the ticket i'd literally just purchased and making me have to buy a new one. not only did i waste a lot of money doing this but the ticket machine i was to collect my ticket from (i'll tell you it was at st pancras) refused my card twice so i had to move to another machine to accept my card, if it wasn't for this a guy wouldn't have come up to me begging me for ps2 as that's 'all he needed for his ps9 train to huddersfield). not only did i give him ps2 to make him go away but he then asked the couple directly in front of me for money and if there's a real ps9 train from london to huddersfield someone get me on that train! that's all for the last 24 hours but honestly who knows what else i can get wrong tl;dr nearly ended up homeless for a night because i didn't realise hotels age restrictions, a guy conned me after a disastrous night	1

sibling bonding? this is just a bit of a vent my sisters and i have never got along great. my older sister was out of town for about 2 weeks and i have to say it was the best two weeks of my life. my little sister and i actually bonded a lot when she was gone. now we are two peas in a pod. last night we made dinner together and we were just able to think and do this identically. it was nice when my older sister was gone. also last night my older sister decided to fight with everyone. like everyone. i stayed out of it. my little sister followed suit and decided to be quite. (we are 17 months apart but we look so different ). my mom started calling us two twins and it's kinda funny. my father was a lot happier and upbeat without my sister? he's normally angry and just unhappy so seeing him actually enjoy his time with us was amazing! so idk it feels like my family is falling apart but also was just being put back together.	1

does this means she [22f] likes talking to me [22m] as a friend if she looks for a reason for us to interact? hi! we are officemate and a part of a team on a projects. we used skype as a platform in work for chat conversations. she asked me a particular project task in which i am not much knowledgeable enough to answer it (i only know some parts of it). let's call person a is the one who is more knowledgeable on that project. after a while, she asked me one question i am quite sure of my answer but i when up my desk and ask person a for clarification. but what truly happen is that, she already messaged person a on skype on her project questions in which she did the same thing to me (person a was more knowledgeable on that project). when i went back to my desk to answer her question, she told me its already ok, person a explained it to me already, and said thank you (it was really awkward ) we are newly close friends. from what i conclude, i feel like she likes talking to me as a friend and hence, she looks for a reason to start talking to me. after this thing happen, we still talk normally like friends in work like it was no big deal for both of us. does this means she likes talking to me if she looks for a reason to start a conversation with me? tldr: she asked the same question on person a on a project tasks to me in which person a is much more knowledgable on that project. i asked the same question on person a and before i answer it, she told me that person a already explained it to her. does this means she likes talking to me as she looks for a reason for us to interact?	1
when you think of it, why can you duplicate house keys but not car keys? like at home depot you can go to home depot and be like "can i get a duplicate of this key" they'll be like "sure bruh" but with a car key, it's too small and has too many teeth or something and won't fit in the machine so you need to go to the dealer. this has been in my mind for a while but i never felt like googling it, then this subbreddit showed up and solved my problem	0

i probably have to have (another) surgery and i'm super bummed about it. meh. i was in a horrific car accident and broke 18 (i guess it's 19 now?) bones, 3 surgeries, 2 1/2 weeks in the hospital...it was pretty crazy, l'll share the story if you want. fast forward 3 months, i'm finally allowed to get out of my wheelchair and walk. hurray! ...not so fast. on my third day of walking, my leg muscles were super sore from the sudden use. i went to the gym to use a treadmill to walk out the sore muscles, and the looser my muscles got, the more my foot hurt. drove myself to urgent care as i was pretty sure it was broken in the car accident and the hospital just missed it i was correct; my foot has been broken for 3 months and it was never set properly, so now i'm probably going to require surgery to set the bone. i mean, i wouldn't really care that i broke my foot except that i've been unable to walk for 3 months and i was so excited to get waking/running/lifting/biking/hiking/all the things again. i'm hoping when i go to the orthopedic specialist tomorrow he'll have some other solution, but i'm not holding my breath for that. oh well.	7

should i crawl in a hole and die or...? decided to look up a guy i'm interested in on instagram. i was only curious to see if he had a profile and was hoping if he did, it'd be public. in other words, i was just stalking. don't ask me how it happened, but i somehow accidentally pressed "follow". of course, panic immediately set in but i managed to pressed unfollow within a few seconds. if he has his notifications turned on, which most people do i assume, he would've gotten one saying i wanted to follow him. even though my username doesn't give away my actual name, my profile picture does. i didn't want to change anything because i didn't want to look suspicious in case he looked at my profile right away after having seen the notification and perhaps being curious once he noticed the request was canceled. i'll be seeing him on monday. do i avoid him, say hi and act like nothing happened? we are coworkers and i've only known him a few weeks. we haven't spoken much but i'm afraid this will come off as strange and creepy	1

burning my arse severely hey all! thought i would share a story for you all to enjoy. this was a few years back, i have never spoken about it to anyone outside my close family because i find it extremely embarrassing. please go easy on my grammar and spelling haha! it was a hot summers day, i was left home alone you know as a normal 14 year old. should be able to look after themselves for a few hours. apparently not.... it was roughly lunchtime and i was craving 2 minute noodles (instant noodles for americans) and it came in a packet where you had to put the contents in a bowl and cook them with boiling water. i boiled the kettle and filled the bowl up with hot water but didn't think they were cooked enough, so i put them in the microwave for 2 or so minutes and took them out. i walked over to the couch and was preparing myself to watch a documentary about steve jobs (apple founder) i suddenly realised i had to check something on my computer so i put the bowl aside and went to the next room where the computer was and did what i had to do. i heard the documentary starting so i rushed back and say on the couch. i suddenly feel intense pain and instantly regret what i did, i sat next to the bowl and the momentum from siting down flipped the bowl over, causing the boiling water to burn the right side of my bottom and thigh. i couldn't think. i was in that much pain it wasn't funny, i had no parents to help me, i was all alone and had to figure something out. i had board shorts on which melted to my skin. i thought it was a good idea to rip them off and put ice on the burn (i was little ok i didn't know what in the world to do) ripping off the pants caused to rip my skin off and cause even more pain. i got the phone and didn't want to call my mum, she has a short fuse and doesn't handle stuff well. my dad was more than 2 hours away so i couldn't ring him either. i was fortunate enough to have my aunty living close by at the time. she never answers the house phone but on this one important occasion she did! she asked what had happened and i yelled "ive bunrt my arse and need help" she immediately hung up and was over in 2 minutes. she ran straight in and put me straight into a cold shower for a while. she realised how badly i burnt myself and said i needed to goto the hospital. i had a towel wrapped around me free balling as you do on my way to the hospital. this was extremely embarrassing as both my aunty, her partner and my cousin so both back and front ends of me. we arrived at the hospital where i was given some drugs and they had to re-apply a wet towel for hours until the pain calmed down. my parents both rocked up at the same time and we're both freakin out. the doctors said i had 2nd and 3rd degree burns but was luck enough to get away without a skin graft. they dressed the burn up and sent me home. i didn't sleep at all that night cause my arse was still burning but was just relieved it wasn't as painful as when it occurred. everyday after that incident i had to goto the doctors so they could re-dress the burn and to rip off the scabs that were appearing. that was just about as painful as the burn itself! moral of the story: don't leave your noodles in a place you will forget them and sit on top of them! tl;dr i burnt my arse severely with instant noodles	1

i don't have anyone in my life to brag to, so i'm bragging to you guys! after finishing highschool with a 1.53gpa, i've gotten 100% on everything i've turned in so far this quarter, while working 50-hour weeks! i don't really have anyone to tell, i'm keeping it secret from my family that i'm in school, and to tell anyone else just feels like bragging. months ago some fine folks over at /r/personalfinance really helped me figure out how i was going to make this work. today we were handed back a quiz, where the average score was 64%. i shoved it in my bag immediately so nobody would see, but smiled the entire drive home. some version of this has happened almost every class so far. i've haven't done well academically in my entire life, and i doubt my instructors have any idea how much this means to me. i graduated hs 3 years ago, and always assumed college would be 'too hard' for me. after years of just grinding away at work that lead me no where, it feels amazing to have direction in my life once more. anyway i love you all and hope youre all having good nights or days!!!!	3

tifu by asking my dad if i could watch "sunny leone" okay, so this wasn't actually today and i've posted this before but i deleted it because formatting, spelling, terminology and the resulting cringe. so one day while i was in the ninth grade i fucked up. i was watching my one of my favourite youtubers; (his name is jusreign) he's an indian guy talking about indian people and i'm from south asia as well so it was freaking hilarious. expectedly bollywood topics came into the video. one of which was a spoof of a guy named [sunny deol](<url>) . i hadn't watched much bollywood at the time but i knew a lot of my indian friends had. the way sunny deol was portrayed made him seem like a fighter, and i have an incredible weak spot for fighting movies so i wanted to watch one of this films. at one point i'm talking to my dad (also indian, feel free to think of a stereotype at this point) about stuff i want to do. i tell him i want to get into watching bollywood and people like *sunny deol*... cue him turning a nerve-racking shade of serious and give me a lecture about how the internet is full of a lot of distracting shit that i don't need in my life. innocent little me was sitting there taking it all in wondering... how could [this guy](<url>) possibly be dangerous to my well being?? fast forward two years and i'm still wondering why. cue me finding out who [this is](<url>), sunny *leone* (hey, that kinda sounds like deol doesn't it ); she's a famous bollywood actor, model, former porn star... wait what? yup, it was at that moment that i had realized i had taken lecture after lecture from my dad about internet safety because i had walked up to him and said "i wanna watch porn"! -_- u/sghmk123 you fucking idiot.	10

i [21f] am feeling suffocated by my friend's [20f] constant talk about her abuse. my friend and i have both experienced child abuse. i no longer live with my abuser and am in the process of recovery by going to therapy and putting distance between us. my friend does still live with her abuser and is not doing anything for healing. our trauma was something we bonded over in the beginning of our friendship. it was the first time either of us were able to talk openly about it, which was very helpful. i stopped talking about it after a month or two, but was always ok with listening to my friend vent when she needed to. i always offer her advice and try to help her through it when something is going on. more often than not she doesn't take the advice but that's understandable considering her situation. over time though, it's become harder and harder to listen to her talk about it. it's frustrating to hear her complain about the same thing, ignore any advice, and make choices that actively hurt her. i hate to listen to her talk about her abuse and abuser also, because it's very similar to mine. for a while it was the only thing she talked about-every day she would go "so guess what my dad said to me last night..." sometimes she would send me screenshots of their conversations with no caption. i would try to comfort her and she would respond, literally, with "..." and i wouldn't know what to say. i stopped responding to those kinds of texts after a while. it was triggering for me to read, especially when i was dealing with the rough parts of my own therapy. i told her it was stressful for me to hear about her dad. occasionally she would realize it was bothering me and send me guilty messages about what a bad friend she was, and then i would have to comfort her again. admitting that she had upset me made her shut down. the other day i forgot to reply to one of her messages about her dad and she started posting about "when people ignore your messages" on her social media. i saw the story and responded to her message, and she replied with a screenshot of my view on her story. i apologized and told her why i don't respond right away to those messages and she said she was kidding, then updated her story with "got em". i felt so manipulated and stopped texting her. i feel like over time she's just getting worse about it, and i'm losing my patience more. i don't want to cut this off completely, she's like a sister to me and i know i'm the only one that she can talk to about this (besides a therapist ). we're rooming together next year and i don't want things to be uncomfortable, but this has to stop. what do i tell her? tl;dr: my friend's constant talk about her abusive parent is stressing me out and getting in the way of my own healing and our friendship. how do i get her to tone it back?	11

powerlifting has boosted my self confidence i gained about 30 lbs in college and while i was still a mild athlete, the confidence levels lowered. i starting weightlifting a year ago and actively powerlifting 8 months ago. i'm getting stronger. i have a coach and everything is really making a difference. i used to have a lean body with mostly muscle. now i feel stronger than i did before even though i weigh more. i feel good and it's honestly helped me more than i thought it would. i always look forward to weightlifting! it's so meditative and i can focus on me. i want to hear positive stories right! what's something good that's happening in your life? doesn't have to be related at all. i'm just feeling extremely happy	3
things keep getting worse even when they're getting better. as a foreword, please if you can help it do not attack me. do not gang up on me. i know i was a piece of shit. i know that i'm not deserving. i've put in the work, i've been to therapy on my own accord. i've taken accountability for my actions and i've lived with regret and remorse every day for the past year plus. my wife and i have been married a bit over 7 years, and been through a lot of shit. mostly it's my shit, but neither of us are perfect. i've been through an abusive childhood, emotionally and physically. i had a bad temper and my moms way of dealing with it was to throw me into an ice cold shower, or use emotional abuse. i never learnt how to deal with my emotions properly. i've dealt with drinking and anger problems. i've damaged our possessions though i've never been physically abusive. i've done a lot of damage to my relationship in my drunken moments. i've said things i don't mean. my defense mechanism was always the kill shot. if i was being attacked rather than saying i can't handle this right now i would attack an insecurity, and i've done that a few times. around the time she became pregnant i had no sex drive due to my job. every single day i was being screamed at and threatened to be fired. i was sworn at all day to the point i had health issues and she never understood why i didn't want to go to work. eventually we conceived (yay! ), but i did not handle the stress of early fatherhood well. this led to us never fixing our issues, but sweeping them under the rug. i was replaced, her mental and emotional focus was elsewhere 24/7. i don't blame her. fast forward 3 years. i had mentioned how lonely i was many times over the years and was always to be met with "go find what you need somewhere else". eventually i started talking with someone, a lot. we talked all the time. i felt good again, like i mattered. our conversations were always pretty wholesome, so i convinced myself it wasn't cheating. i confided a lot of things i shouldn't have but honestly had i not hidden this relationship it would have been very acceptable, despite random odd compliments back and forth. again i take full accountability for seeking that over trying harder to rebuild my marriage. eventually my wife discovered what was going on and was rightfully very hurt. since then i've gone full mental breakdown. i've accused her of cheating. i've asked her to let me go through her phone, i literally had a mental breakdown over the stress of this, at which point i decided on my own to go to therapy. she found out over a year ago and she still tells me she's not over what i've done. i've been through therapy, i've begun feeling normal again, we have had lots of real fun together the past couple months. lots of laughs, and just lots of what i remember our early relationship being like. like i said, things have been really good. we've been talking about buying a place together (it's super expensive to own here) and i don't think she would entertain that unless she saw a future with me as she's very independent. but then today she got a a little bit of bad news from family and she's been drinking. i've tried to be supportive but it hasn't been received all that well (okay i get it), but we got into a discussion about anti-vaxxers due to a show we're watching and she literally said "like you, you form your political opinions based on a single facebook video" in response to me speaking out on anti-vaxxing. i felt like i got punched in the chest, to have her think i'm so wishy washy and mentally feeble, which is totally not true i do so much research when i believe in something. when i believe in something i do the research and she knows that. i feel like she's using me as her punching bag and i don't think she respects me at all.. the only thing i want in this world is for this to work. but what do i do? do i keep crawling through the trenches or do i let her go? she hates me and loves me at the same time. i'm at a loss. i want us both to be happy. tl;dr - i had an emotional affair, things are mostly good at this point, but i think my wife doesn't respect me despite all the work i put in. i'm genuinely remorseful. i've been honest. what do i do?	8

some please help me so to start things off. hi i'm aidan and i'm 16, i have a girlfriend of 6 months. we met for the first time about a year ago. she lives in the middle east. i know people say that online dating doesn't work, but her and i genuinely believe that we belong together. the first time we talked her parents found out and she got in a boatload of trouble. i recently contacted her because i couldn't live without her. since that day in march everything has been going smoothly until today. we were playing among us just laughing it up in a facetime call. then her sister came in the room and caught us. she said that her and i won't be able to talk for the next week just to be safe so we don't get split up again like last time. i'm worried that i won't be able to talk to her again. the amount of fear that i felt when she said the words "we got caught" is unexplainable. i need some advice on what to do to not be so paranoid and scared. if someone could please help me i would be very grateful.	2

ex boyfriend is now able to think about future since breakup? my boyfriend (24m) and i (20f) broke up a little more than a week ago because of long distance. we love each other but we saw this relationship as a dead end because we weren't sure how we'd make it work soon without the distance (he's in italy & i'm in america). i always wanted to talk about the future with him... when we met 2 years ago, we both wanted to move to australia. it was realistic for both of us because i could go as an australian (dual citizenship) and he could go with a working holiday visa. after leaving europe a month ago, i really wanted to start planning our future so we could live closer to each other and live in a new environment. he told me he wasn't able to think about the future because it doesn't seem possible for him... he has commitments in italy. i thought we could do it in a year or so, and make it happen. this is one of the reasons we broke up, because he wasn't able to think about the future and i was (also willing to continue long distance until then). anyways we broke up, and i still love him a lit & respect his reasoning for not wanting to continue this relationship. i can say i was really torn over the decision and cried a lot. he knew i was having a really hard time because we talked every day after the breakup ( ). he thinks we should continue talking to make it easier. we were messaging today and i told him how i am still considering moving to australia. he then replied how he wants to start thinking about his future and moving away from home in a year. i was really hurt reading this because it seemed that now that we are broken up, he is suddenly able to think about the future. what are your thoughts? thank you tl;dr: basically my ex boyfriend has said he wants to start thinking about his future but told me he wasn't able to think about the future when we were together	9

my prospective roommates bailed on me, does anyone have any stories to help me feel better? i was talking to some girls via a roommate finder group on facebook and i'd gone through so many people and nothing had really been in my price range or a good fit... then i was finally messaging with a girl and everything was going really well (so i thought) and then she started a group chat with me and another girl and they asked if i was serious about joining them. i said yes (and turned down a couple other people) and so i thought everything was planned. i just messaged to check in and they told me they found someone else and they were going with her instead. i'm just really so incredibly sad and hurt about it. i'm supposed to be moving in like three weeks and now i don't actually have anywhere to live and i'm starting to panic. i just needed to get this off my chest. i'm just so sad and hopeless now. i was so excited, they seemed really nice...	14

coming clean. i am here because i saw that my sister had posted something about me to this subreddit (i will not show her name to keep her anonymous), and it was a rant about me. i read through it and saw the things people had to say about it, and was humbled. i wanted to say that i am sorry. some of the things she said were: i am making fun of her stuff and getting offended when she makes fun of my stuff. quoting and singing wap; making her uncomfortable blaming her for things being a dick in general. i just want to let everyone know about this and 'come clean' to what i have been doing. discussion in the comments is entirely open so say whatever you want. i am so sorry for what i have done, and i really do feel bad. i am her older brother by 2 years so i should be the one to set a good example and treat her with the respect and kindness that she deserves. she is my sister and the things i am doing/saying are not respecting that. i am sorry for what i have done, and i am going to work hard on changing it. thank you for reading	3

extremely resentful for childhood and mom i don't like to sound whiny but i'm really resentful for my childhood. i see my peers from school graduating from 4 year universities, and doing great things. i can't help but feel constantly that that should have been me. i grew up really really poor. i didn't pay attention to these things when i was a kid, because i was a kid. i didn't know anything about stuff like this, and actually thought it was normal, but now that as an adult looking back, i really feel like i got the short end of the stick. 1. my living situation wasn't all that great. i lived in the same house from the time i was 2 to around the 7th grade with my mom, 3 aunt's, and 3 cousins. the house was literally falling apart. there were broken windows, terrible mice, the downstairs bathroom reguarly flooded with sewer water from the tub, which had to be wet vacuumed and taken outside by the kids. ( i usually had to do it) the roof above my room constantly leaked for years, causing mold to grow, leaving me to sleep on the couch for the rest of my years there (i never got a bed). there were pidgeons living in the attic, which created a terrible smell in the summer. the house also constantly stayed filthy all the time. 2. loneliness also played a big part of this. i almost always never had any friends, and most of the time played by myself. i often think of the "friends" i clinged to at school just felt sorry for me. i didn't really connect with my cousins most of the time they would all pick on me. (fighting me, breaking my toys, doing things that would intentionally make me sad) 3. i want to believe wholeheartedly that my mom did everything she could to provide me a good life, but sadly i can't go on believing that anymore. she never washed my clothes to the point that i just thought that's how everyone lives. i started to try to wash my own clothes in the upstairs bathtub because after a while, i realized i was the stinky kid at school, and people were talking about me. i never really even got new clothes. i remember myself having to "sew" (didn't know how really just did something to close it up) the crotch of my navy blue school uniform pants with bright orange thread because i didn't have any other option. i never really had nice shoes. my shoes were always old and i probably only got one pair a year. i really feel like she should have provided for me more. how did she not see the way my clothes, or shoes, or even hair was looking when she was around. she always had cigarettes and things for herself though. these things in my opinion caused me to be extensively bullied from 2nd grade through high school. 4. i also didn't get a really good education. my mom wasn't all that patient when helping with math homework (1st-4th grade maybe) i clearly remember her getting frustrated when i kept getting the answers wrong, and instead of further helping me she resorted to beating me with the tv remote when i got the answer wrong. so it wasn't like i was actually doing it to learn, it was just not to get hit again. the teachers in school weren't really a help either. i remember vividly not being able to get the right answer in math again and the teacher (1st-2nd grade same teacher) yelled at me, causing me to cry in front of the class. theres also a part of me that believes those events (and many more) caused me to have some kind of mental disconnect from math because i never learned it. it's hard for me to do simple addition and subtraction without counting on my fingers or using a calculator, and you can just forget about multiplication and division. i just can't learn it. i've tried extensively throughout my teens and adult years. i know i needed a tutor but i never got one. despite not getting a good education, my mom still pressured me really hard to go to college. internally i knew i wouldn't be able to because i'm lacking fundamental skills. so i tried to pick something easy that i knew i could probably do with my skills. i ended up choosing culinary arts. i thought my mom was supportive of my choice because surely she knows deep down inside her heart that i'm not that smart, but she ended up taking me to a meeting arranged by a successful friend of hers, with some person that worked for the mayor, on the reasons i should not persue my dream of being a cook or chef. for the record though i listened to my heart for once, and went for my dream. i did the culinary arts program and graduated from a community college, earning an associate's degree. i never was able to find a job though so i had to start working a dead end job to support myself. i hate feeling these things and i wish i was 100% happy but i'm not. i wish i could just tell my mom how i feel, but we never had an open relationship to the point that i could tell her things. i actually used to hold off on saying things, or just thinking in my head on how i could just blurt it out. she used to get really mad and yell at me all the time when i told her stuff. or i'd start to say something but get scared, or just not want to say, and she'd force me to tell her, even threatening to hit me with the belt if i didn't. i realize that i may need therapy to deal with my terrible life, but i just don't think i can afford to do those types of things with the job that i work. tldr: i feel like my mom should have done more for me when i was young. she really dropped the ball and i'm still suffering today. i feel like i'm too poor to get professional help.	2

i got two compliments about my (m, 48) new hair style from two separate cute interns at work. i've had short-cropped hair and a clean shave for nearly 20 years, but i began growing it out this year and added a salt and pepper beard to the mix for a more casual, less quasi-law enforcement look. it finally got long enough to push back into a decent-quality longer, gentle part that i can casually push back with my hand throughout the day. it only requires a little styling clay to accomplish, and i think it looks great. on two separate occasions at work yesterday, cute twenty-something interns (f) made it a point to say i looked really good. i don't lack confidence, but for a guy nearing 50, those compliments are rare. it sure was a great moment for the ego i misplaced a few years back, and has me inspired to pick up the fitness routine to match the better hair situation. still almost kinda got some swagger left, i guess. sorta. whatever, i'll take it. 🏻	18

please stop faking mental illness. i'm so sorry that you are in such desperate need of attention that you need to resort to that, but please, stop faking mental illness. it hurts me to see people say they have crippling anxiety because they're scared to speak in public, or that they have depression because they're sad. if only you knew how awful and draining it really is and how offensive it is to fake mental illness	3

i just had my heart broken, and i feel hopeless i was just dumped by my girlfriend the other night, and i don't know what to do. "i can't really say i'm in love with you" is what she said. this just came out of nowhere and i feel like i can't breathe. just a couple of days ago i thought we were still madly in love, now i'm heartbroken and i feel like i'm going to have a nervous breakdown. i just wish i knew what went wrong. i wish she would tell me that i did something wrong, tell me that i fucked up, tell me i had abhorrent personality traits, at least then i could make some sense of it. but she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. she likes me, and cares about me, but she's not in love with me anymore. how am i supposed to react to that? how can you say you love me on sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on friday? she keeps insisting that i didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am i supposed to understand that? i'm just hurt and confused. she stopped by my house the other night to return some things i left in her apartment, my shirt she had (and it still smells like her ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents i gave her for valentines this year. i don't know what i'm gonna do. i spent all night crying, i feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. it's like i'm trapped in a nightmare i can't wake up from. whenever i was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. despite all the bullshit i deal with on a daily basis, i always felt alright, because i knew that no matter what happened i had her beside me, and she made everything alright. i honestly don't know how i'm gonna make it through winter without her. our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and i was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. but when dumping me she was just so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. we were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to react. she said she doesn't see us having a future together; i saw us potentially getting married one day, i definitely saw a future with her. and she used to see one with me, i just don't know what changed. i don't know how to deal with this. without her i just feel dead inside. just last week i was so happy, now i don't know how i'm gonna live without her. she was the best thing that ever happened to me, now i feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. she said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. i don't think i could ever find anyone else as amazing as her. the only one i feel like i can turn to at this moment is my best friend. they try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but i'm a crying mess right now, and i don't feel ready to try to date again; but they are making me go back to online dating and i don't really feel strong enough to object right now. i've never felt this hurt and empty. i don't know how i'm supposed to make it through this.	14

my parents are protective over my phone and what i do on it. so i just started high school (m14) and my parents won't let me keep my phone upstairs at night, or during the day. they think that i am going to watch pornography, which i don't, get sent nudes/send nudes, which i don't and i will never get sent, or they think i'm gonna get "exposed" to things i don't need to see on insta or reddit for instance. i know about these things because i am different than i am at home. i know about all these things because well i'm in high school. ive tried to convince them but they won't budge. all of my friends don't have this rule and i try and tell them that. any help convincing? thanks	18

finding 5 months old chicken in my oven background: i'm a student from a fairly well-off family, grew up with 1 maid cleaning everything around the house, cooking etc. so the whole student life & living alone is totally new to me. so my grandma visited me in january, she obviously cooked everyday and cleaned up. on her last day she made me chicken in the oven. that weekend i went to a friend of mine at the other side of the town so i totally forgot about it. coming up today i found a bag of chicken seasonal so i went and bought some chicken wings. instructions:open the paper bag place your chicken inside, season them and put the bag on top of an oven dish. i open my oven door for the first time as a student and the smell... have you ever smelled a dead cat? x3... i open the pot's lid and the only thing i see is a black greasy mess, puked 3 times & i feel sick as f. needless to say i threw the pot and thinking of throwing the oven as well if the smell doesn't go away in the next hours.it's sunday so i can't find any cleaning lady . just order uber eats, can't bring myself to go to the kitchen again. got a picture of the food for the braver ones tldr: forgot chicken in the oven for 5 months and found it today	4

should i give it a shot hey fellow teens, i know alot of us have been in relationships and have had feelings for others. right now id appreciate some advice on my situation so the sit rep is that lately i've been feeling kind of down as i've been missing this girl (lets call her dora) i was seeing and going out with for a period of time. me (ill call myself diego) and dora were classmates in a class together earlier this year. we met and began talking together and hit off. we were going out for a while. our first two dates went pretty great as we discovered that have similar interests and music tastes. we would talk quite a bit about ourselves and each other when went out then. after those dates we still went out (probably another 3 times) but i started to become shy and talk less as i really didn't know what to or say since i've never had gotten that far with anyone before. on our last date she brought up that fact and said that i haven't been contributing as much as i should and that im quieter than what i use to be. i told her and was honest with her because i was nervous as ive never been with anyone before or had gotten this far. she said she understood and later that day told me that maybe we should just be friends and how we shouldn't have a label or anything as she was surprised as how fast everything was going. we talked on and off for a few weeks. then i decided to hit her up after two weeks after not talking. and asked her if she wanted to do something. she asked me why i wanted to hang out all of a sudden. following conversation her: why do you want to hang out all of a sudden? me: cause i felt like i was ignoring you. which im not trying to. her: when did i ask to hang out? (not meant to sound rude) my dumbass: idk probably a while back. idk how to really answer that her: i never asked you to hang out , again not meant to sound rude me: that hurt, the emoji didnt help either her: sorry, but i didnt ask you you asked me? me: i did ask you, i mean i asked you today if you would want to hangout her: then why did you say i asked you to hangout, i dont think i can hang out today my stupid ass: that's alright, i really just wanted to do something instead of sitting at hone and asked if you were interested in doing something her: wow okay me: you dont sound to happy bout that, the ignoring stuff is true (honestly right here and my prior response were i messed up as im saying that all the other stuff was bullshit. the really reason i wanted to hang out was to talk/see her in person to see what she thought had to change for us to give it a go to make it work) her: i could careless if you were ignoring me, you never put in any effort anyways, at least it didn't seem like it me: im gonna go on a limb and say that's probably because i was so quiet and never really said anything when i was with or around you her: im not blaming you in anyway im just saying why it ended before it became something me: sorry if this isn't what you wanted your night to be like, but i guess i just really wanted to talk to you. what im getting from you is that you thought that i wasnt putting in much effort as you wanted or thought i should. so you thought it would be better if we move on her: you cant take this the wrong way but it was just boring, cause it seemed like i did all the majority of the talking and you seemed like you were kind if insecure and didnt know what to say or do, again dont take this the wrong way i was just stating something me: i agree too i felt like i didnt know what to do. as i felt like what ever i did was gonna fuck it up so after that we had small but minimum contact but not like actual conversations with each other. since november (when the previous conversation happened) i've taken the time to think about what i had to improve and overcome about myself to gain self confidence. like i said before me and her started out great in the beginning as i saw her as a friend and we talked and interacted regularly. i'd like to go get back to that state and see where we would go from there. ik i cant just text her and say do you want to give a relationship a second chance? that would definitely be no. so ive been thinking and asked some of my friends and hers if texting her and just having small talk to rebuild our friendship and eventually see where we go after that. they mostly agreed saying that would be the best course of action. any input or ideas are greatly appreciated on what to do or say. kind of have a plan already but want to see what you guys think? give it a shot or just move on?	1

my (16m) girlfriend's(16f) strict dad recently found out about us dating and forced us to breakup and i need some hope. me and my girlfriend, who is also my bestfriend, have been together for a year and two months, and you can call me young and naive but i really do love her with every ounce of my heart and losing her feels like losing my other half. i've clicked with her like no other girl before and our relationship is one of the most healthy, caring, fun, and compatible relationships you'll ever find. her personality is almost as beautiful as she looks and she's one of the smartest people you'll ever meet with an extremely solid future ahead of her, not to mention she's talented as hell. she's wifey material up and down and my own parents understand how good our relationship is and love her lots. while all this is great for me, at home for her can be hell. she has an extremely strict dad and she only got her first phone a few months ago, and even then her dad has an app that monitors everything she does. he has a strict policy about not dating until she's 16 and he has to approve of the boyfriend before they can actually date. we talk via discord most of the time and long story short, her dad walked in and her computer froze as she tried to close it. in his words, she "got busted". he found out about everything and is doing the worst to punish her. at this point there's nothing we can do and out of respect of her dad, we stopped seeing each other as much as it hurt and as heartbroken as we felt. she cried and cried everyday and her dad has done nothing short to remind her how she fucked up and to mention how she's a whore/slut/bitch/fucker. the step-mom is the same way. (stepmom is asian and the dad is black, what a combo for good parenting amirite?) anyways, things are really rough right now and she gave me her drawing book that doubled as a diary and going through it broke my heart. it was supposed to be a christmas gift or a two year gift so it'd be filled up and she hoped we could look back on it together and travel back in time with some of the things. so i'm asking for any advice on what i should do. he also thinks i have nudes of her (which i don't) and i'm going to expose her so he's threatening to press charges, so if that doesn't give you an idea of the kind of person he is and the horribly-wrong impression he has about me then idk what will. i'm also wondering if any of you guys have experienced a situation like this and how it turned out, or if you know anyone who went through something like this. i just need something to look at as hope and think me and her could turn out the same way. my friend's parents went through a similar situation and are happily married today, though i feel like the story about that was skewed so that my buddy could make me feel better. idk and please, i don't need any advice telling me to move on. thanks ppl tl;dr: me and my girlfriend were forced to break up after a year and two months of the healthiest relationship ever and i'd like to hear some stories about people in the same situation and coming out with a happy ending.	3

my "no u" moment i remember when i was around 6 or 7 years old. we had cousins that cussed like sailors but my siblings and i didn't. we didn't even say hell (we'd say heck lol) any way, i remember arguing with my cousin about something and he called me an asshole. the response i gave was "no you're the one!" even at that age, right after i said that i remember thinking to myself how stupid that sounded.	1
my friend's boyfriend (30m) is jealous and posse6keeps forcing her (20sf) to break plans with me (20sf) so my friend rachel* and i have been friends for about six months now. we get along great and we have a lot in common and have the best time together. when i first met rachel, she was having a hard time with her boyfriend, danny* and she told me that she's happy to have me to hang out with, because danny never wants to go anywhere. after a few weeks, she invites me over for dinner one night and when i get there, she and danny are arguing about groceries and the house. she had the house cleaned and he messed it up and wouldn't clean up after himself. i just awkwardly sat on the couch and petted the cats while they argued. finally, she came back into the living room and apologized for that, and we decided to watch a movie. danny kept popping in every two minutes and continued to egg her on about where the groceries should go, and she kept getting up to do whatever he complained about. the night was very awkward and uncomfortable. i left and haven't been back to her house since. danny is a very whiny person and i really, really dislike him. i'm cordial with him, but i've stopped going to her house because of him. i've strictly decided to hang out with rachel only if danny isn't involved in our plans. i haven't actually told her this, but i'm considering it. rachel and danny recently got in a huge fight where he called her something really horrible and she called me crying, so that night i took her out for dinner and drinks to make her feel better. she went in further depth about her relationship and how she sometimes feels trapped with him because she is financially dependent on him and how he is overbearing and possessive. i told her that she should cut it off, because she's been with him for 3 years and he's only gotten worse and she said that she was considering it. i told her if she needed anything to let me know, and if she had to move out unexpectedly, i'd help her. she thanked me for everything and then she went home. she's decided to work things out with him, only i know deep down that she just feels trapped and her family is encouraging her to stay with him. one day, she told me that we should save $20 a week to have a girls night out every weekend and i agreed. we planned one this week and when the day came, she cancelled because she said that danny just found out his office is closing in 2 years and he's upset about it and that she needed to stay home to console him. danny hates his job and has tried to leave it for something else for a while now... he just had an interview last week. i told her not to worry, that two years is plenty of clearance to find something new but if she had to stay home then ok. i was really mad. i didn't let her know that. why would a grown ass man be so upset that he demands to be coddled and make his gf stay home? my mother has a similar relationship with my father. in fact, this is almost parallel to that. my mom is always canceling plans because my dad throws fits if he's not invited. cut to the next day, we postponed our lunch to have that day. i text her that i'm in town and i can pick her up. no answer. i text her again 20 minutes later. no answer. i call her. no answer. i eventually give up and go home, letting her know that i was disappointed she wasn't coming. she texts me that night saying that she was so sorry, she and danny were running errands together all day and he need some help with his resume. i suggested lunch for today and she said she'd have to ask if that was ok with danny. i said don't worry about it and have ignored her texts since then. i feel like crap. i know that she is not falling out on purpose, because she is a very genuinely person. i know this is all 100% danny and his needy ass. i'm so tired of it. a month ago, i invited her to go see a movie and bought our tickets and we agreed to meet at the theater. a day later, she sheepishly tells me that danny really wants to go, and if i wouldn't mind buying his ticket and that they'd pay me back on payday. i felt kind of cornered but agreed. movie day came, didn't see them anywhere. give up looking for them and grab my seat. i text her asking if they're here and no reply. 20 minutes after the movie starts, they shuffle in the theater. i was pissed. not only did this man invite himself and crash our plans, i had to pay for his ticket, they came in late, and he never thanked me. come to find out, he forced her to include him in the plans and the reason they were late was because he was mad and they were fighting. i've told her time and time again that this guy is a toxic man child and she agrees but never goes through leaving him. my patience is running out and at this point, i just feel hurt and angry. i don't want to cut off our friendship because if she needs me, especially if they break up, i want to be there for her. i don't know if i should have a talk with her about this or just keep her at arms length. either way, i feel like crap. i'm angry at both of them, but i also know that she's vulnerable and relies on him for everything, so i understand why she prioritizes him first, but i'm really sick of this man. if he wasn't in the picture, rachel and i wouldn't have any problems. tl;dr my friend's boyfriend is incredibly possessive and starts fights if she wants to have girls night plans with me. he keeps forcing her cancel and i'm so sick of it. i'm not sure how to handle it but i don't want to stop being friends because of it.	11

how can i get my (f23) partner (m26) to brush his teeth without being naggy? okay so i love this guy to bits, we're engaged, our relationship is great. please don't tell me to break up with him, i know what you guys are like i just really want him to brush his teeth twice a day. his breath isn't even an issue, i'm just worried about his long term oral health. i don't want him to have to plop his teeth in a glass of water at bedtime when he's 50 (like his dad does). before we lived together, he only brushed his teeth once every *few days*. now, i make sure he does them in the evening at the same time as i do mine. but he won't do them in the morning before work because "i don't have time, don't nag me." basically, he won't do them unless i'm standing next to him, asking him to do it. and on weekday mornings, even that doesn't work. we are usually in a rush in the morning, but still. i manage to fit it in. once i really didn't have time, so i just took my toothbrush to work and did it there. i don't think "not enough time" is a good excuse, but nagging is getting me nowhere. his teeth are already a pretty grubby colour from years of smoking and i really don't want my husband to have gross gappy teeth. any advice? tl;dr: my fiance doesn't brush his teeth unless i nag him. how can i get him to do it of his own accord?	11
i [30m] feel torn as i want to contact my ex[28f] as i would like to have a friendship with her but petrified of rejection. as the title says, i'm a little torn because i don't think i have the balls to reach out to her. i would like to have a friendship with her, it's been 9 months since we split, we had a pretty messy relationship towards the end, but the good times were amazing and we had a really good connection, more than i've ever had with anyone else but when the bad times came around they were seriously bad. we were major dicks to each other and it turned pretty toxic by the end, but i've come to terms with a lot of things and having her as an intimate partner, but what i'm really struggling with is the idea that i've lost her as a best friend. i talk to all my other ex's and we're just really good friends and i would like to also have that kind of relationship with her, but the only difference is that my ex's have contacted me, and i'm so happy they did. but i'm petrified of rejection, i'm also petrified to have my messages that i would send to her screen captured by her and shared with her friends and sisters, which she would do a lot in our relationship and it would upset me a lot as i felt there was no privacy when ever we had an issue. i just need some advise whether to just do it and face the outcome or just leave it and not bother. all opinions are welcome :) and thank you for taking the time to respond tldr: need to find the courage to text my ex to have a friendship but scared of rejection sorry had to delete it due to removed, fingers crossed i've set it right now.	3
i [23 m] went on a date with a woman [22 f]. i enjoyed myself, but i'm not sure if she did. we met on tinder and clicked. i asked her out after a couple of days of texting and we scheduled a date for the weekend. i felt like the date went really well, and she told me she did too! we laughed, had good conversation, we even went back to her place and cuddled, watched movies, made out, and i stayed the night. the following morning we had sex and afterwards she made breakfast for us. she dropped me off at my place and told me that she enjoyed herself and that i'm someone that she enjoys being around and talking to, and i told her likewise. we kissed and went our separate ways. a few hours later (yeah it might seem a bit desperate i know), i texted her and said that i had fun and that we should definitely get together again. she agreed with a emoji so i know it's real lol. and i told her i'd let her know when i'm free and after that the communication stopped. we had previously texted every day about all kinds of stuff, so the sudden drop off of communication has maybe got me concerned that she didn't really have a good time with me? combine that with the fact that she added 2 new photos of herself to her tinder profile last night has just got me feeling really insecure and that she isn't really feeling me after all. i don't want this to just be a one night stand because she's someone that i could definitely see myself with. i just don't know how to proceed to do this. does anyone have some advice for me? tl;dr: help me figure out where i stand with this girl?	6

am i in bois? so this girl who i've been friends with for like 8 years and secretly had a crush on, has been changing lately. she started to talk more often, told me personal stuff, added me to her private story, and let me follow her finsta. she has also been a little more smiley, always send selfies, and she had me over on the fourth of july. at her party, we went in her hot tub. she wanted to sit close next to me and we just talked for a while. later that might, we went to see fireworks and she sat very close next to me and rested her head on my shoulder. after that, we went to my house for more fireworks and she held me hand. she was taking lots of selfies with her face up against mine and sending it to all her friends. two days ago, her friend started texting me asking how i felt about her and i was honest. she was like "omg" and "yay" but idk how she knew. she went on vacation yesterday and has been snapping me nonstop. and just 20 minutes ago, i was sent a bunch of selfies and at the end, she said "goodnight ", which she never sends me that. when i responded with the same thing back, she sent me a hand-drawn heart. i'm planning on taking her to an amazing park soon when she returns. am i in? can someone help?	3
i need a bit of advice alright, so there's this girl i like in my college. never talked to her before, but she knows i exist. i did some digging, and found her insta profile. i followed her. a moment later, she didn't accept my follow request but she sent a follow request. i accepted it. some time later, she unfollowed me, and deleted my request. any idea what would've happened, and what i should do if i like her?	11

i'm not so stressed anymore! this school year has been very tough for me, because i've started in a program called runningstart. some of you may know what that is but i'll just explain it a bit anyway: when you become a junior in high school(or senior if you start it a year late) you can do a program called runningstart. this program gives you classes at your local college that are college level and give you both college and high school credit. it's been a tough year going into a new situation and having harder classes. i finally finished all my finals (3 for the 3 classes i have). i'm so grateful for the people around me and especially reddit to get me through it, as well as those boring classes	8

i (21f) might like my friends roommate (20m) and i don't know what to do for stories sake, let's call my friend chris and his roommate luke. so me and chris have been friends since freshman year of college, we are seniors now, and recently he became friends with luke. well chris and luke are roommates now, and i have also started to become friends with luke, although we never really hang without chris and others also being there. chris and i have been friends through a lot, through both of our crazy exes and the coming and going of mutual friends, and chris has also stated that he liked me and he has asked me out. now, chris is not really my romantic type, and i have very blatantly expressed that i am not interested and we are just friends, and he is okay with this, we are still very good friends to this day. however, luke has very recently started to message me outside of our big group chat, and started asking to hang out, just us. we actually went and saw a movie together, that we both really wanted to see, so i said why not. i'm starting to get the feeling he is interested (hopefully i'm not reaching at this) and if he is, i'm not quite sure how i feel about it. luke is a very nice guy, and we have a lot of the same interests, we are even the same major. but i'll be graduating the end of this year, and he still has 2 years left. also, i worry it will be awkward with chris. on another note, i haven't had the best past with dating, and it makes me super nervous, cause i know that i am a lot sometimes and can take a while to get used to. i've always been the type of person that if i'm on the fence, just try it out. but i'm not quite sure what i want right now. is this something i should pursue? should i wait until he specifically asks me to address it? help. (sorry for the ramble ) tl;dr - should i date my friends roommate? or would that be weird?	12

i feel so depressed, giving up one person i hit up this girl about 6months ago, who was an ex of mine from high school. we talked, hung out but she never mentioned her boyfriend. (of course i knew she had one) until one day they had a fight and she was like my bf..blah blah blah and i was like ooh you have a bf?! fast forward a couple of months and we are now hanging out all afternoon monday thru friday for the next two months. we were basically fuck buddies or fwbs i guess. we wouldnt really talk sat n sun because thats the time she spend with him, well i guess i couldnt handle the "us not talking" for two days and called her out on it because come monday i would all of a sudden "exist." i basically treated her like a gf; kissing, holding hands, making out, fucking, i/she would spend the night etc and she would obviously treat me the same but in private anyway we would always end up fighting on the weekends over this and make up monday after talking about her neglecting me. things would come up like her feelings for me were "strong" she couldnt live without me, nobody makes her laugh like i do or pleasures her like i do. last thursday we were supposed to hangout but she ditched me to hangout with her boyfriend, she said she wasnt with him but i found out through a mutual friend it was a lie. soooo i told her ive had enough and that it was either him or me and she chose him so i blocked her from snapchat and fb leaving her with a simple "if you need me you have my number and thats all you need. come look for me if you decide to make the right choice" basically now im really depressed i have no one to hangout with, no warm feeling of holding someone, those relationship feelings(even though we werent anything) i cant get her out of my head, it hurts. i dont know what to do.	11

i made an internet friend and what we had is kind of over and honestly i'm sad. we didn't say much to each other, just replying the same thing to each other's comments and i don't know. i always smiled when i saw he replied back. i'd tell my friend who knows about it, and i'd say "he replied back again!" and then she'd say "woo" and it was always a thing i looked forward to. sometimes he'd be gone for a couple of days and i'd worry that he forgot, but he never did. and now it's over and i'm just a bit more melancholy. you know? like the moment was here, and the moment has passed. such is life i suppose, but i enjoyed our moment.	3

feeling really lost..? so i'm dealing w multiple chronic illnesses as once which i'm not sure how but ig i swam in the wrong gene pool.. (dumb joke im sry) but i've been incredibly just morbidly depressed. i haven't been to school in like 3 months i can hardly leave me house unless it's my grandparents forcing me to go get coffee (drive thru) or if i have to go to physical therapy. i'm not gonna day i haven't thought about suicide, but i don't even want to die anymore i just feel like i already did. i haven't gone a day w out breaking down in lord knows how long.. i try to talk with my family ab it but they just get mad and call me dramatic or threaten to send me away like wtf is that. they'd rather just keep things bottled up and it nobody talks about anything. this has made it impossible for me to speak out about anything. i've met w 1 therapist recently who i just didn't click with, but broke down entirely in front of him and just couldn't speak my mind bc i've been forced to keep quiet my whole life. when i was around 7 my mother had me see a therapist and i was put on meds. age 7. for adhd which we found out later i didn't even have! i was a hyper kid. i was 7. they realized it was an anxiety disorder by like 9 which is insane i was literally not even in double digits with an anxiety disorder. i was instantly pulled from it. i've noticed that i would generally be so much better if i completely distances myself from most of my family but being 16 that's pretty unrealistic. my age also makes me invalid to them as it just appears to be "teen angst". they're mad at me for not wanting to talk to them ab the weather or social media i just don't have the energy to pretend to be happy anymore. they roll their eyes call me bitchy etc. etc. but if you don't like it then help me fix it!!! i'm srsly losing it...	11

i finally quit my extremely toxic job. it still hasn't set in that i don't ever have to go back this company has done me dirty time and time again. i've seen them lie and cheat customers, damage cars by being negligent and not following procedure. they set up an appt to suspend/terminate a manager for sexually assaulting me twice on the job (and somehow lost the video evidence) but came down unexpectedly to fire an actual good manager. i was shoved in a barrel and one guy sat on top of it so i couldn't get out (lmk if you want to hear any more of their hilarious pranks ) they also edited my timecards without me knowing and would change the schedule and not tell anyone. today they tried to suspend me (unpaid of course) for "not stopping another employee for steal products." i was the only one cleaning (everyday occurrence to the point where they joke about it. there's another fun story for that too) when it happened but because i was on the clock i was guilty by association. i never touched the car and i didn't know the employee gave a free service but they were going to suspend me for two weeks anyways. so i quit and am using those unpaid two weeks to find another job. i'm proud of myself. it was like an abusive relationship. promises of things changing and "we really need you"s to get me to stay. some people are encouraging me to take legal action. should i?	11

i'm out of youtube, help hopefully that title doesn't seem clickbait-y anyway, i say to people a lot that i've "ran out of youtube". essentially i don't mean i've literally watched every video on youtube, but i've gone through all the content i can find that i enjoy. i tend to end up rewatching things over and over again. i've watched the same 23.5 hour game grumps series three and a half times. the point is i watch a lot of youtube, as a way to occupy and entertain myself, and i would love recommendations! i've asked all my friends but at this point i've burned through all of those too. for reference, i'm subscribed to miniladd, vanoss, sovietwomble, the game and film theorists, cinemasins, and jacksfilms. i'm probably looking for a gamer, comedy mainly. i also really like bloodborne, but at this point i think i've watched all the videos on that topic youtube has as well thank you in advance!	9

i'm thankful for every dumb, cringe-worthy thing i've ever done. everyone has moments in their lives they absolutely hate, whether it was a stupid mistake or saying something dumb. remembering moments like these makes me want to jump off a cliff, sometimes i swear the embarrassment of these memories can cause physical pain. but now i appreciate them. i used to hate being constantly reminded of my dumb past desicions, but i realized that if i wasn't i'd probably be repeating the same stupid things. that crippling embarrassment is a built-in way of ensuring i never make those mistakes again. thanks nature for making my self-hate constructive! just wanted to share this in case anyone needs justification for this very annoying part of being a person.	18

he (20m) already has a girlfriend but i (17f) like him soooo much so i met him at the gas station after i got off from school. he is just my type he's lightskin, tall and has a lot of tattoos and i just wanna marry him and run away with him right now. so yeah i saw him at the gas station and we just kept staring at each other. i was too scared to ask for his number because i don't approach boys, boys approach me. but when i started walking home, his car pulled up next to me and he told me that i looked good and he wanted my number. i almost passed out. he also took me home, so that was fun and also awkward but still fun. so we started texting for a little bit just getting to know each other and then we started talking on the phone alllll night. this made me even more crazy about him. i told him how old i was and that i was still in high school. he joked that he wasn't trying to catch another charge but i told him that it's only 3 years so it didn't matter. i got him to tell me his government name and i looked him up on facebook. he already has a girlfriend. she's so ghetto and unattractive, i'm offended for him. she's always arguing with him online and posting really stupid stuff. i asked him if he had a girlfriend and he told me "don't worry bout that you my lil baby that's all that matters." i like him like a whole lot. he looks better than every guy at my school. i'm not trying to be anyone's side chick or anything, i want to be his only girl. he's taking me to the bowling alley tomorrow so yeah. how do i bring this up without making him look at me sideways tl;dr: guy i'm currently talking to has a girlfriend but i like him and i'm pretty sure he likes me too. but i want to be his girlfriend and the only one he talks to. how do i bring this up to him?	15

involved in my first "serious" car accident so today was a bit of a "milestone" depending on how you look at it. our family was dispersing from our annual campout. grandparents hollered that they needed help, my uncle had broken down. we got out there with my grandpa's truck and flatbed, loaded up my uncle's popup camper that was broke and started off. not too far down the road the flatbed started fishtailing. two notes i have to put here: 1. past couple of weeks i've been watching dash cam videos on youtube idk why but i find it interesting. 2. i'm a roller coaster junkie, i never thought i could say it would give me a skill that's useful in real life. i can't say if watching those dashcam videos helped train my brain or something but i almost had this feeling i knew what was happening an instant before it got out of control. at that moment my body went into my "coaster mode", it's the only way i can describe it but it's like an uber relaxed state but as they post in coaster stations "head and shoulders back against the seat back for the duration of the ride". i rode it out like that "until the ride came to a complete and final stop. what confuses me is the details are fuzzy but i remember being aware of everything that was happening through the spin. we wound up facing the opposite direction in the ditch. checked on grandpa, we were both shaken but unscathed, not even a bruise. checked behind us and the flatbed was upside down on top of the popup clear from the truck by at least 5ft, it's a miracle that trailer detached in the spin i imagine. i understand an adrenaline rush now, much better than before. and i'm wondering if i was in shock at first because i would have thought it would be more of an ordeal. most important part though is everyone made it out alright. and on a plus the truck made it out intact aside from a bent bumper and hitch and blown rear tires. the flatbed was flipped over and still in what you could say is "pre accident" condition. it's pulling the popup debries home now. i'm honestly not sure if this even belongs here but i felt i should write it up and figured i'd see if anyone had anything interesting to say. on a side note if anyone is interested in a "lightly used" popup camper that comes with kindling and requires some assembly i know of one	1

weightlifting; why do people do it? not sure if this belongs here, sorry if it doesn't. tried it on r/fitness but it was removed. why do people take on the hobby of weight lifting? i started weightlifting a few days ago and i just realized how (i'm gonna get hate but here it goes ) unhealthily in a way it is. every weightlifting supplement out there is full of artificial sweeteners, there's bulking up which people often get carbs from everywhere possible (fast food) then "cutting " etc i've always wanted to have this hobby but now i'm not even sure anymore if it means not being healthy.. back when i was in 7-8th i was really obese then i started losing it by sophomore and started doing track/cross country and i started doing all of this because my family has a strong diabetes history which i wanted to avoid which is why i completely took all sugar out of my diet and all the unhealthy food out along with it.. weightlifters of r/fitness why do you have this hobby?	7

the hunt is over i found my soulmate!!!! (guide on how to find a gf, like my new bf found me!) (he is letting me post this btw) tl;dr, do not!!! send unsolicited dick pics!!! you are cock blocking yourself!! just act friendly, and you'll unlock almost unimaginable opportunities with women. for guys: this can be a guide for cute chubby wubby guys who are socially awkward and are seeking girlfriends. pay attention to how my new bf acts. for girls: pay attention to how i act. story: so, im a girl who likes tall, clean faced, chubby guys, and had a friend like this. he's adorable. he looks like a big ol' teddy bear. i got a lot of my dark sense of humor from him and he's overall just really funny and kind to me. i am on reddit often, so i learned a thing or two about men. i saw a post saying how men like when women make the first move, so i texted him first today. i understand most guys sense of humor; jokes about genocide, gross stuff and crusades, so i made the text in a way it looked like it was supposed to be a joke, so if he got weirded out, i had a plan b. the text went like this; (note: this was just talk. none of us actually want to do these things) me: can we go on a date to chuck'e'cheese and i bite your neck with children screaming and running beneath our feet and the place smells like foot fungus that would be so romantic him: you might be my soulmate (lol i knew i was headed in the right direction) him: and then when we're done eating our gourmet aids pizza we can drown the children in the ball pit and give them hives this went back and forth until i sent him a pic of a ring pop in an engagement ring case and said to marry me. this was meant to be a complete joke, until we talked for a couple more minutes and we exchanged snaps. he friend requested me and i messaged him "hey bb" and we talked for an hour and i remember us referencing videogames like star wars and spider-man, sending blursed images to each other, etc. then i asked him how it felt to have a gothic gamer gf. (referencing "big titty goth gf" meme) and that was the first time one of us brought up the girlfriend-boyfriend topic. he said it felt great. that's when we made it official. today is a good day. and because of this day, i will pass my luck on to whoever reading. have a good day, people of reddit.	3

finally found a song i have been looking for for years the song is the theme from spartakus & the sun beneath the sea. i remember watching the show when i was a young kid and have since been looking for said song. ended up finding the song by searching for all the words i could remember. proceeds to play the song on repeat.	19
i could have bought a geforce 1080ti. i saw them go on sale, finally, 700 bucks and i could have it. i just got my bonus! but i owe in taxes this year and i have some minor debt from other purchases. so i did the responsible thing. i payed off 2 credit cards, and the rest will go to taxes. maybe the bottom will drop out of crypto currency and all those gpu farmers will sell off at low cost. hope springs eternal but i could have bought it just now. they are already sold out. temptation is gone.	19

arguing with men vs. women first of all. don't argue with women if you're not fond of losing. they do not use any parameters of logic or reason to win that being said the main difference is that when a man wins he wantw you to say "you're right" vs. when a woman wins she wants you to say "i was wrong" ...	9
a person, who i have known for two years, just referred to me and my wife as "very good friends" we are lesbians and have been married for eight years i honestly have no idea how the topic never came up? but i afterwards i mentioned we were married and her eyes got really wide and she looked surprised. though she is not incorrect, me and my wife are both very good friends, i'm just surprised she never knew about the whole marriage aspect	12

would you consider dating a virtual woman if the best virtual woman you could date is not in your league? **can't edit title: i meant if the best real girl you could date is not in your league!** also i hope you understand what i'm saying about a girl not being in "your league" i know it's a confusing phrase but i just don't want to hurt anyone's feelings tonight especially if they're a girl. <url> i thought about if i could have the chance to date/marry my favorite vtuber and ditch my fiancee, i would probably still pick my fiance but it's a close call. do any of you have a crush on a vtuber and are you willing to say who she is? (just curious)	10
i went on a date today and it went well! i think i'm finally understanding healthy relationships for the first time in my life. hi guys! i just wanted to let someone know because i can't tell my friends - i've had a long history of getting into unhealthy relationships and having them fall apart quickly and disastrously, so i'm keeping it quiet for as long as i can. over the past year after my most recent breakup i took a dating hiatus to focus on rebuilding myself, going to therapy, shuffling around my priorities and changing some friendships or friends in general, and i think i now know how to date without majorly hurting myself! he paid for dessert and offered me his jacket because we had to run in the rain, didn't even check his phone once the whole time and it really made me feel appreciated and valued! thanks for listening, i know it isn't a really big deal but it's so nice to feel some kind of romance after a long time.	3
my (26 f) sil has accessed my bank account and has caused me moral and ethical dilemmas i have been banking with my current bank since i was 16, which my sister in law happens to work at (in the claims dept as a debt collector). i found out yesterday that she has looked at my bank account without reason, other than being nosy. my husband works for his father and his mother is an accountant, and they were discussing taxes and returns, as we have both had a child and gotten married this past year - his brother was at his parents at the time, and made the comment that we shouldn't struggle at all because i make a lot of money, more than him and his wife combined... then told my husband not to tell me, but that my sil has looked at my bank account and was she was upset that i made as much as i do. i have had multiple issues with my sister in law in the past- she put her daughter in my mother's classroom and has told my mom crazy lies about my husband (like that he stole his moms money and her car ) and is constantly fishing for information about me (especially now that i have a newborn). my husband and i had a destination wedding, which she made all about her and left me babysitting her child during my wedding/vacation, but that's a whole other story. i know his family is thinking i'm petty, but i've been using the newborn excuse to stay away from family gatherings... but i know the excuse won't last forever, and she's already mad that i haven't let her "meet the baby". i'm very tempted to report her to the bank, although if i did and she lost her job, it would be a family stink that may, in the long term, damage my marriage. switching banks is also highly inconvenient. i'm very torn about what to do, and don't even know that confronting her is an option, she is crazy and likely to turn herself into the victim. tldr; my sil looked at my finances and bank account without permission.	11

i made a blanket fort with my 22 year old boyfriend and we did nothing but lay around, play video games and fornicate. what is love? this...this is love. i've wanted a boyfriend to make a blanket fort with me my entire life. finally, i have one. saturday night we got home a little drunk, put together blankets and pillows and crawled in only to spend all sunday in there. it was magical. i only made this post now because i'm missing him. he's out in the field all week and no form of communication. i'm just lying in my blanket fort (yes it's still built) and looking at photos of us. edit: made a new fort and took photos this time <url>	15

charlie brooker's "dead set" 10 years since the mini-series dead set aired on tv and i'm still surprised that many horror fans still haven't seen it and being such an influential horror show of it's time, it's a crime not to watch it. overall it isn't a special show but the content of it does show a lot of what lacks in horror shows and that's bones of realism and nothing too wimped down. charlie brooker wrote this smart and risked a lot with the concept of having it be based around a sucky-reality tv but the end result was definitely something to make horror fans smile. he's the one who wrote and created "black mirror" that enough is more of a reason to watch this. the characters are typical cliche reality tv people that end up caught up in something seen in horror film while zombies are killing people outside. there are a lot of moments that stand out for me from the first episode all the way to its end episode. the ending that featured a lot of surprises and twists which ended the show so shockingly that it felt wrong but right at the same time. the song by mika still gives me chills. you've definitely seen clips. what are your thoughts on this show? a sequel or not?	1

the emoji has desensitised me to all forms of humor. it's the laugh track of emojis. it immediately makes anything that could have been funny and strips it of joy. and, to be completely honest, even without the emoji the content probably wasn't funny to begin with. i almost read the emoji as a desperate push to move people from a careless smirk to a mild chuckle. am i reading too far in to this?	1

i've f [22] been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend m [34] for a year and a half but it's getting really hard tl;dr i love my boyfriend so so much but we live 2 and a half hours away from each other. this wouldn't be a problem but he has a new job, no car, with very little savings and i'm in school, have no job, a problematic car and not much money either. he's had some setbacks so please nobody tell me he isn't successful enough for me or say anything about him just wanting me because i'm 22. he really needs to grind in this new job to save money for a car, and just for savings in general. i've been driving to him almost every weekend for the past 3 months and it's kind of ruined my poor old car. i have no idea what to do. it seems like i want to take a break every other week with him, and i feel bad for being so hot and cold with him. neither of us have ever cheated or are even concerned with that. he seems to be fine with staying in the relationship but i think it's because he's older and is afraid that if i'm out of his grip, he'll lose me for good and have to get over me. what should i do? try to say hey let's wait till i graduate? or until we both have more money? i want to go on dates and stay at his house late at night and be able to drive over to mine, but i don't want that with anyone but him. it's so hard. i can't tell if i'm too young and immature for this relationship, and if i need to break up for both of our sakes because he won't. i'm rambling now. any advice at all would be greatly appreciated	3

i (f23) am so tired of living at home and dealing with my mother (f56) i graduated last spring and have since moved home and got a decently cushy job for my gap year into professional/grad school. my applications open up in june so i've been on edge since last september on studying for the relevant entrance exams and pulling my life together. getting a full time job has some what pushed back my study schedule and i find myself drowning in the work and locking myself up in my room to study. that being said, i occasionally emerge from my room to eat food and relax at the dining room table. a common "conversation" that comes up when my mother and i are home alone involve "why aren't you studying, don't you have goals?" and i answer her in apparently a very rude ( ) way, "i'm relaxing." today was not much different but i've honestly had it and my short temperament (who did i inherit it from lol) emerged and my usual answer was followed by a "please stop asking." the argument then escalated to me being too fresh mouthed with my very asian and conservative mother on how she failed to raise me as a proper daughter (??). she then proceeds to raise a hand to slap me, to which i point out that she will, and we end up in a stare down. this is usually how this conversation goes when this topic of my future comes up, and y'all.. i'm tired. i'm not sure i can keep up this stupid facade of being a compliant daughter who bends to her parents will at all times because it's clearly getting me nowhere and nothing but frustration. i'm honestly trying my best and of course i'm studying but lately i've been going through this existential crisis on whether this healthcare career path is really worth it. having a mother who honestly provokes me under the guise of "conversation" is becoming too much and while i think running away to move in with my boyfriend and get a masters in an irrelevant program at my alma mater would be great, it's not my plan and i refuse to give up on my plan to be a dentist. i'm just not sure i can handle living at home much longer until i can submit my application and be done with this whole nonsense. i apologize for the ranty nature of this post as this literally just happened an hour ago but hearing my own mother say "i didn't raise you to speak to me this way... move out... you're really making my heart bleed..." spiel doesn't do much beyond annoy me than guilt me into giving her an apology or whatever she wants. i want to start being more independent and while i might be saying this out of spite, to not include my parents on my life any more than i need to. tldr, frustrated with living at home and naggy asian mom. how to break cycle of arguing about my career prospect/start being more independent so i can leave regardless if dental school doesn't work out for me? i'm going insane.	11

my 20 year dream came true yesterday i, like many young girls in the 90's, was obsessed with the backstreet boys as soon as they dropped their first album. over the last 20 years, i've been a fan of their music and always dreamed of one day getting to meet them. yesterday, the dream came true. standing in line with so many strangers in a hot convention center ballroom, i got to meet nick, a. j., and howie. it was such an incredible experience, they were everything i hoped for. they were so kind to their fans and made us all feel special. i still can't believe yesterday was real	9

why do i get so worked up about thing that don't matter (story- long and not cool ) i work as a lifeguard and got a call from a very nice sounding lady who said that one of her daughters flip flops fell out during a swim meet and asked if i could look for it . she asked if i could put it in the guard office. once i found it , i put it on the side of the lost and found and then she said she'd pick it up next week. after i got off the phone i had to rotate on. i had no time to put it in the office just yet. when i went back i saw a girl there looking for stuff in the lost and found and she was telling her friend to take some stuff for her because she was too scared. the one slipper was gone tho and i assumed she put it back in the bin . the whole rest of my shift and week was thinking "why did this freaken little bitch take 1 slipper and there were other adidas slippers so maybe since she was trying to be fast she took a mismatched pair by accident . then i thought the size was way too small for her anyways. then i said maybe she realized that and left them in the girls change room. so i had another employee check but nothing. then i was so close to leaving my work station and waiting outside the office to confront her. and when i see the lady how will i explain it was literally stolen .	1

t-posing down the street. alright, this major fuck up took place last night around 2 am, which is why it's posted now. after a long night of fucking around with my friend i had over. (my dad works nights) we had decided we want to go to the local grocery store open 24/7 to get some drinks. neither of us are 16 yet, so we take our bikes, which usually would not be a problem as this is how we usually travel. now, the main street in my town is basically a big fucking hill, so we start goin down, easily hitting 30-40 mph. i'd been learning to ride no hands and had become pretty proficient at it, almost never using hands when riding, now as a teen in 2018, my dumbass decided that i would assert my dominance over my town by t posing at high speeds, this of course resulted in me losing control of my bike, doing about 4 front flips according to my friend, skinning both elbows, a knee, and actually fuckin hitting my ass so hard it bled too. so we end up still going to the tops, where the lady working offered to get me some gauze pads, which helped with the skinned stuff. (i worried about the left asscheek later) but as it turns out i hit my head about 3 times pretty damn hard on the sidewalk, so after a quick examination from my doctor grandmother, i have a pretty fuckin major concussion, so technically i shouldn't even be looking at this screen rn, but hey, internet points! tl;dr t posed down the street going 30-40 mph on my bike and skinned both elbows, my knee, my ass bled, and i have a concussion now	0

my niece and nephew are convinced that "howdy" is the only correct way to say hello in the us lol, i am babysitting them and i said, "well you can always say hello-", and they answered no, you can't say "hello" in the us, only *howdy*. (or sometimes, howdy *y'all*) people won't understand if you say "hello." the correct way to say hi in the us, is to walk up to them and say "howdy" and then you tip your hat. and if you are wearing a dress, you curtsy. if you don't do that then it's rude. also, the only thing you eat for lunch in the us is hotdogs. no other food, it *must* be hotdogs. so, my american redditos. how correct is this theory? my wife says you can eat other things for lunch..but i'm pretty sure you can only have hotdogs..	10
so... something happened this girl that was dating this boy i liked for a while ended up having a break up with his ex, because he lost feelings for her. so she was like actually psycho and he said that he didn't wanna be with her anymore. she replied saying that they hadn't made 3 months and she just wanted 4 more days (because then they'd reach 3 months) he said no multiple times and it stressed him out as to how hardheaded she is. so she kept calling him and calling him and my friends girlfriend answered saying "hello why are you calling him?" she replied while crying "i need to talk to him" my friends girlfriend told her to stop calling her "boyfriend". so then she went and called me to talk to me about it an ofc i didn't really care. she was crying and she said she would make his life a living hell. in my head i thought i shouldn't feel bad for her because he wanted to leave the toxic relationship. so i didn't feel bad. so then i hung up on her face i didn't wanna listen to her anymore and i started to get annoyed. she then tried to start hitting on me and i "broke" her heart too. as she said. then she started screaming and saying she would kill herself at that point i knew that i didn't wanna deal with her and that her ex was gonna be mine.

don't turn tv on when it's unboxed? hello i've just had a discussion with a friend since i bought a new tv and he mentioned that i shouldn't turn it on after i plugged it into the ac plug and should wait 2 hours? i've read the manual and never heard of that before... can somebody confirm? i hope i'm on the correct subreddit even though recommendations aren't allowed thanks!	9
rant- i'm constantly bored because i only have one class right now i'm a senior and i literally only need one more credit that i'm taking next quarter so right now i just have this stupid drawing class that's basically just a joke to me since i don't need the credit my school just couldn't give me all free periods so i basically don't do anything but log into class so my mom doesn't yell at me. i never realized how much of my boredom was overridden by hunching over my laptop doing homework and now i'm just ridiculously bored i have no hobbies and i'm currently jobless (looking for one) so :/ fuck man i'll help people with their homework if they want	4
i couldn't post this on r/askreddit cuz textbox so i'm here, maybe for the better so here shit goes again, 17 and my dream is to own a bar. like the title says i tried askreddit but that didn't work and thinking about it now this is probably the better sub for a question like this cuz i'm looking to converse about this topic, so that's that. anyone who has similar aspirations or maybe owns a bar feel free to say whatever, i'm really here to get a personal point of view into bar owning and what one has to endure to get there cuz that's what i want to know. also i've been drinking on this idea, i hope it's not against the rules to announce that but regardless , any info or helps appreciated and thanks. points if you're drunk to 🏻	18
