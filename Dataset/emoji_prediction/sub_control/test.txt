i turned 22 today! and i just realized how much things can change in a year. same day last year, i was a shy girl uncertain about my future. this year, i know my future - i'm entering med school next month, and i've made loads of new friends. i just realized it's okay for things to change, nothing stays the same. my best friend who used to wish me at 12 every year does not wish me anymore. i now have another best friend and uni friends who took over that place. relationships change. it's astonishing how the girls you spent 13 years together in school, who spent the day talking about anything and everything just grow distant with time. many of the friends i used to go to school with are married, and have their own lives. i like to pop in a message every now and then, when their thought pops into my mind. but at the same time, every year, there will always be new people, new relationships and new memories. i realized that every year, i make new friends. some friends stay with you for a long time, some don't. it's okay. you will always find someone who will warm your heart, and that is enough ^(english is not my first language, and while i'm loads better now, i'm still a socially awkward person who has a jumbled head, so my rambling might not be the clearest.)	‚ù§Ô∏è
ruined my chances with a whole group of people. ah, isn't that a nice smell in the evening i was in a group chat like i mentioned in my previous post (that people are downvoting for no reason) and completely ruined my odds with everyone in that group by saying i was leaving because nobody was answering when i tried to start a conversation, so i left and now i get to live the rest of my summer knowing i fucked up my chances with like 7 people because of my shit social skills.	üòé
whoops lol so i've been talking to this chick lately. and things were going pretty well in my opinion. we had been friends for a bit, and we got along really well. but idk what happened. i didn't do anything wrong. but just kinda got friend zoned lol. so idrk where else to just blow off some steam but here. sorry guys	üòÖ
i thought i had it bad, but i overheard others discussing their situation and it really put things in perspective. so i'm like super upset because my first bus was late so i have to wait at the station for about an hour for the second bus to arrive. while i was in the restroom i overheard a woman ask another lady for some cash so she can ride the bus and the lady in response said "i'm homeless" and then they both said that they would pray for each other... after hearing that i feel so bad. i wish i could do something but i honestly don't have any cash on me... i literally had to run out of their due to the extreme guilt i was feeling and i feel so stupid for being upset about my situation in the first place... now i'm just waiting and i honestly don't feel that bad knowing things could be worse, just hearing people going through hard times makes me so upset because there's nothing i can do... i just feel so disgusting having the things i have knowing people will just never have the same opportunities as me. i'm so so sorry (doing my best not to burst into tears right now!)	üò≠
does anyone have any good stories of when your trust was broken by a so and you were able to move past it? i (f26) recently went through a rough patch with my so(m25) where they were flirt texting with a mutual friend (f26) who's close in the friend circle and i caught them. they said some stuff through text, were going out behind my back and lying about where they were going, they sent some stuff on snapchat...little things that i guess could have been worse but still feels like they have broken my heart. i also feel betrayed by this "friend" who was flirting back with my so...i'm just all sorts of hurt i can't get over feeling like this would have kept going if i hadn't caught them, and that they'll do it again if an opportunity presented itself. (this is a tl;dr version, i don't want to ramble on with the full version) i want to move past this and get over it, we have spoken about it and it seems like they are sorry and they love only me, but i'm also paranoid as fuck. i'm hoping someone has a good story of when something similar happened to you and were able to move past it. or honestly any story that will ease my heart and mind.	üôÉ

please don't offer to do something for my special needs brother if you don't mean it... *venting* i recently got hired at a company that claims it's very "family-like" where everyone looks out for each other. there are groups of people who go out and drink often and i got invited to go out as well. these groups often include managers, supervisors, hr reps...an interesting mix of people. anyway, my boss invited me out for a drink with a bunch of them so i agreed. now, there is a coworker who travels and is rarely in the office who basically has told me he likes me but understands i have a boyfriend, but he's cool with being friends and is there if i ever need something. i only really started talking to him a week or so prior. , but everyone in the office has such high regards for him. he was there and this is who this story is really about. so we all went out, we were drinking talking about ourselves, super casual, when someone asked about me and my family. i gave them a very basic answer but they wanted to dive deeper so i started talking about my younger brother who has special needs. now i should preface that my family is a peculiar case. my parents were alcoholics/ drug addicts, mental illness was/is rampant in my family. my little brother is currently diagnosed with "pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified," the doctors basically said "hey something is wrong with him but we don't specifically know what." as a child he was diagnosed with autism, and then mental retardation. and that kid has come a damn far way. he was practically nonverbal as a child and had explosive anger issues. after our mother died and then our father was arrested with 16 duis and 3 felonies we were taken in by a family member. she got my brother into many different therapies including social skills, speech therapy, group therapy, the works. now he lives in a special needs assisted living community (in his own apartment!), has a job at a grocery store bagging and collecting carts, has a girl friend (also special needs), and he was in the special olympics. i'm pretty protective of him, we've been through some fucking shit and we made it. but, i'm not always there for him like i would like to be and i really should be spending more time with him and taking him out. anyway, they were asking about him and i told them how he's been a little lonely since he graduated high school where he saw his friends everyday, and there were planned activities/events. he has also regressed in terms of social skills and language due to the fact that he isn't in school anymore and he is interacting mostly with other individuals who struggle with communication skills. i think this has been a quite an issue for him as he has expressed frustration due to difficulties in communicating how he's feeling. well the guy, was saying how he would love to hang out with my brother, take him to baseball games, the rec center, just play video games, whatever. i didn't believe him at first but he insisted that he would love to help. i honestly started to cry a little bit. it isn't often that someone outside of my family offers to do something so kind for my little bro. well fast forward a few days and he brought it up again. i wasn't going to bring it up because i just assumed he was trying to be nice and he was drunk at the time of offering. again a little overwhelmed with emotions we started talking about it and what they would do together. he then told me that him hanging out with my little brother was contingent on me basically breaking up with my boyfriend of 6 years and dating him... oh and he would have to leave him new wife that he isn't happy with. excuse me, but what the fuck? no! i was very clear that i had a long time boyfriend, and that the guy was nice and all but it's just not going to work right now, and he was cool with it. he then started saying how if my boyfriend was really "my man" that my bf would hang out with my brother (and yes we do). why the fuck would you offer this to someone after discussing that and then saying it was contingent on dating when i told them it wasn't going to happen?? omg sorry everyone but i just can't get over that. go back to your wife that you are trying to cheat on and stay away from me and my brother. tl/dr: i was telling my coworker about my special needs brother and how i don't hang with him as much as i should and he offered to be his friend/ mentor. turns out he was trying to get in my pants and the offer to be my brothers friend was contingent on that...	‚ù§Ô∏è
can "fear of commitment" be a real thing? he (31) broke up with me (32) when everything was perfect so, here's the story. i've met this guy and never had such a chemistry with someone, from the first date everything was amazing, natural and easy between us. we dated and met regularly 3 weeks. he kept saying how he is happy with me, how grateful he is to have met me. he would say and show through gestures a lot of affection. i don't think i'm wrong when saying he was certainly feeling as blissful as me. but thing is, from the beginning, i could tell he was trying to keep some distance. ever if we had amazing moments together, he would not contact much between, and be ambiguous about the next date. he was saying he wants to keep his routine on weekdays and we would meet on weekend; still he would call me spontaneously after work sometimes and ask to meet, saying he misses me. the 3rd week, i told him i might stay in australia a little bit more and study here (i was supposed to leave after 2 months because of my visa) i explained him he's not the reason i'm staying -not that i don't hope to stay with him but i don't base such a decision on one criteria- but i could feel he thought he was the reason. he even compared to his own story, since he came australia initially to follow a girl, the only long relationship he had. it didn't go well and he said he regrets the decision he made. he asked me to carefully think about everything. and that he might also leave next year due to visa uncertainty (i'm french and he's korean by the way) he said he is happy though, but that wasn't the reaction i expected... i clearly saw anxiosity on his face when i told him i might stay longer. the next day we met for a coffee quickly but i felt him distant. and on the monday, he called me and said bluntly he wants to break up. i didnt see that coming, and asked him why suddenly. he told me he doesn't see a future with me. i had many relationships before, but that's first time i have such a short one, and as the same time, first time i've felt such a bliss and connection with someone. first time in my life i felt he's the guy i've always been waiting for. he's someone who never lived more than one or two years in the same place / country, had to move all the time since childhood. and he's an extremely loving and joyful person, as if everything he has to give must be given now. is there a possibility he's just running away because things started to get serious? because he might have felt i'm rushing things? i'd like to contact him but feel so confused. i'd like to keep in touch even as friends, i feel we still had so much to share, but since he's the one who broke up.. i never faced this situation tl;dr : i've been dating this guy for a short time everything was great, and he broke up suddenly when he felt things might get serious. (such a cliche when i write this summary )	üòÇ

getting my son vaccinated i'm writing this while driving home from the hospital. this all started when i dropped my son off at kindergarten this morning, he was complaining of a sore throats and had a loud cough. he was extremely reluctant to go, but i forced him because he's just a child what does he know . anyway getting back to the story, at work i got a call saying he had a high fever and was drifting in and out of consciousness, i wasn't worried as this happened many times when he was a baby. my son isn't vaccinated, i'm a real doctor (chiropractor) and have seen the effects of vaccines on children. the teacher informed me that he had been taken to the hospital. this was bad news as he was in the hands of the organ harvesters. i raced from work to the hospital, when i arrived he was in stable condition but was sleeping. i talked to one of the doctors bribed by big pharma about the treatment they had done to him. the doctor explained how my son had whooping cough and had all his vaccinations done. i was furious, they had given my son autism. i cussed the doctor out and ripped my son out of his room and drove off. i'm hoping he doesn't turn out like our other child, that died from his vaccines. but i'm getting back at the doctors. i'm forcing my son to go to school tomorrow to test the 'herd immunity' of the vaccinated kids. tl;dr i got my son vaccinated.	üòÇ

any ideas on what to eat that has protein& carbs? a few months ago i started weightlifting and i was told i needed to consume probably 2x what i normally ate (at the time i thought what i ate was already too much) so at first i really hated having to eat so much more than i was capable of. as time went by my stomach expanded but now i just really hate eating in general. eating takes so much time especially when you have to eat 6 meals a day tbh if i could afford it i'd be consuming protein power for every meal and a granola bar for crabs. at the moment i can't do that sooo... any suggestions on what to eat that has protein and carbs? running out of stuff to eat..	üòê

i [24m] lost the battle with her [24f] hi! i just want to share how i feel today. i admitted to my friend that i like her but yeah, she did not feel the same way. after the confession, i told her that i am.open being friends again after i have move on. she told me that she needs to think about it and if i change. throughout the weeks, i worked on myself really hard to move on and i finally did it. i told her that i finally move on and i am open being friends again with her. she told me that she does npt want to be friends anymore..what's worse is that i think she completely forgot what we have talk about during my confession. she told me that she did not tell me that she needs to think about it whether we can be friends or not. in fact, she told me about it and agreed to it. in addition, she told me that whether she told me that or not, bottomline,her decision will not change it just fucking hurts especially on the part that she completely forgot what we have talked about during the confession. that part hurt me the most. i feel so depressed today. thank you guys for listening tldr: admitted to her that i like her and she never felt the same. after i move on, i told her i am open being friends again and she told me she did not want it anymore. what's worse, she completely forgot what we have talked about during the confession. it fucking hurts	üòî

i [26f] need help managing my long distance relationship anxiety with my [23m] boyfriend of 5 months hi all <3 so a bit of background info: boyfriend and i met on reddit in november 2017 in a posting that i made for friends. i live in ontario, canada and he lives in new jersey, usa. we became really fast, and close friends but i was dating someone at the time (not a good relationship), and eventually my current boyfriend and i realized that we really liked each other so i broke up with my ex-boyfriend to ultimately be with my current boyfriend. i went down to visit him in the summer for a week and we had an absolutely blast. we considered dating at that time but figured that we should see each other for a bit just to see how things go. since then i have been down to nj to visit for 5 days in september (we started dating officially during this trip), he came up and surprised me on my birthday in october, i went down to nj for a week and a half in november and we flew back together and he stayed for a few days in ontario, then we spent new years together in toronto. the next time i will see him will be end of april when we are going to spain, portugal and morrocco with his parents. we usually text for the majority of the day (using whatsapp), and we try and voice/video chat 2-3 times a week. i don't really have that many friends that i walk to besides him. he is really good at communicating with me if hes hanging out with friends or if he knows messages will be sporadic. sometimes i find myself getting snippy or sassy with him though if he is sporadically texting me (like 10-15 minutes in between messages) without him telling me if he is busy or out of the house. i realize that it's unreasonable for me to expect him to tell me everything he is doing. i try and keep busy during these times but lately i've just have been getting into these moods where i easily get upset if he does that to me. i don't want to treat him like that because i trust him fully and i don't want to be a controlling girlfriend. he also doesn't deserve my sass either when he is just doing something as simple as being at the mall, or driving to get coffee. i try to remind myself if i feel that i am getting sassy that we don't have to talk all day everyday, that he loves me, and i try and breathe and keep myself calm. i need advice on how to keep myself more calm during the times when he is sporadic or doesn't tell me what he is up to because i realize that is unreasonable and controlling. please help tl:dr; bf and i live in different countries, i feel anxious when he messages me sporadically without telling me what he's doing.	‚ù§Ô∏è

working out. hey there :) a little back story on me, i'm a 15 year old girl with depression and anxiety issues and i'm doing my best to cure my daily struggle with anything but perception medicine because my entire family says that we don't react well to any of the medicine provided by a pharmacy. my sister's anxiety got tremendously worse, my mother fell into a deep depression and my father says he felt like a robot that lacked feeling. so i've started looking into working out. i think it would be perfect for me but my anxiety says people will judge me because i'm already a very tiny person and idk, maybe they think i'm to young to worry about working out?? anyways. i'm going to try it once and if it makes me anxiety worse i'll stop but if it doesn't it might help me a lot. but i don't know what to start out with. i don't even know the first thing about working out does anybody know what would work best for me in the gym?	üòÇ

how should i [21f] tell my parents i have a boyfriend [27m]? so i have been with my boyfriend for 8 months and we known of each other for about a year or so [we worked in the same place] and i do love him and want a future with him. i'm turning 22 later this year in october and i have a very strict mom, but my dad is way more easygoing and i'm closer to him. we're from the caribbean, so parents are always asking their daughters to focus on school and their lives before worrying about relationships and boys. i've never given my parents any reason not to trust me. i'm doing well in school and i know how i want my future to go. i'm nervous that if i tell them, then they'll focus more on the sexual part instead of the emotional connection and how happy he makes me. i know some people will say that i'm an adult, which i am, but i do live with my parents [rent free] since i am in college, working, and am planning my life. i have always felt like since i live under their roof, then i should follow their rules, but idk maybe someone can help me figure out how to go about this. (please no rude comments, thank you ) tldr: how should i [21f] tell my parents about my boyfriend [27m]?	üòä

how i got shit all over myself this morning. oh, hi. i have a story you're gonna love. it's about how i accidentally smeared shit all over myself this morning. i woke up super early with the urgent need to poop due to eating half a pizza and half a box of oreos last night. i sit on the toilet, and on the ground i see a tiny little bug, so i squish it with a kleenex. oddly enough there is no dead bug on the ground, and no dead bug on the kleenex. whatever! i proceed to have explosive diarrhea. fast forward to wiping time. as i go to wipe my ass, mid-wipe i look down.... there is the bug on my leg it stealth climbed up me and is now running around on me in a panic. in this moment, i instantly forget i am wiping explosive munchies poops off myself, and my hands start flailing to smack the bug off of me. with dirty toilet paper in hand. and that, people of reddit, is how i ended up with shit all over myself this morning. thanks for coming to my ted talk.	üôÉ

how do i (23f) get over my ridiculous jealousy over my ex (27m) and his wife's (28f) life together? soooo ima try to keep this short. basically, we dated almost a year and it was my first relationship ever. it moved too fast but at the time i didn't know. i had zero idea. i loved it tho. found out he was not only cheating on me with girls on dating apps, but he was married. he said all the excuses and said they were gonna get divorced, and it could take a few years so he'd come back when it was all done.... ok. he said her whole social media is to appear normal to her friends, she doesn't want them to know she's a cheater etc. anyways long story short, tried to tell his wife and she told me to fuck off and she didn't wanna hear anything else i had to say. ok. fine. i left it alone.. figured she knows so i can't do much else. long story short part 2.. i still miss him and look at his and her ig so often that it's embarrassing. i don't know why i even still want him because looking back i realize how much he lied and his stuff...?? who wants that. i see her posting cute pictures of her "little family" and things they do together, how happy she is etc. and im so... jealous? she has what i thought i was gonna have and it's like my heart still can't let it go. it doesn't make sense. guarantee he's still cheating and lying to her...so why would i be jealous? no idea. i don't know how to stop though. even if i don't look at them on social media, i still think about him constantly and secretly hope he was honest and he'll come back :( but why?? my sister and dad have said even if we got married one day, he'd cheat on me all the time too, and why would i want that etc. but it's bc for some reason i still love him??? tl;dr; ex bf was a married cheater and liar. we broke up with him saying he'll be back one day and is getting divorced etc. told the wife she said to fuck off. i check her ig and for some reason feel jealous bc she has what i thought i'd have. i still miss him. don't know why. how do i get over it tho? :(	üôÑ

(skip to end if you want to hear idea) a bit of a rant about karma and my idea for fixing it to me upvotes are relatively meaningless, this isn't even my main account but i mostly lurk on my main account or look at memes. on this account i just follow subs like r/teenagers, r/crushes, r/socialskills, stuff of that sort, and i try to both give and receive advice. it's for me trying to be wholesome and helpful, and to try to improve myself at the same time. most of my comments are either trying to help people get out of tough situations or encouraging them to go try something they're thinking about doing; in short, i'm using my experience to help others (and also using this to ask for advice sometimes). however as you can imagine, most posts that blow up in this sub are memes, so this is one of the few subs that i generally sort by new on, in order to find posts where i can be helpful. that results in me not really getting much karma from most of my posts or comments, which i'm fine with--my goal is to help people, not to become an internet sensation or something. so you may ask how exactly i ended up with over 13,000 karma then, and the truth is that it's from the occasional random post or stupid comment that somehow blows up. around 8-9k of my karma is from a comment on an askreddit thread, talking about the situation on our very own r/teenagers where a kid faked cancer and got all sorts of awards including almost 100 platinums. it was the day after that had happened, so it was somewhat of a hot topic, and that's how the comment ended up with over 30,000 upvotes. i got around 1,000 karma from my post talking about my confession to my crush, which i'm totally fine with--most of the posts/comments on my account are related to social/crush stuff and at the time i was so excited i just posted about it, all freaked out and everything, and it actually became popular (and got gold somehow). yesterday, on "that one story" on r/tifu (i'm not saying what post because it's kinda disturbing but you can figure it out) i commented linking a sub known for housing the most odd and repulsive posts and stories on reddit (once again, will not link due to lots of disturbing content but you can figure it out), and i got close to 1,000 karma from that as well. i guess my other 2-3k is just assorted from my other posts and comments, but this goes to show that the posts/comments that matter are not always the ones that become popular. obviously, everyone has a different definition of "what matters," but i personally think that most of my work on this account is good and it helps a lot of people, despite the lack of upvotes. this is why i propose that we isolate the memes from more serious content. obviously, we have post flairs and whatnot here on r/teenagers, but i still think it could be worthwhile to create a sub named something such as r/teenagerssocial, r/teenagersadvice, or something of that sort, in which we can move towards a better community of helping each other. not that this isn't a good sub, but i feel like a more specialized and less broad subreddit could make it possible for more people to get the advice, encouragement, or reassurement they need. thanks for coming to my ted talk	üòé

ok so i saw this man i 24f, was walking around the art district in fort lauderdale with two friends. twas after a couple drinks and puffs. mellow mood. this man in a cowboy hat and cowboy boots walked passed me and damn we had this eye moment. i turned around and he was already staring back at me. then after at least half an hour or more, walking to different bars, i saw him again sitting in a curb, and had another intense eye staring shit going on. i can't stop thinking about it. it felt like a movie besides for no ending to it	üòÇ

calling my now ex fat never loose weight like the title says i fucked up really good. my ex started working out recently to lose weight. and i recently subscribed to /r/fatpeoplehate and i found out my true colour. it began yesterday. we were talking about her weight now and she didn't want to tell me and i got a bit pissed of because i wanted to know it. and i called her fat. she got so angry that she came right after work to my place(i live alone) and took everything from her. i got her convinced that she didn't had to do all of that. and it was back okay. and today i really fucked up. this morning around 11am i was texting her and she suddenly said to me to fuck off. no explanation or anything. then i got her convinced to tell me what was wrong. she told me that i was on /r/gonewild and that i upvoted posts there and even commented what was true. and i got annoyed by that, if i even can't look at those hot chicks i mean what's wrong with that? doesn't matter she got really angry and i got annoyed and called her fat again and if she would loose weight i hadn't any reason to look at that sub. she didn't understand and got angry and made me even more annoyed and i called her fat again and told her to start working out more. she called me psychopath and that i'm crazy and i need to respect her and keep my promises. i then fucked up by telling that i wanted to unpromis all of the promises. she got angry and said that's not normal and shit like that. i fucked up further by telling her she should better not change subject and looe weight. well she became very angry and send me a lot of hate messages and i called her then and i was all the time calm and laughing at everything because i thought we were both joking and shit like that because that happens more often. she said she was preparing her self make up and shit and would come over to my place to take everything that was hers. well she came by while i was showering and came in the shower with my phone and i had to explain her how to delete all the photos because i'm using android and she is used to iphone. then when i was done showering i let her delete the last photo's that i had of her. she took the laptop her clothes her stuff make up and all what was hers. well i fucked up and i don't have a pc anymore. my ex stole everything i had i came back in an empty apartment and she stole also my laptop and tv and name it. now my now ex took her laptop back because i couldn't afford one right now. i'm now without a pc without a laptop just my phone and my stuff i got. well i fucked up and i'm beginning next month with my new education for medical to be a male nurse in a er department. well i don't know what to say now. i fucked up. tl;dr: i fucked up gf broke up with me and i lost her and the laptop what is really a pain in the ass there goes my /r/pcmasterrace i hope you guys understand this and don't come with the hate of people who don't like fat people. it's not that i don't like people who are fat i have a lot of fun with them and to hang out with them but they should do something about their weight. well enough said. i fucked up and have no aid in the world no family no gf no support that's a bitch edit: i can't change it in the title but thank you for pointing it out to me that i misspelled lose as loose. english is not my first language but i try thank you /u/hairy_onions	üò¢

playing *bad boys* during a traffic stop this morning i was driving to work in a happy mood since it is pay day. i was in a rush and was pulled over for speeding in a zone that was being prepared for construction. thinking i could lighten the mood, i remembered gabriel iglesias' special and threw on *bad boys*. the officer came up to the car, and the first thing out of his mouth was, "so you think you're funny, huh?" (in a very humorous tone i might add) . i completely misread that, thinking he's seen the comedy special, and responded with a sarcastic yes (more like a flamboyant "absolutely"). the cop takes my info and comes back with a max fine ticket, and tells me to get on my way. tl;dr played *bad boys* to a cop during a traffic stop and basically negated payday with my new ticket. *mega edit: since some people aren't understanding this all correctly, i will explain some more. i get that i was in the wrong, i'm not fighting to get the ticket off completely, i'm fighting to have the ticket reduced from a double fine. the "construction zone" rule should not have been enforced because it was not in the time parameter. yes, i should be fined $150 for speeding, i am fine with that. no, he should not have issued me a $300 ticket for speeding in a construction zone. i called the police headquarters and just got out of a meeting with the sheriff and my cousin (who is an officer in the same department) and they agree with me, the evidence is on my side. i don't hate construction workers and i was not trying to be an ass, i was going the flow of traffic. this argument is taking away from the original intent of the post, and yes, he did appreciate the song after the fact, but me playing the song took me from a warning to a ticket as well ($25 infraction for the song)* **wow front page! guess it was worth it to get ticketed **	üòÇ

getting floss stuck in my teeth so, i've had a bonded retainer for a couple months now and didn't really get properly trained how to floss under them.... i haven't been flossing under them. recently though i found out that there's this floss called "super floss" that has stiff ends so you can wedge it under your retainer and clean the areas. on my first piece of floss i started flossing away and it tore causing a small bit of floss to get caught in between my teeth in a hard to reach place..... not gonna lie but i'm pretty annoyed about this because it's in a place that floss can't typically reach because of the retainer and the so called special floss isn't stiff enough to push the bit out. 15 minutes later no luck getting it out tl;dr i bought a floss that was supposed to be more efficient than regular floss and it got caught in my teeth	üò≠

what do i (27f) about my college friend (28f) who is probably upset with me for missing her rehearsal dinner? don't know how to do a crosspost, and this will get deleted if i add a link, but please read my last post on the weddingplanning sub. after apologizing for not communicating, she told me to figure things out and let her know and she would not feel any differently about our friendship regardless of my decision. i replied that i was happy to hear her say that, and that i would let her know. no reply. then thursday (3 later), i sent this text: *hey, so i confirmed with work today that i would be penalized if i leave early or call out on friday, so i definitely won't be able to make the rehearsal dinner (or anything before like 9:30pm - flight lands @8:57). i would love to be one of your bridesmaids still, but if it's important that i be at the dinner to do so, i understand and will just be a guest. let me know!* she is always a fast replier (within an hour) and has never ignored a text of mine. but she has not replied to this, but is posting stories with friends on instagram. i'm suspecting she's upset with me, but don't know how to broach this. it's really upsetting me. tl;dr: please see my other post for context. my friend might be upset that i will miss her rd.	‚ù§Ô∏è
i sucked my own penis it has been 4 hours since i successfully sucked my own penis. things are different now. as soon as mouth-to- penis contact was made i felt a shockwave through my body. i have reason to believe i have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact i noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. i fear for my safety, i'm not sure what sort of power i may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. if i don't update this again please send help. update: just escaped from the pentagon, the government is sending all their military forces to pursue me, my life is currently in extreme peril. they attempted to strip my ability to suck my own penis but i created a shockwave to blast away the researchers before they could touch me. this is bad, i have exhausted all my chromosomes and now i have to hide and replenish my energy while the patrol helicopters fly over me.	üòé
be honest with yourself to be fair, you have to have a very high iq to understand rick and morty. the humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. there's also rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from narodnaya volya literature, for instance. the fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about life. as a consequence people who dislike rick and morty truly are idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in rick's existencial catchphrase "wubba lubba dub dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to turgenev's russian epic fathers and sons i'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as dan harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. what fools... how i pity them. and yes by the way, i do have a rick and morty tattoo. and no, you cannot see it. it's for the ladies' eyes only- and even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 iq points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.	üòÇ

my depression has gotten way better over this last year. and reddit has helped me loads! please take time out of your day to read my story! thank you i'm happy to say that after using this app for 1 year today, my life has changed. i've made really good friends whom i cherish and love. i've been welcomed into community's and felt part of something. and also been given direct content consumption that is hard to find anywhere else, taking my mind of some of my real life traumas. during this past year reddit has helped me find out about myself, ask for advice on certain things - which led me to speaking to a doctor and now i take anti depressants which has helped my depression so much. i was in such a dark spot a year ago today, and reddit has helped me out of that hole. if your suffering. things get better. my dms are open if anyone wants to talk or just need a friend. here's to many more years on reddit!	‚ù§Ô∏è
telling a girl her flab was "more cushion for the pushin" and ruining a budding romance. long time lurker first time poster. so today (5 minutes ago) i made a mistake, first the context... two days ago i super liked a gorgeous girl whom i'd sort of know 8 years ago. yesterday she liked me back and we started talked. as one is inclined to do we quickly moved off the tinder chat as it's horrible, and onto snapchat. we were flirting well and into each other. today at work we messaged frequently catching up on life and talking. now, a quick note regarding what's about to happen. this girl is super sarcastic and funny. she was busting my chops about complaining about working out so tonight after my workout and shower i sent a somewhat sexy pic (not a nude) to her. she had a great reaction and i thought, awesome, just upped my game. here comes the fu part. she commented that she didn't have abs like mine (not that mine are amazing) and said: "so a little flab is good for you good cuz i have a little of that for sure" (cue the fu) "a little cushion for the pushin" and shit. got. real. unbeknownst to me this girl has struggled with a serious eating disorder for 10 years and went off on my ass. i apologized profusely, assured her i found her gorgeous intelligent, sexy and driven and admired all of that and as proof i super liked her originally. but alas, the damage was done. she's done with me and can't get over how i would say that to a woman. i feel awful for triggering a terrible psychological reaction but it truly was innocent as i would never intentionally say something demeaning or hurtful (especially when i was so attracted to this girl) to a woman or anyone. however...as it was happening and it became clear my fate was sealed, the only thing i could think was that i had to post it on tifu. summary: i told a gorgeous girl her "flab" was more "cushion for the pushin" and she dumped me.	üòÇ

25f/28m i feel like i'm talking to a toddler best friends, 10 months. back and forth with feelings, long distance. hung out in person once. spend tons of time online together watching shows, playing games, etc. queue the holidays: we both are at our parents. busy, i get it. no complaints. but then we talk and he just.... disappears. 12-14 hours later i'll get a text to start a convo and then 5-6 texts later he is gone. we are now on our 3rd day of this and the last 3 convos have been about poop. literally what is happening?! i feel like i'm playing with a boy on the playground. i'm not chasing him at all, just letting him go when he goes. (no puns intended pls) when he comes back i'm warm and friendly and joking, as always. i feel like it's some sort of power play because i would usually call or check in if he is gone for that long. i'm playing cool, i don't feel anxious. i'm just really beyond confused. i'd ask him but our convos aren't getting that far	üòÇ
please read my post and help me make my dad's 90th birthday present special and, with any luck, it will help make your day a little special too! this post is long but i hope if you take the time to read this story you might find yourself inspired to step out of your comfort zone and do something that scares you! or better yet, if you have ever suffered from depression or felt overwhelmed by life, maybe - just maybe, there is a nugget or two of truth in here that helps you! and sorry, there is no tl;dr. i think the heart of this story is worth a few minutes of reading effort. if you don't have that time to give, i surely understand. skip to the end and watch the video and leave birthday wishes if you aren't interested in the backstory. my father is an amazing man and is directly responsible for all that i have been able to accomplish in my life. he turns 90 on march 8th and i wanted to do something special to celebrate his life. the story that follows is the life adventure i have been on to accomplish that task. hopefully you will be moved by the story and will help make this a special gift for my father at the end of this post. seven years ago, when my oldest son was 16, he had a little garage band. now i have no idea where he got his musical talent but that boy just started playing guitar, keyboards, drums - pretty much anything. we built him a "music room" in the bonus room above the garage and he and his band would play all day and night on the weekends. those were really good times. now i don't have a musical bone in my body. i've never played an instrument and about my only experience with music had been singing in the shower and in the car when commuting to work. but my son's excitement about music inspired me and i began writing lyrics while i was driving to work each day. i would give him the lyrics and he and his little band would turn them into songs. it was fun, interesting, and a great bonding experience. about that time, i wrote lyrics about my father's life. those lyrics just sat on my phone for a year or two. then in 2014, my father was turning 85 and the family planned a big surprise party for him. i decided maybe there was something that could be done with those lyrics if i could just find some musically inclined good samaritan to help turn them into a song. my son was off to college by now and didn't really have the interest or time to help. so i turned to reddit. first, i began posting around on various subreddits to see if someone would volunteer. i was relatively new to reddit and really didn't know the ropes very well and had trouble getting any post traction. i remember bemoaning the fact that i couldn't find anyone to help and someone started a subreddit in that thread called /r/makemysong. i quickly posted the lyrics there to see if someone would bite. here's that original post which shares a bit about the trials and challenges my father has faced (and overcome) in his life: <url> well, a few people threw up quick shots at a song but i didn't get anything that resembled a viable song nor did i get an offers for a "collaborator" to help me. so there the idea died. or so i thought. flash forward to present day. my father's 90th birthday is fast approaching and with more "reddit wisdom" i thought, "why not try again". this time i researched music-based subreddits and decided to post a plea for help writing a song on /r/songwriters. you will see that the post (link in a second below) got literally 3 upvotes and that was all this little "diy" project needed to get off the ground. /u/elbow_or_gtfo showed up and threw his hat in the ring! now i had imagined that it would be a similar process to what i had done with my son all those years ago - i would hand my lyrics to /u/elbow_or_gtfo and he would unleash his artistic ability and drop out some amazing song that i would be able to give to my dad. but this adventure became much more involved - so much more personal, exciting, scary, and - eventually - satisfying. read through that post thread here and you'll see what i mean: <url> so i'm a guy that knows exactly nothing about music and yet i've somehow written and sung a song about my dad's life? by far the scariest thing i have ever done. and yet one of the most fulfilling. as the scale of this adventure expanded so did the ideas and work. my oldest son agreed to record the guitar track for the song. i reached out to all of my siblings and nieces and nephews to have them sing the closing chorus. and we decided to create a video to go along with the song that would use old photographs - the few we had from my father's youth - along with many, many pictures of my siblings and the 12 grandchildren - to tell the story of my dad's life along with the music. and now we are closing in on the end of the adventure. i've uploaded the completed music video to youtube. my dad's birthday is this friday so we only have a day or two to wrap things up. do you want to help me finish this project? if so could you please go to the video link below and leave a comment in the youtube comments section wishing my dad a "happy 90th birthday!" and maybe mention where you are from. i am hopeful we can get 100 birthday wishes for him from all over the world. in closing, i want to say this was the scariest thing i have ever done in life. i can't think of anything more petrifying than taking your personal thoughts and words, helping to turn them into a song, and then actually singing the damn thing for everyone and their brother to hear and make fun of. but you know what? never let your fear of failure - your fear of the unknown - stop you from trying something new. and just as importantly, hopefully those of you that are currently facing life's challenges will hear in my father's story some truths that can help you work through your current situation as well. peace! here's ode to billy: <url> please share the link on social media if you can to help get him more birthday wishes!	üòä

unintentionally preparing for a colonoscopy... so. my bf and i enjoy anal, but in the past there have been some "shit happens" scenarios. he's a good sport and it doesn't phase him, but it makes me feel self conscious, so i planned to prep for next time. fast forward to today. i'm spending the weekend with him so i wanted to start prepping. i packed an enema for right before, but i figured i'd start early with some miralax. i've used miralax *correctly* before for occasional constipation, with no issues and great results. i took three times the usual dose this morning thinking 'hey, it'll go faster'. boy was i right. i don't know if i can call this a failure, but holy shit. pun not intended. or maybe it was. lessons learned: don't stray far from a bathroom, and don't trust a fart. i don't know if this can be counted as a tifu because i achieved my intended result, but it definitely took me by surprise! tldr; i took waaaaaay too much miralax and now i have to stay within 30 feet of a toilet at all times. however, i will be squeaky clean for my next sexual escapade	üòÅ
other than spirited away, what's your favorite miyazaki film and why? i really like the secret world of arriety. i think it has some of the best music, and i really love the attention to detail of the big world vs small. the sound design is just fantastic throughout, the first time arriety steps into the kitchen gives me chills, and the ticking of the clock shifting to the beating heart. i also like how magical it feels yet is devoid of anything super natural. its as if it could be a real story that actually happened. it seems to take place in the real world. i also feel it captures those powerful and epic themes that you often find in miyazaki films, death, adventure, coming of age, having your whole world turned upside down. but its wrapped up in such a small and seemingly insignifigant package. if you really put yourself into the headspace of the two main characters, and think of what their outlook on the world must be like and listen to all the little details of their backstory and dialog. everything just fits into place and becomes so richer, the whole movie just gives so much detail on perspective and how drastically different things can seem when you put yourself into another persons shoes. (feel free to talk about spirited away, but i dont even think ive met someone who didnt say that was their favorite. )	üòä

i'm in the middle of a mental breakdown so basically we were outside doing stuff on the roof n i was told to throw a rope up, like wtf i can't throw for shit. my mums boyfriend was telling me how, n i tried n i couldn't get it, he insisted that i keep trying but my brother was in a rush since he has class soon. n i just kept telling him to do it since i can't. n honestly i almost snapped n said, 'well i don't know how to do this, i never had, i never had a fucking father around to show me how to do it, so i'm sooo sorry i fucking cant.' luckily i didn't but now i'm inside laying in bed crying about never having a father. so really good day so far.	üôÉ
how to respond to people spreading crap about you? just after some quick advice regarding how to respond in general to backbiting/slander that you hear about yourself. there have been just a couple of occasions throughout the past few years where people have misunderstood something i said/did and shared their wrong impression of me to others. also times when people have assumed things and shared them. and also times when people have made up outright lies and shared them. resulting in other people turning away from me and/or continuing to spread the backbiting and slander. if i defend myself it makes me look guilty. if i don't defend myself it makes me look guilty. if i tell them politely that i'm upset about what they've done to me, i get ignored or threatened. if i confront someone politely about their behaviour by telling them what they've done to me and that i forgive them and that i want to know why it's happened, i get gaslighted or called a liar, and told it's all my fault and that they're innocent. they don't allow me to defend myself, as if they're superior to me and know me better than i know myself, as if i don't have rights and they're in charge of what is said about me no matter what damage is done. as if they're committed to misunderstanding me, either out of refusal to be proven wrong or because they believe the wrong ideas with a passion or perhaps there's another motive. but it's all very strange. it's literally a never ending saga where no matter how kind i am to people and help them, people take my quietness and kindness for weakness and think they can do whatever they like to me. if i react i cop it harder. if i don't react they think they're in the right and i still cop it harder. what exasperates the issue further is that severe social anxiety is the reason for my quietness however it's extreme quietness that some people find offputting and weird. so basically it's easy to believe anything weird you hear about a weird looking person, because it's obviously true right?!! my reputation in the town i live in has been obliterated. god knows that i'm not the type of person that i have been portrayed as. i have done everything possible to try remedying the situation including been patient, apologising for things i've never done, tried keeping away from people, tried warming up to people, everything. i have treated those who hurt me with so much politeness and respect in the face of what they did to me and they continue to throttle my reputation. i don't know what to do. i've literally lost the battle and they've won. anything i can do until then to remove the emotional and mental agony that has evolved into feeling physically unwell at times as well?	üôÑ

im at a crossroads with my career i wouldn't exactly call working in food service a "career". it was a series of jobs that turned into a career for me after i dropped out of college due to family instability and becoming homeless. i lived in the college town for about 9 years, working a lot and trying to get ahead. it wasn't until i was 24 that i found a really good management position with a company that i could grow with. my boss and i talked about getting me certified as a chef but things in my personal life took a turn. i don't want to make everyone read my whole life but the gist of it was i choose a very poor relationship to be in. for 6 years. i was very codependent and basically a shell of a person. i decided to leave the relationship and moved out. things changed a lot after this happened. i was still working my mgmt position but i was learning to be me and just be happy by myself. working my kitchen positions was my escape from a lot of things in my life. once i left my ex i was second guessing the thought of being a chef. it got to the point of just wanting to leave the whole industry. i moved out of the town, out of state to be with my partner when i was 27. life is great now. i hate working . i know we all do but after working to get away from life i'm ready to do the opposite. art studio was going to be my major when i was enrolled. i'm a traditional artist, computers are my nemisis and would love to learn more. i've been tossing the idea of going to a local community college for my associates. i guess i'm scared to take in all that debt and not finding a job. will i find the training i'm looking for? is it worth it? tldr: i've been thinking of going to community college for an associate degree in art after working 12 years in the food service industry. feeling apprehensive. any similar stories to share or advice?	üòÇ

help onto being a student body official so, bit of context, i am an honor student at my school (yes honor, one of the big graded students etc) without even trying. now, because of my good reputation, i have always been elected as an official in the classroom (just stressing this out). however, just yesterday (as of this post) i got included in the ssg (supreme student government) without personal volition. i am very inexperienced in being an official. so for those who want to give me tips, i would appreciate it .	üòä

trials and tribulations this is just me writing down what been on my mind. i haven't posted in a while and this is just reminder to myself and all of you to stay strong. 9 months. it's been 9 months without my dad. i'm about to graduate and i feel so many different emotions. time has really helped, but i'll never forget. never. during the first week after his death, i couldn't even fathom living a "normal" life. but life goes on. your close friends slowly start to forget what happened and his death becomes this distant memory. i've been surprised at how well i've handled it, or maybe i'm in for some emotional break down. maybe i've changed in subtle ways that i won't notice for years, which scares me so much. my mom and i have the strongest bond, but i feel like people around me are hurting more than i am. sometimes i feel like i fail to recognize that. i don't know what my little sisters think. did they forget? do they still hurt? do they need their big brother? they are the ones who found him, and i still can't imagine the trauma of seeing his body just hanging there. all cold and lifeless. makes me sick. i still sleep across his room. i still have to go into his room to lower the ac at night. honestly the first month felt like a different life. i feel like i was so vulnerable, but now i feel like i've built up callous to protect me. sometimes i feel so lonely. so minuscule. no one, and i mean no one can truly understand what impact this has on you unless you go through this shit. it's not like you just feel better and that's it. it's a slow, nagging feeling of distress and guilt that continuously gnaws away at me. but i fight it. i will never stop fighting it. i keep going for the people that i love and the bright future that i hope to have with someone that i love. it sounds cheesy but is there a purpose in this life if you don't have someone to love? we all have people that we love, and people that love us. that's why we all live to fight another day. even though some of those that we loved are now just memories in our head, we keep going because the ones who are breathing need us just as much as we need them. i really do hope i find someone to love. it provides healing in the most magnificent ways. i loved my dad and i know he loved me, but i now i must remind myself that i need to be there for my loved ones, just as much as they need to be there for me. i need that reminder sometimes because i'll go through life and begin to lose grip on what truly matters. life can be a bitch. it can chew you up and spit you out, but you learn invaluable lessons that some people may never learn in their entire life. it's up to you to do what you want with these lesson that you learn. to anyone who read this all, thank you. i truly do appreciate it. and finally, to anyone in pain just remember that there's always someone who loves you. stay strong	‚ù§Ô∏è

beauty of books the great debate of "the movie is better than the book" and vice versa, there are some things that must be addressed. i'm biased and i'm picking books and for all of us readers, this should be relatable. the beauty of a book is not just the book but our own creative thinking. we interpret the story, the characters, the plots, etc. and i love that! a movie basically builds that for you. oh, you didn't envision jay gatsby to look like brad pitt? too bad! and now, if you revisit that book, good luck not picturing the protagonist or antagonist as a hollywood a-lister. lol as well, no matter how much time is spent in between reading a particular book, when i go back the characters look the same, the houses, the town...everything looks the same as i imagined it the first time. and no two towns or characters of books look the same! it's amazing to me what our minds can do. a writer writes and our minds help create it. there is no way i could ever pick a movie over a book. movies are entertaining, yes. but a book is an entire world at your disposal any time. i prefer to get lost once in a while.	üòä
i just left my pubg whatsapp group got no one to talk to about this so i guess this could be an appropriate place? we were a full squad, and used to play on pc very often, then the mobile version came out and some friends who didn't have a pc joined the group. in less than a week the whole group stopped playing on pc and moved to mobile. i tried to like it but i just don't feel comfortable on it. so after months of denial and not playing a single game even by myself, i left the group. i loved all the games we played and it's sad that those times are gone. but there are some other things that have improved in my life since then and to be honest i wouldn't be able to keep with their amount of playing sessions	üòÖ

after great first date she (f21) doesn't write me (m25) back that much i know that it is quite stupid that i'm thinking that much about this, but we both met online and had an awesome first date. we found out that we are sharing many interests with each other. we even talked about future events where we could go together. it was a week ago and i tried to start a little bit of conversation via text, because of our shitty working times, we can't see each other in the near future. so now i'm thinking that she isn't interested in me at all because of her answers, which are always super short, and i know that she is writing with other people a lot more... so guys, am i just stupid and should stop worrying, or should i put my power in other things... i hate me so much for that tl;dr i'm overthinking my whole situation with a girl after our 1. date	üòÖ

my {21f} best friend {23m} didn't tell me that he got engaged he's been such a good friend of mine for about half of my life and i couldn't be more grateful for him. but i realized how much of a jerk he was when i had to find out from his mom that he was engaged. to a woman that i don't like. that he was with for less than a year. like, he was supposed to be my bestfriend and he couldn't even tell me that he was engaged wtf. but at the same time i can kind of see why he didn't tell me because we had a falling out last year at his birthday party because of her. she was being shady towards me and i called her out. of course he took her side so i stopped talking to him and then he apologized to me because he missed me. his mom called me around christmas and boasted about him getting engaged. i was obviously confused but i didn't tell her that because it was embarrassing that i was his bestfriend and wasn't one of the first to know. i simply just texted him and said, "your mom told me you were engaged." he called me and he was just really happy and excited like he didn't forget to tell me and then he told me that he wanted me to be his best woman. he already had a best man but he wanted me to be up there too. (he's dumb sometimes don't mind him). i just asked him how he wanted me to be a best woman at a wedding that i didn't even know about. he said that he was gonna tell me but he was caught up. i asked him how he would feel if i were to be engaged and not tell him but he just made a joke out of it. he keeps saying, "i'm not letting you get married because he's gonna take you away from me." yeah whatever. i just told him that i had something to do and then hung up. he texted me a few hours later saying that he was serious about me being in his wedding and was telling me what he wanted me to wear. i just lied and told him that i couldn't go. i don't want to be in his wedding. i don't want to be near his wife. i don't want to be near him. he's fakkkeee. a fake friend. he randomly sent me a link to that "we don't talk anymore" song and i just replied, "you're so corny lol." then he says, "i miss you " i just replied with "ohh" and then went about my day. he obviously feels guilty about not telling me because he's been sending me old pictures of us when we were younger non-stop. he's also been subtweeting me a lot, like when he posted a throwback embarrassing picture of me and then after that made a post that said "i don't think there's anything that hurts more than being abandoned by someone you were once so close to." as you can see, he's very sensitive and in touch with his emotions so i'm not surprised that he's getting married so quickly. but i wish he would've told me. he would've been one of the first to know had it been me. i don't think he's a good friend to me anymore and if i could randomly just stop talking to him, i would but he doesn't play those games. he knows how to make me feel extremely guilty into talking to him. tl;dr: my bestfriend of 9 years didn't tell me that he was engaged. i had to find out from his mom and i don't want to be friends with him anymore because that's so messed up to me	üòî
