tostitos are only good chips to eat when there's nothing to eat in the fridge i usually don't go for tostitos of given the option to pick out chips. but today i checked the fridge and there's wasn't something good enough to snack on so i see a bag of tostitos: hint of lime on my kitchen table. these are fucking delicious what the fuck don't judge a chip by it's bag	2

what's good reddit!? my hubby is in florida visiting some family! i'm bored as fuck, 7 shots into a bottle of jack. by myself. on a saturday night. fml any other lonely people on reddit rn, missing bae? let's conversate!	15
is my bf actually abusive and manipulative towards me i don't even know where to start.. iv (18f) been with my boyfriend (22m) for about 5 months now and i'm starting to get really worried and scared. i'm not sure if this this is the right place to post this but i hope it is. a little while ago i was talking to one of my friends after i had an argument with my bf and she brought to my attention that she thinks his being manipulative and abusive towards me and now i can't get it out my mind after playing things back to myself. little bit about the relationship! (sorry if this post is all over the place) when me an my boyfriend first started dating we opened up to each other about our past where we have both had a history of abuse in ex relationships and we agreed to always respect each others wishes and boundaries. as the months have progressed he has started to change into a completely person that's hard to recognise and it's starting to really scare me. nearly every single week he gets me to come to his house to stay over and be with him and such. now every single night (no exaggeration) he always always starts getting sexual with me which i usually don't mind because i do have a high sex drive. but in the past month or so there has been a few times where i haven't wanted to because i'm just about to fall asleep because it's like 1 am. so i'll tell him i don't want to have sex and that i'm too tired but it's like he doesn't hear me because he just keeps going without saying anything trying to feel me up and shit. and then climbs on top of me no matter how many times i say no he just keeps going and starts to have sex with me while i'm trying to push him off. iv even woken up a few times to him pulling my clothes off and starting to have sex with me while i'm still waking up after saying no before actually falling asleep. he pins my hands down and even if he doesn't i can't push him off i yell and cry but it's like it doesn't effect him and i can't do anything because he is so much bigger and stronger then me (he does heaps of gym) i don't know what to do. he won't take no for an answer and i can't stop him and then in morning it's like nothing happened. i'm starting to loose attraction and eelings for him i don't want to have sex with him at all anymore he scares the shit out of me. every time we have an argument it's always flipped back on to me an i'm always the one who ends up apologising and feeling like a crap person in the end even tho it's something he has done and i never realised any of this until my friend pointed everything out to me and i don't know what to do i have quite a bit of stuff at his place and i'm scared to go get it and break up with him in case he try's something. with everything that's happened iv been getting horrible anxiety just thinking of him and the relationship but i'm unsure if i'm just being a drama queen about it all or if it's actually as bad as i think it is please help any advice would be great. i'm sorry if this post is a mess. i'm too scared to read it back because just typing this post is giving me anxiety so i hope it does make sense thank you so much for reading	3

don't you just hate racists!!!! ...like as though i had a say when god was creating me. jeeezz!!! am not sure i posted this on the right sub but pardon me, still new on reddit. it's annoying, i mean really annoying when am treated differently because of the colour of my skin. i had a hard time getting into any college/ sixth-form(uk) close to my home. i had really good grades but because i am black, most of the sixth forms couldn't let me do biology, chemistry and math. they kept on giving me subjects i didn't enjoy at all. i ended up going to a college that's 2hours away. the college is really great cause dah!, it's in windsor. anyway this isn't the only encounter with racism, i face it everyday and it's friggin' annoying like today on the bus, the bus driver didn't ask for the student ids of all of my friends and the other kids on the bus but he insisted on seeing mine, like what the hell. i showed it to him anyway, i felt like opening my bag too an shoving my books down his throat. my friends noticed and i saw the look of pity on their faces and we later talked about it which ended in me crying . and other scenarios like the librarian at my college is soooo rude to me am like her mother in law or something same as to the receptionist at my dentist, she's the reason am switching a dentist though my dentist was the best i have ever had. at work the same thing. sorry to say this but the most racist things i face are from white ladies. asians are cool because they understand the struggle. recently i was at work in the manager's, (a lady)office and the assistant manager, (a guy) said. " isn't she the most beautiful girl around here, look at her skin, her eyes, she is just so beautiful," . guys, you should have seen the look on my manager's face, it was full of disgust. like how can you call a black person beautiful. the guy kept on talking till the manager changed the topic without saying anything about it. and am not saying that she's racist because she didn't comment on my beauty but you get the point racists should just know that it's really hard to be of an inferior race, it sucks everyday to know that you not wanted because of your colour. it's sucks even more because you can't change it, i was fuckin' born this way, i swear if i had the option of going back to the day i was created i would tell god to make me white. and not that i wanna be white but that way i would live a comfortable life with other life problems and my race not being one them. don't get me wrong, i like the fact that am black and i enjoy it but that's because i cannot change it, so gotta accept it and enjoy the positive side of it. and now am thinking of changing my name in the coming years cause i heard it's hard for one to get a job if the recruiter is a fuckin' racist , and am only doing that cause i want a good future. and i don't think black people are racist, they only are the way they do because they know other races already hate them. like really how can you like someone who doesn't like you.	14

my dentist just told me he is proud of me :) dental hygiene wasn't really a top priority for me, mainly because i am a careless idiot. but in the last year i started feeling the effects of all those years of not taking care of my teeth, mainly when my heart started acting funny in december and i started feeling irregular beats and palpitations, and it hit me! gum disease and heart issues go together, and that freaked the shit out of me. so last month i decided to do scaling and cleaning of my gums, teeth, getting some root canals and preparing (read: bracing ) for braces. the first thing he said when i opened my mouth "son, your gums are in a critical condition". and i just pointed at one of the posters in his cabinet and said when i'm done, i want teeth just like those. fast forward a month later i went back for a checkup and he said "your teeth and gum are in a pristine condition right now, i'm really proud of you and i can see your hygiene is really on point", this compliment doesnt seem like much, but it meant a lot to me because i can't remember the last time someone told me they are proud of me, and now that it's about my teeth, something i'm very insecure about, it got me pumped up and taking hygiene more seriously. flossing and brushing have become a daily ritual right now. what about you folks? when was the last time someone told you they are proud of you?	9

possibly giving myself a concussion today was supposed to be a productive day. i felt decent this morning even though i only got four hours of sleep (mistake number one was not going back to bed at that point). instead, i slugged down an energy drink and got to work cleaning the house. hours later i was definitely feeling the effects of short-changing myself on sleep. i was starting to drag but figured i could make it through the day and just make it up that night by getting extra sleep. so there i was, juggling loads of laundry, dusting ceilings, washing dishes, scrubbing the bathroom - for some reason i had *everything* on my list to clean today. halfway through the day i noticed with dismay that i wasn't making nearly as much headway on said list as i would have liked - because i was freaking exhausted and crawling through tasks at this point with the speed of a drugged turtle. so what do i do? nap and do some of it tomorrow? oh no, that would have been the logical and sensible solution. instead, i decide to crack open another energy drink (mistake number two). i mean, it worked, so there is that. it perks me right up and i start cleaning out the fridge. i've got music playing on my phone and i'm singing along with it rather enthusiastically. all is well, except i'm pretty jittery at this point from all the caffeine - because i'm also drinking my way through most of a two-liter of diet mountain dew along with these monsters. i know, not the best decision ever. anyway, i decide to crouch down in front of the fridge to finish cleaning it out. that done, i went to stand up and pretty much leaped up full force, chock-full of excess energy from so much caffeine. a second later i find myself on the floor actually seeing stars. i'd cracked my head *hard* on the underside of the freezer door handle when i jumped to my feet (the fridge door was still open at this point so my head was in the perfect spot for this mini disaster). apparently while jumping up i was moving way faster than i realized, because i now have a giant lump on my head and a headache way worse than the nasty tension headaches i deal with daily. on top of that, all of the muscles in my neck and down into my shoulders seem to instantly get some sort of whiplash effect from this whack on the head and they all scream in protest and begin hurting. i can't even form coherent sentences for a minute or two so i just end up squawking out a few almost-words while curled up in pain on the floor. to add insult to injury, when i'm able to sit up i notice that my cat is watching all of this unfold with a decidedly judgmental look on his face. probably labeling me as an idiot in his head. so i get myself together enough to stand up and open the freezer and dazedly grab a bag of peas. i plop it on my head and immediately decide that it hurts worse that way, but i leave it on my head anyway. but not for long, because now i feel like i'm going to puke and my head is throbbing so badly i can't even think straight. i end up in bed (oh the irony) and decide for some reason that it makes perfect sense to take a picture of the top of my head so i can see how bad the lump is. i take and look at *five* separate pictures before i finally realize that my hair is too thick for me to see much of anything besides...hair. so eventually i give up on that. at this point i just want to sleep. i'm exhausted, in pain, and on the verge of throwing up. so of course i can't sleep no matter how much i try. i pop an 800 ibuprofen and pray it helps (and later read on a random website that ibuprofen isn't recommended for concussion pain). of course, at this point i haven't quite yet realized that i might have a concussion. i figured i hadn't knocked myself out so that meant i was good on the concussion front (also wrong as i later found out). so i spend who knows how long in bed just trying to sleep, trying not to puke, with this sad little half a bag of rapidly-thawing peas on my head again to try and make the lump go away. i manage to message my so at some point during this attempted nap to share my tale of misery. i assure him i will be fine, so he doesn't come home but he checks up on me throughout the day just in case. i finally give up on sleep, get back up, and trudge through some more of my to-do list. because you know, of course for some reason i think *that's* a good idea at this point . so eventually gets home from work and asks how my head is. i gingerly feel my head to see if the lump is any smaller. it is, but touching it also intensifies my headache and muscle aches, neither of which have gotten any better all day despite taking the 800 earlier and two tylenol at some point after that. so now it's 1 a.m., i'm so tired i can't sleep (as if that makes any sense at all), my head is simultaneously throbbing and feeling like someone is crushing it in a vise, my neck and shoulder muscles are knotted up something fierce, i'm still nauseous, my entire body aches from sheer exhaustion, and i have to be up early in the morning to let a repairman into the house. one of my muscle relaxers might do the trick to knock me out, but getting one from the medicine cabinet right now is way too much effort to even consider. tl:dr - drank way too much caffeine today, whacked my head on the freezer door handle by standing up underneath it, gave myself a nice lump on the head. and maybe a concussion to go along with it. or not, who knows. fingers crossed for "not".	11

my (21m) and her (21f) slow-to-build relationship i just want to ask for others experiences/advice for dealing with slow beginning relationships. specifically, long distance relationship. a close person in my life and i found to share affection for each other, and a couple days agreed to move forward. she's had violently traumatic relationships in the past, and she's explained she's slow to open when it comes to love. this contrasts my immature romantic side that kind of wants to kiss and avoid responsibility all day. i know romance can also be mature, but you get my point. the fact that it's long distance puts an extra strain on us. does anyone have any wisdom as to how to move forward best? thanks tl;dr - what's the wisest way to work on a slow-to-build relationship while keeping some romance?	3

not taking out my trash and my housemates stumbling across my fleshlight. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck i really need to get this off my chest because i am insanely embarrassed and i don't know who to tell and this is a good place for this kinda sht idk ok so some background so y'all can "sympathize" for my dumbass loll : i was going thru some crap post-break up and yo boi is not in the shape to be seeing anyone. my perverted ass thought it would be a good idea to get one and didn't realize they were annoying to maintain. i eventually got fed up with it and decided to toss it but i only did so into my own waste bin. this is the moment i'll regret forever: when i was cleaning my room, my lazy ass didn't toss the actual bag into the trashcan but left it out... this morning i was in a rush to get to work and forgot to take it out -________- when i got back i think my housemate's dog might've gotten into the bag or something because the damn fleshlight was just sitting out on the kitchen floor ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i hate myself so much rn i just wanna die lmao tl;dr : should've just threw my trash away properly because dog got into it and now the house and friends know my deep dark secret	12

we (24f/24m) only see each other once a week after 2-3 months of dating - shouldn't we see each other more often? we (24f/24m) only see each other once a week and have been dating exclusively for 2 months with a total of 3. we live in different cities which are only 30 mins away but i don't have a car which means it's 2.5 hrs away for me. we've formed a recent routine where i'll bus to a train station which is only an hour away and he will pick me up. we do this once a week, midweek, and i stay over. we both go back to our home towns (not that far) on the weekends and both, especially him lead busy lives. it has been like this for most of our time dating because he bought a new house, fixed it up and moved in. i'd mentioned i'd like to see him more and it has improved since because the house is more or less set up and because we formed the once a week routine. he's a planner and when his mind is on something, he really focuses on it while i'm more relaxed. so he schedules ahead and and books his weekends up with errands, plans and things he needs to get done. it's hard for him to deviate from his schedule especially for important things like extra work from his job, errands and etc. he's also very ambitious with work and is taking an online course on the side. i start to miss him and sometimes feel a disconnect. especially when he has a night in, where he is just chilling and we could have hung out. and recently i've been thinking as if he should be able to fit me in for twice a week if he tried. online advice is always saying that if he liked you enough, he'd make time. which while sounds crappy, it's got me wondering. if he says he misses me, why doesn't he try harder to see me? or does he not mean what he says?? especially because i am more relaxed and i can move things around in my schedule to try and see him. so i don't know if this is also because we are different types of people? when we spend time together, once again because of the person he is, his focus is me. and all these issues almost feel non-existent because he's so attentive and thoughtful regarding me. and we text everyday. i feel like i'm nagging him if i say i'll like to see you more and now i'm always scared of asking him to do something in case he says no which is starting to feel crappy. i just think we could progress more into relationship-ville better and stronger if we saw each other more. so here i am, looking for someone to tell me to chill, stop overthinking and reading bad advice because once a week is good or is this something to be worried about? a red flag? p.s. he is my first real person i'm dating for this long - i got into the scene late and don't know how it really works p.s. anxiety prone p.s. he's also about to jet off on a vacation for 2.5 weeks, which is also triggering this. and i'm scared the "disconnect" will grow even more. also because he couldn't see me today because of errands and the superbowl ( ). tldr; dating for 2 months exclusively, he's a busy person so we only see each other once a week. i feel as though we should see each other more. it feels crappy when he has to say no to plans with me when i ask. starting to feel like he can put more effort in to see me but isn't because he doesn't like me enough. i also think we could progress a lot more in a proper relationship type of thing faster if we saw each other more. is it a red flag? or am i over thinking and once a week isn't really bad (i'm the red flag lolol).	11

a goofy relationship story about soap so this is kind of dumb and cheesy but i don't have many friends i really wanted to tell someone. my partner and i have been together for over a year now and one day we were looking at my snapchat and i was watching one of those oddly satisfying stories and there was soap cutting. i, personally, am not a huge fan of soap cutting, but he saw one where they cut the soap and instead of tipping it over so all the little shavings fell, they scraped them off with the blade they used. he found tingle heaven. so now everyday i watch those stories (i'm now subscribed to three or four) to try to find the rare ones where they scrape the shavings off just to send them to him so he doesn't have to sit through the ones he doesn't like. i know it's cheesy and goofy but i just wanted to tell someone. thanks for reading	8
i somehow wound up living my dream two years ago after graduating from an advanced diploma in graphic design and finding myself in an agency job i loathed, i decided to go back to school to learn software development. now i'm working at my dream job, as a dev, i just got a raise out of nowhere and they seem to really love the work i'm putting in. it feels great because everyday i'm excited to wake up and go to work because i absolutely love the work i do and i love solving these code problems and learning new things every single day. it's crazy how life works out. i'm so happy i decided to follow my heart and go back to school to get an education in something i was really interested in it's never too late to follow your dreams!	3

for everyone.. this year has been quite shit for everyone. to the people who have lost loved ones: hold on to those memories, use those emotions to keep going, we have to face the hard truth that they are not going to come back but trust me over time you will learn to except this. i'm not saying the pain will every fully go away but at some point you have to let go to the people with friends struggling: check in with them, if you know what people are going through and they trust you enough to tell you, use that information to try and change that. you can be that one person that can make them reconsider something in there life, sometimes all they need is someone who cares, someone who can just listen. to the people that know no one struggling: look around, at your friends, family, co workers. the people you least expect always have something going on. ask the friend that seems to have it all together, ask the friend who doesn't talk to much, ask the friend who is often home alone, ask the friend who looks like they have pain in there eyes. to the people that are struggling themselves: reach out, there's always someone who will listen and genuinely care about you and if you can't think of any i'm sure that someone in this sub would be more then happy to listen, you're not alone. so many people are silently drowning, to scared to spill there emotions to other people, to scared of what would happen if they did, you brain won't let you see how bad something is getting. if you can't figure out how to help yourself, help others, be there for someone just like you want there to be someone for you to the people who are suicidal: even if you feel like you don't have a reason to live, use those emotions and feelings to push other people that need it then eventually u might learn to help yourself to. as someone who covers most of these, i want to exist for other people, i don't really care abt myself (idk if that's a good thing ) but if you read this it means nothing without doing something and ik not many will see this but if i can change one persons outlook that's all that matters	7

fantasy / sci-fi quick reads? hi guys, i'm an avid reader that is currently working and doing university, both full-time and fixing up a house with the husband on the weekends, possibly not the wisest choice. anyway, i don't have much downtime at the moment but am really missing reading for pleasure. looking for somethings that i can pick up and put down quickly. i've already read robot dreams and the short stories collaborative collection called rogues, looking for similar stuff. any suggestions? thanks.	10

i think my father wants to keep me in a cage. everytime i keep telling him that i will study outside, he just listens to me and doesn't comment. it's like he wants to keep me under his control. even my mother keeps convincing him that he has to start moving (process visas and other documents) he just says we still have time. when time passes by, he will then tell us that there is no more time. last year, my mother and i wanted to travel to a european country (we haven't traveled outside in more than a decade), my dad said he would process the visas. so we waited for a month to see what would happen. we had dinner that evening and we asked him about progress. he said that it was too late to apply for the visas. my mother cried and didn't even eat dinner with us so she went to her room. my dad got pissed about her crying and just left the house after eating and praying. i really want to go to the uk, i have an amazing life ahead of me and my father is blockading me from achieving it. he keeps telling me that i will study here and get a car immediately. fuck the car. i want to also note that, every fucking time i ask him that me and my mother want to travel outside, he would suggest that we visit a third world country as a joke. i am not discriminating or expressing hate towards poor nations, but my father knows that we will decline traveling to a less developed nation for vacation. he even smiles when he jokes around. for example: "dad, me and mom wanna travel. just the two of us, because we know you're busy with work." "where? 'less developed country?' " who do i seek help from if my father doesn't do anything? this is my last year as a high school student, and i don't know where my future will be headed towards. if i stay here, i am guaranteed to be a slave to my father and his step wife's family (they inherit most of the wealth due to the red book) if i end up staying here to study, should i face him with my fists? i apologize for my grammar and if this is the wrong sub to post.	1

playing anime at work and making everyone think i'm watching hentai alright, hear me out. i work at a tourist attraction and our breakroom is located in a secret hall away from the view of a guests. we duck through a semi hidden door to a central corridor that leads to the employee br, lockers and breakroom. however, there are no doors on the break room. i finished my lunch and we have 45 min breaks, so i thought i could finish an episode of shokugeki no soma before heading back to work. as i was working earlier my phone was on vibrate and i recently switched from a razer phone to an s10+. my razer phone mutes all sound when on vibrate and turns out my s10+ does not. i launched crunchy roll and my video resumed from this morning, and i had left off right before a tasting montage. for any of you who don't watch the show, every time they taste something they have a foodgasm with moaning and all that shit, i'll link an example. link: nsfw <url> as i play the episode, that scene starts playing at full fucking volume. everyone fucking looks at me [an asian teenager] with a wtf face. at this point i'm really embarrased and i'm in the bathroom typing this out . note to self, watch all subtitled anime with earbuds from now on, especially in public. tl;dr am asian, watched anime at work in breakroom, nsfw scene plays at full volume in front of coworkers, fuck.	9

i was a dumb 22 going on 23 y-o m hi reddiotrs. im ready for the hate. im ready for the crucifixions. as the title says... my last relationship was was a considerable amount of time ago. im now a hair away from 27 and am finally ready to meet people again. i like to think i've grown, matured, and gained a bit of direction since then, which is what i promised and looked forward to. well... here it its... i knew how i felt early in this one. also. i never felt that way about any one else id ever had interest in. i tried to express myself without sounding desparate or creepy. i have a past with depression anxiety and addictions, though at that time i wasnt spiraling in the addiction aspect at that moment. we were college students, we had a 5 week christmas break which made us long distance early on, her without a car and all that yada sort of made it hard to see each other. i also did not get re-hired at my summer job, she did, so she worked almost every day of that break. i tried (maybe a little too hard) to keep texting, talking, showing interest. hell i lost count of how many times i asked her when i could drive out there to see her. i missed her so much i couldnt stand it. probably came off as needy. i even tried to exterminate some of my bad habits i knew she wasnt crazy about. that was going well. just not the anxiety and irrationality it caused. it didnt make me get angry or cry, just made me sound needy with all the overthought out questions. possibly impatient as well. also. she was only my second gf ever. so i felt like i had no idea how to go about anything. i was never meaning to seem selfish for wanting to see her or talk. we have talked it out since and we're cool with each other. i was honestly just genuinely interested in being a positive part of her life and growing with her. i think i can manage, but any advice from people that know what they're doing would be much appreciated. sorry its so long... isnt every dating story... thanks reddit... i think...	0
i'm happy. today i took a big step for myself. for a number of reasons, i've never felt like me with the name i was born with, but i was always too terrified to tell my father i intended to legally change it. that's always been my problem, i probably got it from my mother - she's the same way; we're far too worried about the happiness of those around us and never worried enough about our own. but today i did it. i confronted my dad and told him about my intentions to do so and it actually went well. we've never really had a great relationship so i was scared he'd freak out a bit, after all identity is something that is still confusing for a lot of people, especially the older generations. for once in a very long time, i'm happy with who i am and i'm very excited to know that in a little around a months time, i'll finally be who i've always been.	8
i want.. goth gf who 1. spits in my mouth 2. crushes me with their thighs is that too much to ask for	13
i fell in love with a special ed jew. so, i met this man on tinder. initially he told me he's not looking for dating or relationships. right there and then, i should've been like okbye. well, because i'm someone whose very straightforward. seriously looking for a relationship, however i also desperately needed someone to talk to at that time, so i decided to let loose a bit and be like okay fine let's be friends (we were connecting really well) he's handsome, really freaking tall, literally the embodiment of what i consider my dream guy. his personality brings me life, seriously. we begin texting endlessly like 24/7 getting to know each other. we finally meet, and i swear i fell the moment i saw him. he's perfect to me, in every way possible. it's like a scene from one of those stupid dumb romantic movies, yeah. well anyway, i thought "oh, maybe we can be friends now, but who knows where that could lead to..." i'm delusional, okay. soooooo......later on as we're getting closer, he tells me that he's special ed, and has never been in a relationship before. also, he's jewish. h u g e emphasis on that. we come from very different religious backgrounds okay. i don't have a problem with any of that, but he seems to be the one that holds back 10000% right there and then, i'm like... okay. i need to stop talking to him. why though? just remain friends and chill out girl. the problem is....(one year later) and now i'm in love with him. do you know how much it hurts to be in love with someone that you know you'll never be with? i know for a fact, believe me. it's a new year. and i really think it's time that i move on and let this go. i am so exhausted and tired of playing this "cat and mouse" game, it'll never go anywhere. maybe i'm selfish that i want to be with him romantically. i don't know. i feel like it's time for me to get away from him, because the feelings are intense. i've never felt this way about someone before. the push and pull is so strong though. i feel like it's too hard for me to let go now, but it also hurts. all of this could've been avoided if i just made the smart choice to move on and seek what i was actually seeking in the first place. it sucks now, dating life sucks. every other man i met does not at all compare to him. i don't feel interested in any other normal guy. he's literally the only man i've been talking to for a year now.... i mean okay i talk to other guys every now and then but it ends quickly. wtf do i do? seriously need advice, because clearly i make allll the worst decisions.	4

boyfriend m/22 reacted badly to period sex f/21 had sex with my boyfriend last week and can't stop thinking about what happened. we're adults and have been dating for over a year. i had been spotting slightly and he was aware of this. my cramps were really bad but he initiated sex and i went along with it, to please him and also i know it can relive cramps. note this was in the morning, i had not yet had the chance to have a shower so anyone who has a period...knows things aren't the most pleasant especially if it's the end of your period. after he finished he almost immediately made a comment about how towards the end it really smelt. i had previously explained i didn't want oral because of my period and told him that was why and he explained how he would have thrown up if he'd have done that etc. there was also a bit of blood on my stomach and he asked where it was from (i know.. ) and i explained i let him wipe his fingers there instead of on the bed sheets (so he didn't have stained sheets) and he looked disgusted after he realised he could have blood on his fingers and started checking everywhere. after this i just feel mortified about myself and i'm so embarrassed, i can't help the smell that comes with the last few days of your period and i did suggest a shower before. i don't know if i'm overreacting and should just take it on the chin and it's how guys are? i feel disgusting tldr: boyfriend reacted badly to period sex	1

(22m) not sure if i should ask (32f) to be fwb hello reddit, i'm a 22 years old male. about 4 months ago i made out with a 32 years old woman (alcohol was involved), who has two kids but doesn't live with her partner anymore. we have known each other for a while before the night, as we both frequent the same bar. we texted for a few days after that night and it was pretty obvious she wanted to become fwb. i was dealing with a lot of personal issues at the time so i made it clear i enjoyed the night, but wasn't interested in going further and we stopped talking. now that i took care of the stuff in my life i'd kinda be up for the fwb relationship, but it'd be weird if i started texting her now? another thing is, the girl is best friends with the bartender of the bar we frequent (who i'm also good friends with) and i'm worried i could create a shitstorm in my social circle. i know for sure that the woman in question is still single and i think she'd still be interested in being fwb. you must be thinking i'm an idiot, but i have never had a fwb so i'm not quite sure how these things work also sorry for any grammar mistakes, i'm not a native speaker. tl;dr: made out with an older chick, stopped talking, now i'd be up for fwb	19
i'm deleting my account in one hour, here's why. in one hour i'll delete all my social media. i've waisted so much time on this site, playing games, and other social media, and i just had a realization that it's not worth it anymore. i've missed out on so much and there's really no real life reward for doing anything in social media(unless you're famous which i am not ). reddit isn't all bad, i love this site so much and i've met so many cool people on here. but anyway, peace out from u/tylerjacobs44	1

and wrote "you mama gai" in the wrong place. so yeah guys, it's midnight, so imma just say this happened esterday, but i was logging into this "console8" application so i could take my microsoft tech associate fundamentals thing for software development and there's a space for the proctor to login. so as i was waiting, i goofed off and just wrote some stuff in the username section. i got the splendid idea of writing "you mama gai" verbatim, so i did, but i forgot to take it off, so when the teacher came over to put his info on, he saw it and said "what?" and i'm like : "uhhhhh nothing lemme delete that real quick". luckily, i didn't replace it with something worse (yes i had that idea). i'm going to save your eyes though. i'm so pleased i didn't write *that* down. tl;dr so i wrote down something i shouldn't. the teacher made some confused noises, but it all turned out ok. and i passed	18

i'm happy. for the first time in a while, i'm genuinely happy. things couldn't have been better this year. i won't go into detail but last month, i passed everything related to driving in the 1st try, from the theory tests, first aid tests and driving itself. i got into a great college where i met some really cool people, and tonight i'm going out with one of the girls from the college. she's a different major and the same year as me, but has the same courses/lectures like i do so i felt like i shouldn't just suppress my feelings (how cliche ) and while i didn't tell her the whole thing, i just asked her to go out with me tonight and she happily said yes so yeah. hopefully i don't mess it up somehow ha.	8
does she (15f) like me (15m) or am i just a friend? background i (15m) have a crush on this girl (15f) friend zoned: to be or not to be, that is the question --------------------pros------------------ * we're friends * she calls me a lot (typically late at night) * calls last from 40 minutes to 2 hours and 10 minutes (average around 1 hour) * snaps me during school with the exception of 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th periods * i became her snapchat #1 bff * she has social anxiety but is very open to me * sometimes i catch her look at me but then she looks away * she asked me to pick out her new nails * she usually isn't the one to end conversations * usually responds within a few minutes * shares her interests with me * is comfortable around me * tried to invite me to a party but we both ended up not going for unrelated reasons * stays up late talking to me * she will send me snaps of her with a kissy face/puckered lips * sometimes she will try to send snaps that make her look cute * she said "i literally love you" * called me a snack * called me a full course meal * her friend thinks she likes me * she smiles at me and blushes --------------------cons------------------ * she tried to match make me twice both times i didn't cooperate * she denied liking me last year after i stated that her friend said i did. (i am unsure if she was nervous or not) * i asked her out to the zoo but she tried to bring her friend and we ended up not going * she has other male friends * at track she smiled and waved at someone it might of been her brother but i think that would be kinda weird tldr: there are a lot of promising signs that this girl is giving me but there are also some negative ones and i don't know what she wants us to be.	3

i just drove a boat for the first time today hello all! i'm a biological technician at a private company, and i just drove the company boat for the whole day for the first time (two other times i just took control between transects). it was really stressful most of the time because i was poorly judging how much i needed to push forward or back on the throttle, and our transects have five points across the river that we should get as close as we can to (to survey for submerged aquatic vegetation). i hit docks a few times. i forgot to raise the motor a few times. i struggled to get the boat back onto the trailer. there were two other coworkers with me who have a bit more experience, but i was actually glad they didn't take the wheel. learning is an experience! we also used a different system of recording data, and there were struggles with that too. as a consolation prize, we also got to watch dolphins hunt! one dolphin would chase the fish to the other dolphins who would fling their faces up and out of the water. it was great! soon, we should find manatees (and less tannic water) too.	6

i finally cut off a toxic person for some backstory, ive known this girl for 4 years and she was kind of the only person i hung out with for those 4 years. but after getting some new and better friends i see that she wasn't that good for me. she would never text first, didnt ask how i was, didnt care about her future. it was very hard but im proud of myself, i never thought i would do this and im glad i finally worked up the courage to do it. thats all thanks for reading	6
how i got shit all over myself this morning oh, hi. i have a story you're gonna love. it's about how i accidentally smeared shit all over myself this morning. i woke up super early with the urgent need to poop due to eating half a pizza and half a box of oreos last night. i sit on the toilet, and on the ground i see a tiny little bug, so i squish it with a kleenex. oddly enough there is no dead bug on the ground, and no dead bug on the kleenex. whatever! i proceed to have explosive diarrhea. fast forward to wiping time. as i go to wipe my ass, mid-wipe i look down.... there is the bug on my leg it stealth climbed up me and is now running around on me in a panic. in this moment, i instantly forget i am wiping explosive munchies poops off myself, and my hands start flailing to smack the bug off of me. with dirty toilet paper in hand. and that, people of reddit, is how i ended up with shit all over myself this morning. thanks for coming to my ted talk. tl;dr - bug scared me, poo everywhere.	12
the logical decision vs id want struggle? i will just say i've already made this decision, but i was wondering if anyone else has the struggle of choosing the logical choice/answer/decision, over their primal id wants chance/answer/decision. this morning i faced the 'should i wear my cute-make-butt-look-nice-shorts even though it's cold-ish weather? or just accept that it's pants day?' decision. i realise logically, that's it's possibly too cool out to wear my shorts, but they're cute and need to be worn one more time before i can throw them in the wash with good conscience. i realised as i was considering my options that maybe i put too much thought into it	1
recently had surgery. i want to whine about my surgery, but not get on my friends/family members nerves so i'll spill my guts here. i was completely fine with the surgery happening because i had no idea what to expect. when i got there though and started getting poked i became nervous. i loved my nurses and the staff that worked with me. they could probably tell i was nervous and did great explaining everything. i thought it was funny when i told them it takes a lot of meds to knock me out. i was awake and talking to them all the way back to the operating room. i was loopy at this point, but they let me push something that they told me would "knock my ass out" and i fell asleep right after. i woke up after everything was done, and kept thanking the nurses and telling them (even the men) that they were pretty. i have a fear of taking pills and opioids because of family addiction, so i told them i would be fine without medicine. they gave me a prescription just in case. i lasted two days before i couldn't take it, and then only took half of one. i can feel the pins in my hand which is weird but not horribly painful. i can barley move that hand right now which is frustrating. i can't do my hair, or certain things by myself which kills me. my hair is important to me (insecurity issues and not being able to dress up or look nice gives me anxiety) and not even being able to straighten it sucks. i'm getting sick of sitting at home now. i like to be alone, but not for days especially when i can't take care of myself. i'm nervous about college classes with me not being able to write. the pain is still pretty bad too. sorry for the rant	1
aye i need some help yall this is probably the worst place to ask for advice but fuck it. to keep it short and simple, i fucked up major and racked up too many unexcused absences due to not joining video calls. it's a fuck up on my part due to me either oversleeping, or suffering internet problems and not saying anything to my teachers. my grades are great, i just racked up to many. my state takes this shit seriously and can withhold my credit and graduation for this. and if my mom finds out she's probably gonna kill me. i planned on emailing the school myself from her account and simply coming up with some random reasons to get these excused, is this a good idea or should i just take the l and tell her and let her handle it? i'm honestly keen on doing this myself though. this online school stuff is trash	2

unsure of how to proceed and whether to stay in my (f27) relationship with my boyfriend (m38) hey, reddit! i'm having a little bit of trouble with a long-distance relationship (he lives a three hour drive away) over how to proceed and would like some insight from those who are outside of the situation! i have been with my current boyfriend for a year and a half. we started as friends, and it was never something i intended to happen, yet here we are. he isn't my obvious type. older than me, a little heavier set. a 'normal' kind, good guy. for the first year of our relationship, things were lovely! sex was frequent, i found him lovely and that was that. after the new relationship phase started to dim down, his flaws started to grate on me increasingly so. he's very messy, doesn't work out, didn't (he does a better job now) look after himself very well- he'd show off his butt in public with ill fitting pants and so on, and i've grown up around taking lots of pride in your appearance, which i realise can be a flaw in itself. he has a fear of heights, planes, boats; won't travel on trains. he's had to leave me half way up buildings and return downstairs and wait for me. all of these things frustrate me as they involve areas of life that i love, as i adore travelling and exploring the world. he is in the position of moving soon to a new job a little closer to where i currently live, and i am going through major surgery in a month, and upon recovery, after about 6-9 months want to return to a previous job overseas for a few years, returning for time off every 6 months for about 2 months (we would be unable to talk for very long periods of time) - he said he wouldn't stop me and would still be here when i got back. he's lovely, kind, buys me small gifts like candles (i adore candles!) from time to time when i'm down. we haven't had sex now in about 8 months because i'm finding myself really unattracted to him, but still have love for him. i don't know if i can say that i am in love with him or not, and i've tried to end this relationship a couple of times already, to which he promises to change or give him another chance and i have, hence here we are. do i stay with a man who i'm finding i see as a companion, is wonderfully kind, good, good looking and generally a lovely person, but find lacking sexual attraction towards and frustration at the things that i would want us to do together, but he outright denies he will ever fix and aren't that big of a deal? i've found myself looking at him, confused over my feelings that i might not find someone as lovely as him and are these issues not really that bad? i'm a social person at times, like to chat and play video games with friends, hang out at restaurants and with family. he's better at one on one and doesn't take well to being invited to join my friends or family to a video game or dinner out, and if he does he will only really talk to me and unintentionally often ignore others when being spoken to. we've both been cooling off on each other a little lately; myself first due to these feelings i'm having and him following suit, due to my actions i assume (understandably) - we recently saw each other and there was no intimacy or show of affection from either of us, and prior to that texts and calls have been short and few and far between but he seemed relatively normal, talking about being to come see me after he moves to his new job and so on, but when we do speak it's all pretty normal! i hope this doesn't come off as shallow, and i am aware that looks and sexual attraction aren't everything, but i'd really appreciate some outside opinions here. thank you!! tl;dr - boyfriend is lovely, but lots of issues including lack of sex, sexual attractions and some of his fears are setting me back and doubting the future of our relationship.	8

me (30f) confused with this guy (30m) i know this sounds so stupid lol i got attached to this guy i haven't even met him in real life , he's in ca i'm in il, we constantly text and chat, play games online, we've been talking for a year now. i just found out he has fwb over there and the girl is in love with him, the thing is i know i'm not in the position to get jealous or anything since i haven't met him yet but have grown deeply attached lol just yesterday we had a huge fight and i started asking him who am i to him. if i'm just a girl he met online or does he even consider me as a friend?? he said "i considered you more than a friend" o.o i was so surprised hearing that from him. although i shouldn't have believed that but idk why it hits me. him and her are seeing every now and then but i dont think they're in a relationship though the girl is very possessive and clingy. i don't know what to do i dont wanna ruin what they have but at the same time wondering why would he play with peoples feelings. if he is serious with the girl he$ fking why bother with me and pretend like i mean something to him. every time the girl post something on his wall on fb he totally ignore it yet makes a reaction on her statuses . have i done something wrong? by entering the scene? lol he wants me to go see him, such a gentleman right? i'm thinking were old enough to play cats and dogs yet here i am involving myself with it. does that make me the villain. why would some man play around knowing him particularly are dealing with 2 wonderful women . why do i even bother myself with this nonsense lol. is it possible he could have feelings for us both? or it's just simply lust why not make her,his gf tho, why hide that. some men tho are just poly in nature.. it's weird how i cant just shake how i feel for this dude hes not even worth it obviously. someone throw water on me! so i'll wake up! tl;dr i got attached to this man who is having fwb with this woman who's so in love with him & i'm so confused what to do, clearly this dudes a player.	1

m 31 dating f 27. three weeks ago she asked me to be her bf, two weeks ago she tells me she loves me, this week she dumps me. backstory on the 27 f that i was dating. two years ago she was in a physically abusive relationship that almost killed her. fast forward to this october when we met. i met her and sparks flew immediately. we ended up hooking up this first night we ever met. at this time she was in the process of moving to the town that i lived in but wasn't in town full time yet. so from about the beginning of october, she would come into town for about four days to move stuff into her new place and to see me of course. things went well between us mostly except for a few red flags(she would pull away and become very distant for a few days before always coming back and saying she wanted to do this it was just her fears from her last relationship getting in the way. fast forward to mid-december she moves in, and we start hanging out all the time. sex is great, we are all over each other all the time, always doing things together, sleeping over with each other three nights a week, etc. etc. january comes, and we spend a great new years together. the following weeks seem only to get better. one day about two weeks ago she stopped me and ask if i'm serious about being part of her life...i say yes...she asked me to be her boyfriend...which enthusiastically say yes! the next week she tells all of her friends that's she has a bf and her parents. she even post a picture of us on her instagram. the next weekend marks are four months, and after a lovely date she pulls me aside and tells me she thinks she loves me. i tell her that i love her and we spend a great night together. i'm as happy as i can be. the next morning she wakes up saying that she had a dream that i cheated on her(her physically abusive ex also cheated on her all the time). she seemed very bothered by it...she tells me that night she needs her own space and would like to sleep alone. i have no problem with it. i don't hear from her much sunday or monday except for a call before bed telling me she loves me. i don't think much of it, but something in my gut was bothering me about it. i also told her she was welcome to sneak over if she wanted(just being flirty) and her response to that was almost like annoyance. "like i told you wanted to stay at my place why don't you get that," i tell her that i was joking and trying to be flirty..i apologize. the pivotal night i think was the past tuesday she called and invited me over at around 10:30...i can tell she's drunk and i'm dead sober. i go over, and she's playing drinking games with her roommate (i'll call her ryan), ryan's guy she's hooking up with and his friend. i'm tired and annoyed plus i'm not feeling well. my girlfriend is showing a lot of attention to this other guy(including at one point telling him she had hair product to help his hair, going and getting in and rubbing in his hair right in front of me. i gave her a look of being annoyed/jealous which she noticed right away. she tried to come to start talking to me, but at this time i was also feeling very sick(turns out i had food poisoning) i get very ill later on that night, and she helps but mostly seems annoyed by doing so. after everyone leaves, i'm in her bed sick as a dog, and i can hear her and her friend ryan whispering in the living room. after about an hour she comes in but is very distant. i stay the next night with her, and we have a talk about us, and she asks if i'm possessive or the jealous type and i say no(which i have never been towards her or anyone) i admit that she made me a little jealous that night plus i was already feeling sick. i said it was stupid and i wasn't worried about it and didn't want to fight. she agreed and said sorry once again her fears got into her head that night, and that's why she was acting so weird. the next night she's distance again. i don't see her, and she doesn't even call me/or text me good night...which is uncommon. i go to bed. i wake up with a paragraph text on friday morning saying, basically she's going out of town this weekend to see her parents, and she needs space and doesn't want me to call or try and talk to her at all. i freak out admittedly...i try and call her but no answer. i text her saying space is fine, but i would like to talk to her before she leaves to try and figure out whatever problem this is. she doesn't respond until late that night. she asks me to bring a pregnancy test over(she was late on her period) i come over with the test(she is drunk), and we take it together...not pregnant btw. then she comes out of her room with all my stuff packed up and gives it to me. she says she can't be my girlfriend anymore. that's she loves me and is in love with me, but can't give me 100 percent of what i need. that she's going to keep pulling away. also, a bunch of stuff about how she needs to focus on herself and her friends. i'm upset and asking questions like why did you tell me you love me, why did you ask me to be your bf, etc. etc...she seems angry and annoyed and keeps saying why don't you get it. she goes out of town this weekend, and we have mutual friends who show me her insta story of her out partying with a bunch of people...they blocked me from seeing her stories . i'm so confused at this point. i go out saturday night with friends and get very drunk and regrettably call her late leaving a message saying i miss her, and i'm so confused, i just want to talk, etc., etc., she also posted a picture of her and her friends out that night that i liked while i was drunk that same night. i wake up sunday, and i'm blocked. on everything...i'm blocked on instagram , i tried to call her after seeing that, and i'm blocked on her phone as well. to make this short, i'm so confused. i need advice. i need someone to help me make sense of this. i love her and care about her deeply, and i don't get what i've done wrong. i know i should have given her space, but i'm just so mindfucked by being so vulnerable with her and telling each other we love each other and then going immediately to this. completely cut off. we have never had a fight or a argument. i'm truly devastated and confused. what did i do wrong? please help! tl;dr: basically had a great relationship going with a amazing girl. girl does have a past horribly abusive relationship, i was her first relationship following that one. girl ask me to be her bf, tells all her friends and family, girls tells me she loves me, girl dumps me the week following.	10

net neutrality being reversed, could it be for the best? if the cancelation of net neutrality takes effect and they really do expect us to pay more for content then maybe this whole thing will be for the better. imagine a world where you had to see people in person to interact with them. or a place where you had to learn the old fashioned way or self teach. the innovations that could come from it. hell. maybe even create a new internet that can't be regulated by a vote? a world with less people hiding behind a keyboard persona, the realness it could bring. maybe just maybe, we would have nothing better to do but to focus on the people we elect to represent us to ensure this type of stuff never happens again. society is too preoccupied with whatevers being forced into their eyes /ears from the media and internet to even begin to realize this bill passed last year when trump was voted in. it was just a matter of time. now with all that said theres still court process' this has to go thru and it wont be til sometime in march before you should see this effecting you or your bill.

ruining my husband's final project. my husband is a furniture design major in college and has spent a great deal of time making a beautiful tea cabinet for one of his projects. he was having me help him take it to the car so he could bring it to final critique and my foot hit the edge of the stairs wrong and i fell down the stairs. now his cabinet is ruined and i have a sprained wrist and some gnarly bruises *and i'm pretty sure i'm the worst wife ever* edit: he was more concerned about me than the cabinet, i still feel terrible about it though.	5

trying to locate a tv show episode that i vaguely remember is killing me! i thought that it was an early "black mirror" but it's not. can you help? a couple of years ago, when i was new to netflix (2015ish?), i saw a few episodes of a creepy show that seemed to focus on technology being abused. sounds like "black mirror," right? i know. but it wasn't. and now it's driving me crazy trying to remember what show it was and locate it to watch again. one episode (or segment) had to do with a girl being chased around a city at night, and she encounters a guy who offers to help her, but then it's revealed that she's with a few other guys and they're psychos, and i think that they kill the good guy. i know that's vague. my next memory may better help you to help me figure out what show this was. a guy is driving around at night, listening to his gps as it guides him to his programmed destination. but eventually he ends up outside the city in some sort of abandoned industrial area. he starts to curse at his gps, and the voice on the gps curses back at him. he ends up getting stabbed to death by what we are supposed to surmise was the person behind the hacking of his gps to deliberately lead him out to this ambush. if you know what friggin' show i saw this on, please tell me. thanks! by the way, this is my first-ever activity on reddit -- 01/04/2019.	8
