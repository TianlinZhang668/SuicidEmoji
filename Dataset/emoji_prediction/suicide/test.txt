been suicidal for 1 month now, cant talk to anyonehardest 6-8 months in my life, been drinking seriously for 2 months now, was on 5-htp for 1 month until a 800mg overdose and i puked. nothing works out wellz everything collapses around me and no friend of mine can help me, and i dont want to put such a weight on my parents' shoulders. been thinking about death and how life would be afterwise for some time, and im losing performance at my job, gym, writing, even dating. i became completely introverted, whereas im super extroverted and i need to be around ppl to be fulfiled. i just dont want anyone around me. i texted the person who got me to this stage (amongst other things), read but no response, its like absolutely no care. i wrote an official last wish, in which i name the things relevant to name to whom id pass them. for the past few weeks i found that literally nothing brings happiness anymore, from hitting the gym, or the boxing bag, through playing video games to even jerkin it off. a salary raise didnt bring any either. nothing. i just cant. also im facing minor insomnia so sometimes i cant even fall asleep to find peace at the end of a day. with 5-htp i failed so i'll def. make sure it works next time, i just havent done it. for the survivors, why did you not end it after? i cant see any other way out... i appreciate any form of help!	😊
suicidal ideationi very very frequently think about killing myself and how i would do it. also think so much about how much relief that would bring me and how much grief it would bring other people. however i absolutely would never kill myself because i have 2 beautiful children that i love to death. if in some kind of freak accident or whatever they both died i would immediately follow them out of this world. my thing is i desperately would like to express my suicidal ideation with a therapist or psychiatrist. but i'm absolutely terrified if i did my kids would be taken away from me. they are not in any harms way and well taken care of, probably spoiled to death in most people's eyes lol. but how do i address my mental health without risking my children being taken away from me?	😔
made one post here three years ago. literally nothing has improved i made one post here almost 3 years ago now when i was 20. i literally took a bus across the country thinking i was going to jump off the golden gate bridge. igot too frightened and found some hope in me that things might get better, but my sadness has exponentially grown since then. i feel like i have carried the weight of sadness and disappointment and bad luck enough for 10 lifetimes and i'm only 23. i thought about writing my whole story here because it could be cathartic, but i just honestly want someone to reply. i don't want to feel so scared and alone. i feel like i have missed the bst years of my life without even being able to live them. one of my problems was i was put on a high dose of anti-anxiety medication when i was 5 until 20, and i literally feel like i was involuntarily put into a coma for that entire time. i feel like i had no youth, no teen fun, no friends, and the most painful, just wasn't myself my whole life. i had so many things going for me despite this, but health problems due to the long term effect of this medication on me gave me chronic physical pain for 4 years (18-22). i was bedridden and living alone during this time and had no human contact. i had so many dreams for my life, and i feel it's too late now. but the most painful part is the feeling of being 23 and feeling like...what? how am i 23 when i never had a youth or adolescence? there's a lot of other things too. i've seen so much cruelty and sadness in my life. i just want to see the good but it never comes. i just want someone to understand and be kind. i just want my youth and life back.	😔
i don't know what else to do i don't even know what i'm doing here. i just dont have anyone else in my life i can talk to. my parents have always brushed off and minimized mental illness, saying i was exaggerating. we've never gotten along, and i couldn't stand living with them. they would just scream at me and scream at me, and if i tried to go lock myself in the room, they'd beat on the door and scream through it. if i tried to walk away to a friends house they would threaten the police. anyone i've ever opened up to has disappeared. i hardly talk to my best friend anymore because hes so fucked up in the head too. i've wanted to not exist since i was eight years old. i'd come home from school and have multiple hour breakdowns because i've never felt like i fit in anywhere. i've always had people to talk to, but i've hardly ever had someone i consider a real friend. every time i got close to anyone, my family would move states and i had to start over. nobody has ever been in my life more than a handful of years. i've always been a strong kid, i really have. but i've been living in this hell for almost a decade. but these past few years everything has gone south. my parents forced me to get an expensive car when i was 16, paying for it all myself. over $550 a month, they didn't do shit to help me. i wanted to buy a car outright with the couple grand i had saved up, but they had other plans. instead i used $2000 as a down payment because i wasn't allowed to purchase anything without a warranty. so now i was 20,500 in debt in high school. i had started smoking cannabis to help clear my head. oh man, you have no idea how much of a relief it is to not have thoughts of suicide invading my thoughts every waking moment of my life. but with school and being 16, i legally couldn't work enough to pay for the car and other expenses. so i turned to selling cannabis. i made enough to get food and pay for my car now, maybe go to the movies every now and again. but that's not me. i used to be a good kid, i never thought i'd turn to selling drugs. i cant help but resent my parents for what they turned me into. when i was 18 i moved out, into a my best friends trailer with his father and girlfriend. if i stayed with my parents i wouldnt be writing this now, i would have done it already. so now i had to pay for that bullshit car, and pay rent, and pay for food, and pay for my animals, and pay for everything else i needed. i couldn't sell my car because i was hit twice, once by a texter, another by a drunk driver. it was worth 6 grand less than i owed on the loan. when i was finally able to get rid of it, i got an old piece of shit suv for free, no a/c, windows dont work all the time, holes in the seats, rust all over, locks dont work, etc. i pay 3x as much in gas. i dont want to go to jail, so now that i am an adult i chose to stop pushing weight and just work legally. so i was working 80+ hours a week. i couldn't do it, i was so close to ending it working so much. so i kicked it back to 60 hours, and one of my jobs doubled my workload and asked me to clean biohazard without proper equipment. i quit, i'm not getting diseases from cleaning up shit without protection for minimum wage. so now i work 2 days a week at another job, and do craiglist work when i can find it. what little money i had saved up is gone. i refuse to turn to selling drugs again. and in this small town, i've applied at every business within 20 miles. i've gotten interviews, but that's it. i have no useful skills to get a real job other than retail. i have no way to go to college. i have no way to get an apprenticeship because they're all so far away, i'd hit empty before i got to work on the first day. i have nothing anymore. i used to have good days. i used to be able to talk to people without it draining me. food used to taste good. i used to be able to sleep soundly at night. i tried going in to get medication, but i'm so scared to take it. i'm so close to killing myself and i dont want the medication to put me over the edge. i cant afford the gas to get to a reputable psychiatrist, nor can i afford the copayment. i'm in debt with no way to pay it back. i cant even afford food for my animals this week i've never seen a future for myself past 30, but recently i dont even see next week. i'm sorry. if you read this far, you've done more for me than anyone else in my life has. i'm so sorry for this jumbled mess, i pulled into a parking lot and i've been crying this whole time. i left so much out but i just cant think straight. i'm sorry.	😭
life is a never ending shitty loopsociety is a fucking mess when i first got depressed and tried to kill myself at nine. i am now 13 and go to a therapist but it doesn't fucking help. when i finally opened up to my parents they just said it would be mean to them to kill myself. like my life is less important than their fucking happiness. i feel like there is no point to life and where i live school is fucking mandatory. all these people who barely know me thinks getting good grades is more important then my mental health and that i don't deserve to take my life or be sad because i have such a fucking good life. like that worked. i was googling least painful way to die when i stumbled across this and tbh this made me feel way better then anything else have. my biggest fear is my life going in a loop like it does right now. i am so sick of life. thanks for listening to my ted talks	🙃
unrequited love suicidei have loved her for ten years. she loves me but isn't in love with me . i'm so hurt and in pain yet she is out on dates and fucking other guys. i have been told to accept it or leave. would killing myself cause her to feel as much pain as i am experiencing? i'm tired of the pain and hurt. she doesn't care. i'm just her friend. she looks right through me. i wanna die...	🙄
in advance sorry for my bad english. i just wanna share my story. it all started 2 years ago, where i ducks up my relationship with the girl i was sure i was gonna end up marrying, she was the girl i had been looking for! after we broke up, i started being inside a lot, like 24 hours every single day of the week. ( i used to play soccer 4 times a week, but quit that too) stopped attending school, cause why would i bother to show up. i got kicked out of school, and started to be a lot on the computer, started gaming, and that's basically all i do now, i've gained a lot of weight, until i started to starve myself, and in 3 months, i've lost 34,8kg. and i now weigh 58kg as a 17 year old guy. i've tried to kill myself multiple times, and failed every time. but this time it's totally different, i actually wanna die, for real. i hate being here, i feel like a burden to everyone, and especially my family, which i moved away from, cause i felt i put them in a bad light. my arms are covered an scars from cuts and self harm, and i hate being with other people. just had to share this somewhere, thanks.	💔
how i fucked my life up... now i want 2 die i am completely fucked. i had to leave uni due 2 my depression and anxiety. one major reason why i actually did is that my parents said it was fine and that i didn't need 2 worry about money issues (my family are poor) i asked them countless amount of times is it okay and they said yes. (they also pretty much made my mental state worse at uni by constantly calling saying when the year is up i can't stay with them and that they were moving) i moved back went to see a doctor got prescription for depression and anxiety. organised therapy (on a waiting list). i can hardly go outside without having a panic attack at this point. but now my parents said that i need 2 leave by next month because they can't afford 2 keep me while i deal with my mental health. i'm a burden on everyone which i got myself 2 blame. i am such a weak minded person that i'm scared 2 commit suicide but also rather be dead at this point because my life has been a constant struggle with abuse. i thought i could maybe do better going 2 uni but i fucked that up getting sucked back in a worse situation. i have been always told that i was a burden, a waste of space and that i was a fuck up even tho i'm the only one in my family 2 get any qualifications nevermind getting into uni. i'll most likely end up homeless as i can't even work as i have little work experience and i try part time jobs just 2 end up having a panic attack early on which got me fired each time. my friends are all at uni doing well 2 which makes me feel worse while i'm at home being a sack of shit who stays indoors all day with no social interaction other than my parents berating me about life. i don't even know what 2 do and it's killing me. my friends constantly remark about me being a mess. i get worse every day this goes on. i'm trying to get better but other factors just make this worse which is killing me. i'm a total fuck up. sorry for this long as piece of text with about 2000 mistakes (somes me up) i just needed 2 get it off my chest quickly	😭
fuck life. fuck everything. you don't know what it's like to feel anxiety during every waking moment. there has never been a happy moment i have had that was not accompanied by that sinking, throbbing, fear just below the surface. i tried to go out and run today to get in shape. i ran through the park, hoping that maybe, i would start to feel "normal" here. i smiled and waved at people as i ran. "was this how it worked? am i doing it right?" i said to myself in my head. apparently not, because that creeping fear hit me every. single. time. even if they smiled and waved back, i was screaming inside my head. their voices caused my blood pressure to rise and fall. they had complete control over everything. i got back into my car, and i drove home. i felt desperate to not waste my day off, so i got my book of writing prompts and tried to write something down. nah. i played videogames instead. again. after 4 hours, i felt....bad. really bad. i kinda remembered how fucking awful my life was. and oh yeah, no friends either, so there was that. live with it. deal with it. haha, oh boy. there's really nothing left, guys. there hasn't been anything for a long time now. words are just words, and none of this matters. been nice, i guess. met some good people, watched some good movies. holy shit, wish i could've enjoyed them more. not really an option given how my mind is. i was born like this. guys, i really think that tonight is the night. i'm feeling absolutely dead right now. not in a peaceful way though. in this horrid, headache, furious, mad, thriving throbbing get it the fuck over with already kind of way. yikes	😂
my mind. random post. some days are good, some are a challenge. my mind never stops. i have a 9 year old and a husband. some days i wonder, why do i keep going. i try and do my best. i take care of the normal house duties. my kid's dad isn't in the picture. i get angry at him out of nowhere just cause of the expectations i have it him. i get angry and shut down just cause i think way to much. i feel like i'm not happy. i am a happy person, but i just catch myself. i do struggle with depression/anxiety, would it's nothing new. i think of the, call into the void, from time to time. just how easy it is to give up. i just feel hopeless sometimes. i know this is a rant/ me just vomiting this out. i just need to get it out. i talk to my husband and sometimes it's tough too, just to get my feelings out. i just want to be hugged and told it's going to be okay. i don't have really any friends, just a few, and i just don't even want to vent to them like i have this huge issue / problem. i feel like i'm being selfish	😔
i got dumped a day before my birthday i got dumped by the love of my life on the 21st telling me she found someone new who could actually make her happy... a day before my birthday and she waited untill i had already rented the car and got the hotel in vegas so we could celebrate my birthday to tell me this so i went to vegas alone found a website where you can pay people to come cuddle you and dropped close to 400 cuddling an ex stripper shit faced out of my mind after taking like 10 xanax bars and the stripper took me to a hookah lounge and a strip club where we both were both taking shots and she got me on stage and a dance from some ghetto strippers and then took me to another bar and then we went back to my hotel and she cuddled me for free at the point untill i fell asleep and she got up and left it was so crazy and wild and nothing i would normally do i felt so awkward the next morning when i saw the videos on my phone i called the stripper to come cuddle for another hour for 100 bucks so i could apologize incase i did something i couldent remember but she said i was the perfect gentleman and yet now i'm back home and i still want to kill myself even more then ever now i just cant get the idea of jumping in front of a train out of my head i'd need my xanax to do that tho and i took my month supply of 30 bars in the 2 days i was in vegas in some halfassed attempt that i might just stop breathing in my sleep since i was drinking more then a bottle a day with them i just feel so hopeless and lost now my ex keeps telling me she's here for me if i need to talk but one of the reasons she left me was because i'm so depressed and suicidal so i dont want to make her sad or worry her by telling her how close i am to just being gone but at the same time she's the only person i could talk too... idk what i'm going to do i'll probably give it a couple more months but if this psychiatrist cant figure out what's wrong with me i'm checking out so far i've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and she thinks i have adhd and high function autism but she haven't officially diagnosed me with those and she says i have a personality disorder but it's to soon to tell which one i'm just so fucked in the head and the drugs arnt working my works just getting worse and worse everything's falling apart by the day i dont think there's anything anyone can do for me at this point i'm just big of a mess for anyone to handle	😞
my life...i'm 20 years old and i've been low for a long time! it's about the member down there! i've measured my penis bone pressed and got it to 9cm flaccid and 13,5 erected! i feel like that is to small! i think of it every day! doing exercises like never before, searching how to make it bigger, but it doesn't follow! my biggest dream in life was to get a wife and kids! but i think that's no point dreaming... no girl wants that small of a penis it is really small and i feel its hard to find smaller on the internet. everyone is bigger! and since nothing works to make it bigger and you have no one to talk to about it (i don't have a dad) maybe it's time for me... time to end this miserable life... just wish i was normal.. wish things were different... why did i have to get this shit life? people that are complete shit gets everything.. can't even get a normal dick.. i'm not here for attention i've been her for a long time but nothing is changing i though maybe the exercise would help.... guess this is my goodbye	👋
what i'm not telling peoplei made an attempt a year ago when i was dumped. my family thinks i'm getting better but the truth is the only reason i haven't tried again is because they'd blame my ex, and i still love her and would never want her to be blamed for that or feel guilty. she has enough on her plate she doesn't need me fucking up her life but i wish i could die so badly, i wish with all my heart.	😞
might yeetlow key want to die rn	✌️
i turned into a crazy ex and feel so pathetici was losing my mind after i quit smoking. like i'm not the type of personality who likes to live with an increased risk of cancer. fuck... life isn't a joke. if your body gives out it's over. you have to eat extremely healthy, constantly work-out, make sure your body is in top shape. what did i do? fucking smoke all day!! everyday i would constantly smoke cigarettes and spliffs and my diet was just whatever. like no idea, just dicking around with hamburgers and other garbage. barely any fruits and vegetables. just destroying my body. now when i'm older i feel so fucked up about it. i constantly go to the gym, eat healthy, sleep well, quit smoking and trying to save my life. i'm 28, quit almost one year ago smoking like 5 spliffs (tobacco + weed in a joint) per day and cigarettes too. i think i'll get cancer because of smoking someday. ahhhh :( now i'm just a normal healthy person who tries to keep his body as healthy as possible. but it's fucking scary because i didn't do this for like 8 or 9 years at all. it's such a fucking huge contrast... it feels like such a different person who did that. so naturally: i lose my mind. i talk with everyone about this. everyone encourages me to keep going. i go with my friend to the gym everyday. i eat so much healthy food! like i'm just manically trying to get better. gain weight and become so much healthier. i also want to talk with my ex for some reason. i'm not thinking this through and let her know how hopeless i feel. she was so helpful in the past and i'm like i need to talk with her. but i'm so dumb because i get completely carried away when she finally replies. i finally have her attention and want her to listen what i'm going through. she blocks me though and something goes haywire in my brain and i keep making new accounts (it takes like 3 seconds on instagram). i keep talking about my problems and she keeps saying something i want to reply to and then blocks me. i walk right into a trap. oversharing my problems with her and then she feels overwhelmed and insults me so heavily. like fuck... so heartbreaking what she said. makes me even feel worse. i really don't understand why i did this. being so fucking annoying with making new accounts. she engaged a bit so everytime she blocks me and i want to reply to what she says. i didn't even think about what i was doing was strange. ugh wtf why did i do this after that i keep begging her for months to talk because it's like... just give me some validation :( you can't insult me so badly that my whole spirit is broken and then not talk to me ever again. so then i get stuck in this compulsive rut of sending her messages on instagram dm and then think: nah, this doesn't work and delete them again. then write them again because living with those insults repeating in my head hurts too much too. i wrote so much shit and then deleted it again. i just kept thinking of things to say why it's fucked up why she treats me like this. broke up for her. she didn't even let me explain how i was living incredibly healthy now and that i'm trying so hard to save my life. if she'd just call and let me make amends i'd feel so much better. but after months of trying and embarrassing myself i gave up. she doesn't want to talk at all and now i've spammed her so much in vain that i'm even more fucked up because i turned into a stalker. like crazy ex to the max. my emotions are calmed down a bit after like 6 months, but i feel so utterly embarrassed for my pathetic behavior. like if your ex clearly indicates she's not the right person to talk about this then why did i keep going? it's so strange that i did that. i also kept trying to explain it after she wrote her insanely cruel last message, but it's just such weird behavior of me. then i harassed her for months to talk it out because her insults ruined me so much that i walked around as a zombie. feel so destroyed by this situation. like i'm such an idiot to end up in this position. i wish she had saved me with a 'i will never reply again' and i would have gotten the message. i guess i kept making new accounts because i wanted her to understand me? like humans like to be understood by people they care about so i wanted to tell her about my extreme existential crisis i'm going through and she just keeps dismissing me and even saying she doesn't fucking care if i die and so much harmful other stuff in the end. that made my problems even worse. i felt even smaller and felt like i don't deserve to live. i felt completely broken by her insults and often slept for way too long to escape having to face another day with her words hating on me constantly repeating in my head. fuck. so hard to make a comeback after acting like this. what's wrong with me??? why am i such a strange idiot?? :( fuck, fuck, fuck :(	😓
you deserve to live your life idk who needs to see this right now, but it gets better. i know how that sounds, and that you've heard that a million times before, but you are just as entitled to a full and happy life as anyone else. especially the younger people on here, i just turned 19 and i've struggled with stuff my whole life,, the worst it's ever been was back around december and into january. but life doesn't even begin until after high school. wether you know it or not, people will care that you're gone and it will destroy a lot of people so if anything stay strong for them. then soon enough you'll be free to find out who you truly are because it gets better. if you're caught in a nihilist existential crisis and realize that nothing really means anything, then look at it like this: if nothing actually means anything, then in turn the only thing that matters is your life. make the most of it, happiness is harder than it sounds but you got this because you're stronger than that. love y'all if u need anything lmk	❤️
still not sure if i should die just a little sample i didn't start out with too much, i wish i could just be like the other people, with perfect mental health, i hate living with my condition, i don't even know myself anymore so i choose to drink my problems away whilst hiding my drinking from family and friends, i hate living my life, why couldn't i be born into a different life, a stable household and functioning family. everyone i talk to says it gets better, this is not what's happening. for the past 2 years i've tried everything i could to get ahead only to be held back by social anxiety, shitty parental support and i guess plain old bad luck. i was served a shit hand, it really won't matter if i'm gone, if anyone stopped to check in on me maybe i'd feel like i'm worth something, well, i hope you start to talk about me to all of your friends for attention, start to pretend like you care, you're all just as selfish as me. i don't care for the daily grind anymore, getting nowhere in life, doing nothing with my limited time on this earth. i wish i had a good job and a car, then i could believe that i was making a difference and not being a fucking leech to the system, i could drive places and get out of this fucking house every now and again i hate my grandparents for being such lazy, self destructive, hypocritical selfish pieces of shit, especially when my grandmother takes her frustration and problems caused by a lifetime of knowingly making bad decisions and not giving a fuck about the future out on me, and blames me and other people for everything wrong in her life instead of taking responsibility for her actions, fuck you, you lazy angry bitch of a cow i don't really have much to leave to anyone because i'm such a poor cunt, i guess i'll just have to leave you with the burden of my suicide. i hope i was a good son, brother, mate, partner, grandson, student. no one could have done anything to stop me feeling this way, i'm too scared to say anything out of fear for being judged as weak or crazy. i'll catch you later, have a great one i'm not sure who i'm going to leave this to, or when i'm going to do it but i hope my method is effective enough to make sure i'm dead before someone finds me and the ambos come	👍
they reported me as a missing person!i thought you had to be missing for an x amount of time haven't even been gone for 24 hours and people already up my ass. i left the note saying what needed to be said but still geez. anyway talked to one of their peoples and she told me she's taken me off the list since i look like i'm stable and not in any type of danger or hurt. now got the family bombarding me with calls and messages but honestly don't want to talk to anyone right now i'm just laying in bed in the hotel room. haven't slept so going to try that after i finish writing this. lots of mixed emotions going through my head right now. it's like i'm sure i want to go through with it but at the same time i'm not. it's so annoying plus can't rent the car yet anyway since i completely forgot they only take credit card if you're out of state. so had to pay my card off last night now waiting for it to post so i can use it. so not really feeling like going out into the city so just going to lay here in bed. fuck it not much different than what i was doing back home. might go out for food though but good thing is i can last a while without food or liquid. but yeah that's my update on my little adventure of wanting to die. stay tuned folks for more updates!!	😂
why! i wonder why no one likes me or wants to be my friend i actually give up nothing good going for me	😞
what does it mean to be worthless? there's a quote in this book called " notes to myself" written by hugh prather, i'll paraphrase it but it's along the lines of, "i am holding this cat in my arms so it can sleep, what more is there." as in, what more *in this moment* is there? i've always loved that. it's my favorite book, i think it always will be. i'm here today because i am clinging to the need to not hurt anyone. i am told i shouldn't work...but i want to. i met and fell in love with my best friend at work. fast forward three years, he's still technically "married" and we're living with his dad. i believe this is my fault. my so told me he didn't think i should work. severe ptsd, major depression, bpd, panic disorder, i hallucinate, and i'm agoraphobic. we cannot afford to live on our own. he says he wants to be with me but spends all night after work on video games, and every weekend it's the same. i love him so much but i feel like a burden and his dad basically told me i was. today. i. do. not. want. to. live. not like this. i have been all over r/suicidebereavement to read how badly my actions could hurt people. in this haze, it matters less. i know you know what i mean. i am in therapy. i take the medications as prescribed. i'm 32f. i laugh a lot, i like to make other people laugh. i also happen to wish i'd never been born. i have a job interview on friday. wish me luck. maybe advice on anything? what keeps you going day to day? thanks for reading	❤️
having nobody to talk to is making me go crazy i feel like when i have someone i can talk to about my fucked up head everything is a lot easier to bare... but right now i have nobody and i'm struggling so bad	😔
iam from iraq and i wont to end my life	😭
i dunno anymore life is a roller coaster of great and not so good times, i don't care about much, lost my license last tuesday for the 4th time, have drug supply charges due to be given in november (mdma and marijuana) , i can't trust myself to make good decisions but i always choose not to talk to anyone, everyone thinks i'm happy and going along, i've always been suicidal since dad walked out of home which i don't remember as well as mum reminds me i was about 8 years old telling her i wanted to die, (dad kept saying he was gonna come home when he never was) i learned after that my mum frets and worries, i have never told my mother anything wrong with the law which i have done, my father knows who i ended up deciding to live with when i was 19 to get me out of the mess "that has just begun" had i continued life there it would most likely be worse, i have an issue with not understanding what i'm doing is wrong, i think every day life would be so much easier if i was not here, we are all going to die one day so the pain anyone feels will be forgotten, i'm not looking at jail time but i should be there 10 times over, no self control and even i am beginning to worry myself, maybe my case isn't serious when i write it out but the last year i have speculated every day and have never said a word to anyone, hiding the feelings from others is easy enough, i've always worked full time and have a bright future i turned 22 a month ago, we are all gonna die one day right?	😭
my last thoughts.. i wanted to come on here and tell my story, of when it was the beginning of the end. when i was a baby, i was rapped by a family member. i don't really remember what and how it happened but i was told later on in life, when i was about 4/5 i was rapped by different family member. and this time i did remember but wasn't sure if it was a dream or something that actually occurred, which just about 2 years ago was confirmed it was real. when i was in 4th grade i was sexually assaulted by a different person, and then my dad was murdered. which took me into a great depression because he was all i had, after his death in 2010, i was rapped again by yet another person from 6th grade up until 8th grade. and if that didn't seem like enough my freshman year it happened for the last time.. so i been rapped and sexually assaulted my entire life , from different people. and i know it's sounds very dumb to say but it felt kinda normal.. like if this happened to everybody, until i was asked about it at school because a counselor noticed some red flags, i told them who it was at the moment and that person is currently in jail. and because he was a family member, my mom hated me for it. she treated me like shit and proceed to make me feel like it was all my fault and that i was in the wrong. i started looking for alternatives to escape my reality and started doing drugs , and running away.. typical teenage things. but i ended up pregnant. at 15. my mom kicked me out and the father of my child took me in.. he cheated on me my whole pregnancy, but i had no where to go. so i forgave him, and he has cheated on me the whole 5 years we have been together if i'm being honest, but i stayed. i didn't finish school, it's quite difficult to find a job and i stay home and watch the kid, clean and cook ect. a couple of months back we talked it out and he said it would be his last time cheating and i believed him.. on friday, i had a mental breakdown, i cried and cried and cried for hours about how much i hate my life and how bad i wanted to end it , because i have no family, no friends and i can't stop reliving my past, i'm still heart broken about my dads death and to top it off i'm constantly worried about him cheating on me and he hugged me calmed me down , and did everything he was suppose to do to and reassured me that i have him and that's all that should matter, "our little family" yesterday night, he fell asleep with him phone on, and i felt like i had all the right to look threw it.. and he was indeed still cheating, not with 1, not 2, not even with 3 but 5 females.. and i've haven't stopped crying since.. idk what to do anymore. after he sat there and watched me cry for hourssss he look me straight in my face and lied. and now i'm on the edge, all i was fighting for was "us" and i didn't even have that.. these are my last thoughts. and i can't wait to end the torture that is my life once and for all	💔
i really want a therapist to just sort the things out that i have going on in my mind..but they are so expensive that it's not worth it	😞

i just want to go so badly but i have obligations. i'm supposed to be looking after my sisters (the golden child) pets while she's out of town having a life and friends. as much as i want to say fuck it and just get it over with, i don't want to prove everyone right that i'm a worthless fuck up after all. i hope i get hit by a truck	🙃
it's hard to feel sympathy for people dying , when all you want is death.welcome to my world	😔
help?i'm goimg to be real straight forward with this. i feel isolated in this reality and the thought of existing on this planet really pisses me off from time to time. i'm actually 14 right now but i feel that when i get older i'm like to go mental and plan a massacre and like shoot up some school likely as a suicide attempt. could anyone help me out?	🤔
just got done cutting need help so please help.	🖤
dae feel like they just need a long hug? i live with my parents and they hug me all the time... but it needs to be from a friend, someone who doesnt feel obliged too. i just want someone to hug me and let me cry for a while. but alas, i need non-shitty friends to get that	🙃
plan ruinedwas going to od this weekend but those plans have been thwarted. i wish i could say i was surprised but i'm used to the disappointment at this point. nothing ever goes my way when i need it to. now i'll have to live through all these emotions again and tiredly make it through another week with higher than usual anxiety. i'll probably have a heart attack before i can do the job myself oh well. gives me a little more time to say goodbye. i just hooe i have the strength to pull through another week and don't just lose my shit	😂
no suicidal shit but life just don't bang like it used to who else can relate?	😞
i need someone to talk to right now im okay in the sense that im not gonna kill myself but ive been thinking of it wayyyy to much and i need someone to vent to right now. edit: to anyone reading this rn i've found happiness. thank you for your help	😊
i failed i can't believe it. i thought it was my way out. it was supposed to be. i was slipping away, but it broke. the fucking closet shelf came right off and i bet everyone in the whole house heard it was pretty loud. i can't face being institutionalised, i'm not sure what to do. i feel like i'm gonna run because if they see what i've done they'll call the police on me. please someone help me. i can't face my parents, they were mad enough about me cutting but a suicide attempt will send them over the top. i just don't have the energy or willpower to do it again but i don't want to face being locked up somewhere.	😭
i wanna kill my selfi'm 21 and don't know what to do.i'm really frustrated with my life.its been 3 years and i still can't get over my ex gf.i don't feel like moving.when i've gained 55 pounds ever since and i don't feel like doing anything.i just wanna kill myself and get it over with	😔
i just wanna not wake up sometimes so i can stop disappointing my family\- have major problems in school \- never had a gf \- barely have good friends \- got no social life whatsoever \- no support from family either \- been having suicidal thoughts last few years some support wouldn't hurt	❤️
my psychiatrist said no :'(i just saw my psychiatrist today. he said no to ect. i burst out in a fit of crying and any ray of hope i had was flung out the window. he said that ect is highly controversial and he doesn't want to risk it. meanwhile, i am so depressed from my total insomnia, dysphagia/trouble swallowing and whole body parathesia. but doctors can't find nothing physically wrong w/ me. they've done mri and eeg. i had a chemical reaction to cbd oil and flonase nasal spray combination that can't be proven. i think of suicide daily. i just want to f*****g die if i can't get better. if i can't get better there is no point in living. he said i can get a second opinion. i don't know how i'm going to do that and i'm afraid i'm still going to get no.	😭
love to you all this christmasi know this can be a really hard day, and i wanted to send love to you all. as someone who has battled terrible anxiety and depression, i can relate to a lot of your words. i found hope and my wish today is that you can too. you are important, you are worthy, you have special things to offer to the world, your past does not have to define you or your future.	❤️
i wish i could punch myself in the face	😂
cathartic almost? writing the goodbyes and the will for my loved ones really did feel like a weight off of my shoulders. anyone else ever experience this? for anyone wondering i didn't attempt to do it - i held out hope for something. sadly, i knew it was just that: hope. in the end i was right. anyways, just wanted to share have a good day everyone.	❤️
doing it in 2 days, goodbye reddit and thanks for being so kind! thanks for being so supportive! goodbye!	😭
my anxiety is only increasing, im pretty much dead on the insideas the yrs go by, my fear has grown into a huge issue. i am so scared of opinions that they drag me on a leash, dress me up, and tell me what to say. the pain honestly makes me want to throw up, but my belly is feeling perfectly fine. my mind being dragged by the 1000 pound stone called my thoughts. i can't breathe, saliva buulds up, can barely speak up. but nobody knows. having anxiety means that telling ppl will give you more anxiety. i feel i am just one more unhappy day from death. i have felt like this since 2016, and have submerged myself into the deepest, darkest place of pain. no hope, not even sucsess can take away the pain. i will wake up tomorrow, and dread the fire in my classmates eyes. to them however, im prolly a chimd minding my own business. but i am really screaming, with the only pain reliever i use to cope with my binding fear being the "it gets better" quote. which i don't believe anymore. i can't speak about it. my family may either watch me like i am a ticking time bomb or make jokes about it. my friends may not understand. they think i'm funny, but i'm rly just a walking corpse, waiting for my lungs to catch up with my heart. i honestly romanticize suicide. it takes away ppl's pain. people look down on you when they see you, but trust me, they'll love you and miss you when they are burying you. funerals are now what i want to obtain the most atm. poor family, they're religious selves think suicide equals hellfire. but i feel like i'm in hell, and one more day is a step further in the lake of fire. :(	🖤
following up today i haven't left my room in another 24 hours no bathroom no water no food again just drugs and alcohol i've been up with no sleep for awhile now , everything is moving so fast now by the time i stop and take a breath another 8 hours have gone by and i literally peel my soaking wet body off my bed sit up and watch everything dance and wave around me i feel like i can't see anything anymore until look at myself in the mirror and know how the rest of today tonight ia gonna go but i'm so uplifted by these psychotic ideas and fantasies that are going on in my head and i know they are crazy but it's nice right now and just i keep reminding myself the walls and floors aren't really moving and i start to panic and wish i had someone here but i know i'm alone for now and there is no better way you know i would have called you by now and too be honest i wish anyone would have called me last but making sure everyone else is ok and safe is always more important. i'm done or any nuisance this time i wanna be peaceful i'm never stressed or angry like i've been these past few months but i'm just so calm and quiet and i've honestly never felt like this before but i dreamt you were given some money and went to china and a bunch of countries to work and travel makes me happy right now thinking about it i'd rather still feel like im in a fantasy ,i'd rather think i still had a chance with you instead of the reality, when i realize it's been months and your already gone. wrote a will out when i was upset a month ago but i didn't rip it up or anything i know i'll be able to make you smile one more time and you may even be pissed and honestly i'm gonna keep smiling about it because i know someday ur gonna get it. talk tomorow	🖤
i want to kms and end it all :(both my family and my ex have told me to go die and i feel so fucking betrayed. my family has always wanted me to be perfect and if i don't do one thing right, i get abused. my dad has had cancer for 12 years and he's gonna pass away soon and it saddens me a lot because he's the only one that used to defend me. my ex broke up with me 6 months ago because i had/have mental health issues like depression, ptsd, bpd, anxiety. and even tho it hurt, we were cool. until a few days ago he texted me he hates me, he doesn't want anything to do with me and i'm better off dead i can't stand it anymore. i've suffered enough. i'm so tired. i'm under so much pressure and suffering so much pain. i can't do anything right, i feel so useless and like such a failure. i've decided to end my life for good (i have previously attempted suicide a few times but failed). they don't even care that i'm still here, when i could have been dead last month. they take me for granted and it hurts so fucking much. i feel so betrayed and backstabbed. why cry when i was in hospital if they still act like this towards me? i'm going to kill myself soon because i'm exhausted.	💔
i just hit myself in the head for the first time in a month and told myself i would kill myself	😔
goodbye guys just read my posts on r/advice if you wanna know	👋
please kill me i can't wait any longer	😓
sigh.... i confronted (ldr) girlfriend... again. started crying and denying.. she hung up and said she couldn't do this tonight. from a good/decent day/night, communicating, talking, to this. why do i love this damn girl so much? i hate her. *sigh* i'm so heartbroken, depressed, sad. i can't sleep anymore... i don't know what to do.. i feel so trapped. so empty. so dead...	😔
no one cares i don't know anymore i've got to a point where i'm not depressed every night when i get home from what i'm doing if it's work or college but every now and then my brain reminds me no one loves me and i'm just that guy in the background who never gets noticed. i really would like to die right now i feel judgement breathing down my neck everyday.	😕
i don't know why.. i've been suicidal since i can remember. from the age of 12 i've wanted to kill myself, but i've always backed out or the feeling has passed and i've "come to my senses". my life right now isn't perfect by any means but it's a good life, i've for a loving boyfriend and my parents are good to me i just don't know why i still want to kill myself . if i talk to someone about it they'll tall me out of it. i don't want that i just want someone to listen to everything i have to say and not judged or talked out. i have no idea why i still feel suicidal	😩
crappy birthday to me... so my birthday is almost over, it was supposed to help me forget the bullshit ive been going through lately but so far ive been cheated on, i crashed my car and im getting evicted... not to mention that i don't even have any money to go out to the bar and have a fucking drink with because the cheating bitch stole it. i just want a hug	😢
tonight is the night for me. i can't take it anymore.i have a bipolar disorder and i can't live with it anymore. even with therapy and meds it's not helping me at all. i can't take this anymore i just want peace and i'm going to kill myself	😔
can't deal with people being disappointed in mei mean all the time. before i go on i am 99% sure i wont kill myself, but i write this none the less. so i'm almost 19 and i recently quit my job at mcdonalds because i got a grant with the city. when the grant was over i had a few weeks of free time before college started up and was happy to be free for a while. but as soon as college started my mother said that she would only respect me if i got a job. i have been looking for jobs that are not fast food for a month with no luck. i expressed my feeling of working in fast food to her and said i would never grt a job in fast food ever again because 2.5 years of hell was more then enough. a week ago she got me a car with the money that was supposed to be used for my tuition and now i am under more pressure then ever to get a job to pay for school and i cannot find one for the life of me. she also recently found out that i sometimes (quite rarley) do psychedelics (mainly shrooms and rcs that break down into psilocin). she was quite dissapointed in that as she just is fed all of this fucking bullshit from the government that she just follows blindly. she even said to me that weed is fucking addictive. she said that she is against drugs that "change your brain". but when i called her out on what ever the fuck pills she takes she said that it was ok because those are legal. fuck off. i occasionally grt given cigs by friends at school and will smoke them if i feel particularly stressed. i smoked one in my room just a half hour ago and she comes up stairs pissed and takes my keys and won't talk to me. also, not really related: whenever i try to talk to her about anything even slightly impprtant she will completly ignore me. not even a nod of the head. this has happened for years and she just fucking picks fights whenever she can and plays the victim when i raose my voice to try to het her fucking attention. i would have moved out long ago if i could find a fucking job but i fucking cant. i just cant deal with living with this fucking cunt that will kot listen to a aord i say. i feel some of my hatred stems from her being a fucking retarded right wing sheep fuck who doesn't find things out for herself but just listens to the faggots on the news and the bullshit the fucking government feeds her. fuck. this made no sense good night. don't kill yourself if you are thinking about it. just take some money, move to another country and just be a hobo and hop train cars or some shit. i knoa it's what i want to do and probably will in the future. positive vibes.	😩
bedridden with ideation. anyone on runescape 3 to play and talk things through/distract each other? i've been suicidal for a long time, usually ideation. i've finally took the courage to call a crisis hot line, and after 3 calls i've found they are just too scripted to be of help. they're probably suicidal too :( so i've taken back to vid games to distract me. vid games help distract the thoughts, and i just recently got back into runescape 3. i'd love to have someone to play and chat with on there. ( i'm free to play servers) maybe make a few good online friends this way like i did back in the day! i know these are coping mechanisms but i'm trying. and i'm also here to listen to you empathetically, because obviously if you're gonna respond with a username or so you're not in the best place either. looking forward to helping each other through video games and active listening	❤️
answering the dead. okay i guess this is where i'll start. i finally read your letter. and it broke my fucking heart. pretending you were better. and it was tearing you apart. but you fucked me up. i could never put you in this position. you showed me love. and then took it all away with your decision. now i can barley get through this hopeless life im living. quick question did you really love me im just curious. you were always so silent and mysterious. i cant believe you're gone i feel delirious. better yet im actually fucking furious. and at your funeral i wrote a speech but still couldnt say shit. i just fell to my knees and clung to my chest where the pain hit. and in the pews you should see your little brother. he's hurting worst than me cause now he's lost you and his mother. its just a room full of people trying to console each other. this is sick i wish you could see what a mess you left behind. but its too late so did you finnaly get your peace of mind? as for me and love i guess its something that ill never find. and to answer your question after everything you put me through. the answer is no i can never forgive you.	😔
hello everybody, just an updatestill alive	😭
help me	😊
i should be dead by nowbut life some how manages to fuck that up for me too lol. i've been craving some good chinese food before i kill myself today, went to my favorite place and it just happens that of all days, today is the day they're doing a "deep clean" in the kitchen so i couldn't order what i wanted. whatever fuck it, it was just another slap in my already bruised face. i started making my way to the destination where it was going to finally end, i planned the perfect spot for week and what'd you know, roads fucking closed for construction lol... i was trying to be considerate and not leave with a bad image for everyone, but fuck it, firearm it is.	✌️
my dad recently committed suicide on november 20th, the day after my birthday. i'm struggling to make sense of it all. on my birthday he actually went with my wife and i to my wife's 4d ultrasound to find out the gender of our expecting child. he was stoked...it just doesn't make sense	😔
i've decided. my birthday is going to be my last day. alcohol + sleeping pills. i was maybe thinking of ketamine but internet said it wasn't really effective. unless they're hiding stuff from us	🤔
i give upi'm 21 and i've failed. i've destroyed every friendship to come my way, i've disappointed anyone ever holding any type of hope in me, i've failed at everything i've tried and i can't do it anymore. i never envisioned my life ending up like this but i've realized i've always had this delusion thought that maybe one day ill start turning everything around but i've come to see that some people just don't have any redeemable qualities to them.	✌️
if i do ... how do i say sorry to youshe walks through the door placing her keys on the table had a long day so she really wants to lay low but everything she knows is about to go the other way tho calls out the name of the one she wanted to see when she came home she listens out but she gets no reply takes a step forward she wants to know why just out in the the driveway she saw a second car now shes runnin through the house tryna find out where you are in her mind you're still close and you couldn't have gone far. she dashes up the stairs and down to the end of the hall she pulls out her phone and its you she tries to call ring ring ring she can hear your phone ringing she opens up a door and the neighbors heard screaming under a black veil she can hear the choir singing there's your lifeless body laying right there on the floor she never thought she was coming home to a corpse she doesnt even know if she can love you anymore she planned a whole life with you whatchu throw it away for. on the bed all you left was this note but she cant even bring herself to read what you wrote you took everything she ever loved and she forever feels broke afraid to love anyone else or let anyone in scared to see it all come crashing down again a beautiful girl confused about what shes doing all because i was weak and now she's forever ruined. im so sorry i just didnt know what to do the last thing i thought about was would you forgive me if i do? and if you you dont read this then how will i ever say sorry to you ?....	😔
i was dumped and i seriously don't think i can survive this.i was just dumped by my girlfriend the other night, and i don't know what to do. "i can't really say i'm in love with you" is what she said. this just came out of nowhere and i feel like i can't breathe. just a couple of days ago i thought we were still madly in love, now i'm heartbroken and i feel like i'm going to have a nervous breakdown. i just wish i knew what went wrong. i wish she would tell me that i did something wrong, tell me that i fucked up, tell me i had abhorrent personality traits, at least then i could make some sense of it. but she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. she likes me, and cares about me, but she's not in love with me anymore. how am i supposed to react to that? how can you say you love me on sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on friday? she keeps insisting that i didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am i supposed to understand that? i'm just hurt and confused. she stopped by my house the other night to return some things i left in her apartment, my shirt she had (and it still smells like her ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents i gave her for valentines this year. i don't know what i'm gonna do. i spent all night crying, i feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. it's like i'm trapped in a nightmare i can't wake up from. whenever i was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. despite all the bullshit i deal with on a daily basis, i always felt alright, because i knew that no matter what happened i had her beside me, and she made everything alright. i honestly don't know how i'm gonna make it through winter without her. our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and i was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. but when dumping me she was just so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. we were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to react. she said she doesn't see us having a future together; i saw us potentially getting married one day, i definitely saw a future with her. and she used to see one with me, i just don't know what changed. i don't know how to deal with this. without her i just feel dead inside. just last week i was so happy, now i don't know how i'm gonna live without her. she was the best thing that ever happened to me, now i feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. she said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. i don't think i could ever find anyone else as amazing as her. the only one i feel like i can turn to at this moment is my best friend. they try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but i'm a crying mess right now, and i don't feel ready to try to date again; but they are making me go back to online dating and i don't really feel strong enough to object right now. i've never felt this hurt and empty. i don't know how i'm supposed to make it through this.	😢
goodbye...lost everything... great world we live in.. unless your poor.. welp guess i have to go now. it was fun talking to you all, guess we have a hard time taking our own advice. hope i helped the few i gave words of wisdom too.. this has gone on long enough... sux how money controls our lives and so few have any. no kind words or pitty needed, i wont get it anyways. just wanted to say goodbye to someone. "broken, torn and battered, really my life never mattered". much love hope you all find happiness someday. i truly did fight this but some wars u just cant win. goodbye	😢
i don't want to diei love life. waking up refreshed, doing something selfless and nice, being appreciated and feeling good about yourself. i want to live but the pain's too much sometimes. i'm trash and i don't deserve life. one day i could love someone. maybe a girl or another guy. maybe they're people or intelligent robots, idk. i just have so much love to give but i don't know how to give it and who to give it to. i want people to feel good but it's hard for me to show affection. it hurts knowing people love you only because they're blind or feel morally obligated to. i want to earn love. that's all i want :/ everyone who reads through the posts here and tries to help others, i love y'all. i really do, but i don't know how long i'm staying on this earth for. this probably won't be my last post but i just wanted to ramble some nonsense before i cry myself to sleep. i hope you all find happiness. peace	✌️
feeling even more suicidal than yesterday.only thing keeping me from oding on prescription pills right now is remembering how last time i tried i was sick for days. i wish there was a pain-free way to die. i'd take it right now. i'm already dead, i'm just stuck here.	😭
i'm sorry but i think i have to go now thanks reddit for helping me when i had no one. hobey ho let's go.	❤️
i wanna kill my self i'm 21 and don't know what to do.i'm really frustrated with my life.its been 3 years and i still can't get over my ex gf.i don't feel like moving.when i've gained 55 pounds ever since and i don't feel like doing anything.i just wanna kill myself and get it over with	😔
you've made it through another week. that's something to be proud of. things are gonna be alright	❤️
first time i'm truly considering an odi've got some "natural" supplements. if you're smart you could figure out what they are. i'm very tempted to just gulp them all down and deal with the consequences later my life is a mess. i'm a mess. and i don't know what else to do	😕
i hate everything in a few days now and i hate everyone, i'm just tired, i don't want to live, but at the same time i don't want to die, sometimes i want to feel happiness, love, care but i only feel angry and sadness.but somewhere i want to bring my self back, i don't know how i want, but i want me to feel happy again .but i wanna die too.	😔
i recently tried to stab myself in the stomache. to anyone who feels hopeless please read this. too much sadness herei didn't tell anyone or left any notes or hints. i walked into the woods at 3 am with a kitchen knife. i was fully prepared to die. but my buddy called, i felt like an idiot, why did i bring my phone? im just used to carrying it around. but i didn't tell my buddy, i was crying during our conversation. i ended up going home. the next day i told my social worker what happened and they took me to a behavioral health hospital. i came upon some ideas and hindsight! i know we offer think here but hear me out. i believe that there is no god, no one is destined for anything, our lives are completely meaningless when we die we will have no brain to remember what happened and eventually earth too will die. i see the world this way. i know everything will end. until i saw my niece, new born. so innocent, so helpless. i watched the flame from my match burn until it faded. i watched the sun set. i realized that there is beauty in this circle. that my life is limited. i ran to. nj and found a new job. no one knows me so i got to present a new version of myself. ofcourse im still very much depressed. by following what i imagine my best self would do i learned to cope. i still don't have friends though none the less i can't die here. not after everything i've gone through. i wont let my mental illness win. the truth is im so scared. im burning inside. bit i have to try. i want to be a marine someday. im holding on to that dream. it's all i have.	😅
i don't think me being alive is usefuli don't think my existence has really helped anyone i love, all it has done is cause problems. all i have done is cause problems. my entire life, 20 years, i've been nothing but a nuisance. i ruin everyone i love. like literally zero value added . i'm too scared to kill myself but i hope something will. i hope it won't be too painful. i don't actively actively want to die but i'd be okay if i did. less problems eh? not just for me, for everyone who loves me. i am my own worst enemy.	😅
not suicidal but empty. i wish some supportso my boyfriend and i fought yesterday and he got pissed off and called me names and after few hours he blocked me. after like 3 hours he unblocked me then today he told me to stop messaging him even tho when i was blocked i could not message him. idk what's up or if this is some sort of strategy but idk. it's true i mailed him yesterday after he blocked me just telling him blocking like that isn't funny or cool and that was all. he also sits online seemingly expected some answer. wtf is happening. also if it matters the app is what's up so he has no point to stalk me there. (some people said he might do that) . anyway he is more than boyfriend to me we got engaged i just want to tell him i love him and to forget all this shit but oh *please don't tell me it will get better i deserve better i feel worse	😢
had a huge mental breakdown two hours ago because of several things that happened throughout the day.my day started of quite bad. i got called by my best friend (male) at midnight. he sounded totally shitfaced. there were a lot of background noise and a lot of talking. he asked me if i was awake and alone at 00:15. which i said "yes?" to. i had no idea what was going on. then all of a sudden a girl started talking to him and hung up the phone. cue panic attack. like wtf was that all about. i texted him "okay?" about fifteen minutes later. around five i woke up because i felt like i was going to throw up and saw that i had two unread messages from him. in an almost unreadable text he said "huh, have i called you? oof" (translated from another language). i wasn't able to sleep for almost an hour because ya "boi" had another panic attack while in bed. then i woke up at around 14:45 i woke up because i had to pee. dropped my phone on my way to the bathroom and found out that my bank card is gone. (card is supposed to be in the little pocket on the case). went upstairs to tell mom, while having a full on panic attack, only to find my aunt and grandmother in the living room. guess who decided to invite family over for dinner without telling me (and mom). i have been diagnosed with autism, so the change in my plans caused an even bigger panic attack. yay me. three hours later (after dinner), a different "friend" sent me a long video of him lip syncing to "make you mine" by public. i hate getting videos of him. it makes me sick to my stomach. you may think "what's the problem here?". he's in his thirties. i'm still a couple of years away from 20. i've told him so many times i don't want him as a boyfriend. (1 because of age difference. 2 we live in different countries. 3 i'm into girls.) so anyway, after i had to painstakingly watch my way through that video, i sent him a snap saying "i do not enjoy videos from you". he read it wrong and thought i said that i do enjoy getting videos from him. se sent the video in chat and saved it together with a cheesy paragraph basically saying "since you loved the video so much i'll save it here so you can watch it whenever you're feeling down. i love you lots." after i corrected him, he got all sad and said "well shit ". i muted him again at that point. a few hours passed and i thought that was it for the day, but oh boy were i wrong. i watched a r/wholesomememes video by the click. i thought it'd make me happy, but it just made me cry more and more. that's what happens when you bottle up emotions for months. at the end of the video i was just full on ugly crying. i put on my favourite album by xxxtentacion, as you do when you see no end to your suffering. i ended up ugly crying for half an hour while listening to 17 on repeat. after i cleaned up my tears and blew my nose, i just sat at my bed for a while. tried to watch videos, but i just felt dead. no spark in my eyes, no smile, no laughter, no emotion. just dead, but breathing. then i cut myself. once, twice, more and more, the blood started dripping quicker and quicker. i stopped and got some paper towels because, ya know, don't want to leave any blood on the clean bedsheets. so here i am. i failed the "no self harm" goal i made for 2020. just spent an hour typing this. even though probably nobody's going to see it.	💔
tired. fucking tired of living	😔
about to pull a juice world tonight.dueces	✌️
feeling is back againover the last 2 weeks, i've thought about suicide briefly but havent had the urge to try again. now the urge to do it is back again	😭
last year i attempted suicide multiple times because of an ex, but i unsuccessful... and now i'm sort of glad that i was. however, after a year of hooking up with multiple girls and currently being in a new serious relationship i still have the occasional thoughts of suicide	😢
still here.i apologize for posting again, but thank you to everyone. everyone of you are sweethearts, and i thank you for being there for everyone including me. my friend close to me basically saved my life, told me that it was my ex gf's lost and not mine. and i took this to heart. love you all be safe.	❤️
welp, bye welp, in an hour's time i'll finally be wiped off of the face this miserible planet, i've already made up my mind so there's no use talking me out of it but feel free to give it a shot because this account along with all my others are going to be deleted (and chloe if you see this somehow i'm sorry but this is goodbye)	👋
to the helpersadd more love when assisting. let the light guide you on how to help us suicidal people . come outside yourselves and step into a new space , add new things and techniques, and only do what you can . thanks	❤️
should i tell someone i'm suicidal? i'm a second year college student and for the past 3 months i've wanted nothing more than to kill myself. i've been depressed for years but recently i've really gone over the deep end with my mental health and have fantasized a lot about my death. i want to reach out and tell someone i'm suicidal, but my anxiety makes me feel like that'll only make things worse. i talk with my parents every so often, and recently i told my mom i wasn't doing well mentally (although i didn't tell her of my suicidal intentions). she told me that i should try to get help for my depression through therapy, but after weeks of deliberating on going into the hospital to set myself up with a therapist i've realized that my fear of people finding out im suicidal is way larger than my fear that i will one day kill myself. i'm basically avoiding going to the hospital for a psychiatric assessment because i'm scared that if i do ill be committed to a fucking mental hospital because of my suicidal thoughts. i guess i'm just trying to figure out how any of you got over your fear of getting help especially when things are dire. i know i'm scared of getting help but i don't know how to stop the irrationality of such a fear. and i guess finally, should i tell someone i'm suicidal so they'll push me to get help because i know i won't do it myself? or should i keep trying to find a way myself to convince myself to get help on my own? thanks for any advice you may have	❤️
scrambled mind first let me start by introducing myself, i'm 15 years old and go to a boarding school, last year around mid october i stopped smoking synthetic weed for good after 9 months of everyday use. i was suspended because of it from school and the drug has ruined my brain, in the next paragraph i'm going to say what i feel like right now a year later and if you could include in your comments which parts are normal parts of puberty and which parts are not normal, also advice would be helpful . so far i feel less detached from reality but still very detached, it's as if everything is fake, i can't socialise any more unless i analyse the persons body language and i'm still not good because i'm still learning how to socialise from scratch, it's as if i'm a baby. i feel no hope in life because my brain is so fucked, i have the sense that in my mid twenties i'll end up killing myself because i would have made it no where in life, i also have no empathy any more, what used to anger me doesn't, i'm emotionally flat in other words. i have conversations in my head with more than one conscious, also my personality can change based on the situation, basically i negotiate with the consciousness in my head and depending on the situation one can take over. people in my school are also psychopaths and keep using there body language to manipulate my subconscious into thinking bad things so i do what they want without them having to talk... this doesn't help either, i've replaced my sythetic weed hole with exercise, mdma and alcohol. also i can hear things in my head sometimes and be in a very bad mood randomly then in s good mood, i am also eating a lot more healthy to try detox. no one knows about this. this is the first time i've told people since i'm anonymous. if you got through this long paragraph thank you for your time and decent comments will be valued and read,	😊
so so tired i just want it all to end but i can't cos of my family, why can't i just die. there's so many people who deserve to live and yet they die early and me a useless waste keep living. i would swear that this is hell if i believed in that. just soooo tired	😓
suicidei ingested forty crushed taxus baccata seeds, a seed containing an alkaloid that shows no early symptoms before leading to cardiac arrest- consequencing death. i will pass at approximately 3am. i desired to tell my beloved companion who will likely really this at some point in the near future: it is not your fault darling. you know that you had nothing to do with the extinguishing of my life. i love you until my dying breath. i hope the reward for this action will not be too severe, but i realize that is not the case. goodbye my good friends, may your lives be enriched	❤️
i want to overdose but at the same time i don't. i remember a few years ago i regretted doing it straight away and panicked. but i just can't see a way forward.	😞
gonna take a huge overdose tonight, after 17 years on this earth, i'll finally have rest. gonna cut myself first just to make me feel better. good-bye	😁
am i being baited?i'm talking to someone who claims they want to commit suicide but their messages got kind of weird. i'm pretty suspicious at this point but you can never be too safe. well, here we go. sorry that it's a wall of text but i don't really have time to format it. i feel lonely right now...and i might not answer tomorrow... i'm going to attempt again... what are you doing twisted galaxy if you wanted to know what i looked like...but it'll be the last you see of me.. and what i'm doing is hanging myself... <url> that is me twisted galaxy can't open it... okay, what i want to know, is why you are doing this. oh twisted galaxy you can copy image and paste it.. and i'm doing this because... no one cares about me, no one likes me, no one loves me... twisted galaxy no one will realize i'm gone thats why i'm doing this.. what about your family? twisted galaxy i don't have family... i'm adopted.. why are you trying to help me if you need to sleep. because i don't want you to end your life twisted galaxy why because that's really sad twisted galaxy you don't like me. you don't care. what makes you think that? i hardly know you? i care though. just because i don't know you doesn't mean i don't feel empathy for you when you say you want to commit suicide twisted galaxy i've been trying for three years.. i'm on pills... i've been sent to hospitals. is there anyone with you right now? twisted galaxy no. i'm in a cold dark room. why are you alone? also that image says otherwise twisted galaxy what image. that one twisted galaxy thats my hand. it also shows you are in a lit room twisted galaxy so..i turned off the lights. is anyone in your house right now? and if so, why aren't you talking to them? twisted galaxy because they won't help me. have you tried to ask them? twisted galaxy they will bring me across the country. if i talked to them about it again. and it won't help? twisted galaxy nope you need to tell them then so they can find how else to help you twisted galaxy won't help.. no one can help whats happened to me... how do you know that? twisted galaxy i've been sexually assulted. and raped. i'm sorry to hear that but i can't really help you much more because i have no experience with anything like that. i know that it has happened to my mother but she is still alive so it's not impossible to deal with twisted galaxy my mom went through the same... she's alive but suffering anxiety and depression lung cancer and other stuff. i'm suffering my own medical problems. wouldn oops wouldn't your mom be upset if you killed yourself twisted galaxy no. she hasen't seen me in years. you really need to call the suicide hotline twisted galaxy plus her and i suffer anxiety depression lung cancer but i also suffer bipolar, liver dysfunction and kidney disease, that's really the only advice i can give you. the people on the suicide hotline have spent years dealing with situations just like yours. twisted galaxy .... i tried calling different hotlines. none work for me. i can't give you any more advice, i am 13 and i am not good as a suicide hotline. just promise me you won't do it if no one, it upsets me greatly twisted galaxy why.. because i've been through it. i never planned or attempted suicide but i still know how depression feels empathy is part of our genetics twisted galaxy ... -hugs you tightly- i'm not trying to make your situation seem like it's minor because it really isn't. twisted galaxy i wish someone can hold me... -cries into your chest- also i don't believe that it doesn't affect you when someone tells you to kill yourself you said it doesn't but if you really need someone and someone you don't really know can affect your feelings positively it could also go horribly wrong twisted galaxy .... c-can you hold me.... virtually twisted galaxy yeah.. ... twisted galaxy you could've typed -holds you- actually spacing is wonky in this chat (believe me, i tried) twisted galaxy i have a question... yeah? twisted galaxy d-do you l-like like me.... why would you ask that? if i didn't like you i would have gone to bed yet here i am despite the fact that my mom keeps telling me to go to bed twisted galaxy like like though...like more then friends... is what i mean... i'm only 13, that's silly twisted galaxy .... now i'm crying again.... why do you care so much what other people think? twisted galaxy .. i-i'm going to suicide now.... are you manipulating me? twisted galaxy no. i'm really getting that vibe if you're not, then i feel terrible. but only you know the truth so just know this. if you are baiting me, maybe because you want me to be sad, it's not working. i am sad, but it's not making me want to kill myself twisted galaxy why the fuck would i want people to suicide... because i can't know for sure if you're baiting i want to believe you are because this situation is quite sad that's how much i care if you are being serious i'd literally rather you be lying to me twisted galaxy .... can you cuddle me.... vertual i think i've already shown you i care it's way more important than sending you some ascii art if you are not baiting, don't be upset that i believe it's a possibility my mom just said she is coming in and shutting off my computer in a minute. you need to stay safe and get some help. like i said i have empathy but i don't have any experience to help you deal with this. best twisted galaxy i...i like you a lot...	💔
i've decided that today is the day! i'm currently writing letters to the people in my life and those who might find me. i've always wanted something quick so i've decided to drive to the mall and jump off the parking garage, it's like eight floors so it should be efficient lol bye guys!!! good luck with whatever you choose	❤️
trying to get helphow do i ask my doctor for help? i want to try to help myself but i've known my family doctor since i was born, he delivered me, it's almost like telling a family member that i'm suicidal and need help. do i just say like hey i think i have depression or something, i don't have the will to live anymore and what will i tell my parents if i get medication or something? i have to go to my family doctor alone because i know my mom won't believe me and if she does i don't want to see her face when she realizes my situation. if i say i'm on anti-depressants they will know another part of me that i don't share with anyone. i'm scared. they won't understand how hard it is for me to just live, like to wake up, shower, eat, do homework, care about my health. they won't be malicious but i just know they won't understand me	👋
had a gun to my head today, i just barely pulled it away. i've been suffering with depression for years now, mom and dad ignore it when i say i need medication or help, friend ignore it when they talk to me, girlfriends ignore it when i try to tell them how i'm feeling. it's all a big shit show as of lately tonight was the night i was finally gonna pull the trigger but i decided not to and just wait maybe a week or two see if anything goes my way for once. if it doesn't i'll surely pick it up again and follow through with my original plans. currently i have a girlfriend who i've been with for nearing 10 months, we kinda split once and she treats me good and bad and good and bad. she got raped once by the guy she almost ran off with from me but it's whatever. there's this guy named nick who she says is "just a friend" and that i "have nothing to worry about" but what she doesn't understand is that i'm so insecure from what happened with her and i before and i've been cheated on before and she just doesn't fucking get me and she lives an hour and a half away and i can't do shit about anything of this and it fucking sucks. she's the only thing that makes me happy and tonight we had a big ass fight cause i said her friend nick "had bad teeth" she flipped fucking shit cause of it and i feel like she's picking him over me earlier tonight and i just got so fed up with all of the bullshit. if any of you are wondering i'm 17 and i'm in the maryland area if anyone wants to say hi before my final goodbye	🙃
had 2 serious suicide attempts in 2018 hopefully i only have 1 successful attempt this year	😊
i'm 15 and ruined my life my only option is to die and i can't do that so in january 2015 i found out i could force days off school then the day after that faked tearing my thigh muscle and managed to get a month off school, then when that month ended i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which made me have even more time off making it even harder to get back afterwards although for the rest of that year at school (7) i managed to keep an ok attendance and everything was working out then in july 2015 i started to drop off with managing my diabetes which then caused me to lose motivation then in september 2015 i had another month off school, that was the first time i felt suicidal although that didn't last long and everything (except my diabetes which got way way worse) started to improve until after christmas, in january i had another month off school which caused me to officially drop out in february which is when everything started to fall apart, i started pushing away my at the time girlfriend became essentially a hermit let my diabetes get worse and basically did everything in my power to make myself worse 2 months later i lost 3 of my 4 best friends (the one i didn't lose being my ex) then just preceded to feel sorry for myself for the next 3 months when i became friends with someone i used to hate who's now my co best friend (co with my ex) after that nothing changed until january 2017 when i decided to try and get back to school that didn't work out at all and i just got worse afterwards after that nothing changed until june when i started being even more of a wanker to my at the time girlfriend by stopping talking to her and carried on doing that until october when i started talking to her again in december we got back together and i got a job although me and her only lasted throughout december, in january i badly injured my foot which got infected gave me sepsis and nearly killed me (typical of my luck that it didn't ) and i quit my job not long afterwards in march i got back with my ex and i stopped pushing her away but still wasn't anything close to a proper boyfriend but between march and may was the best period of time i've had for years and in may someone kissed her and that was the "final nail in the coffin" between us in that way although we're still best friends but it got to the point where the last thing keeping me going was me and her and now it's gone i've lost all hope because nothings fixable anymore but i'm too fucking pathetic to even kill myself i went out to jump in front of a car which sounds stupid but still and i didn't even have the balls to do it and i don't know what to do because i can't go back and fix things no matter how much i wish i could and i can't and i can't end it but at the same time i can't carry on because i'm basically dead anyway all i do is listen to music and watch movies	🙄
for those who you who are loosing a while ago, i was on this community searching for triggering content. i was taken to the hospital, and when i got through hours and hours of waiting, i was told i wasn't sick enough to be admitted. i wasn't. i've never attempted suicide. i think i was in love with suicide but i'd like to think we've broken up now. and i think the reason i am leaving suicide is because i like people a lot more. i love the way we think, i love our little idiosyncrasies, our messed up emotions and the way we all can think the same thing is right or wrong. i want to see us thrive and fail and fall and sing and crash and loose and find. i want to see it all. for those of you who are loosing, really loosing. you could be loosing because a family member died, or because you have shitty brain chemistry or because you're favourite number two pencil broke. but for those of you who are loosing, it's okay. it really is okay to loose somedays, to fall in love with suicide (or anything the public would consider to be 'bad'). it's okay to decide you need some space, or go on a break . those days that tend to turn the noise up and the common sense down (and vice versa) are okay. one of the reasons i love us fellow human beings is because we all have different stories. and that same characteristic is making this really hard to write. i used to wish i could take everyone's pain and fold it into myself. but i don't want to do that, because your darkness your pain your suffering your loosing is apart of you. so as much as i want to say something that helps every one of your stories, i can't tell you how to deal, or how to make it go away or how to ease it. but i can tell you genuinely that i love the way you think, i love your little idiosyncrasies, your messed up emotions and the way you and me can think the same thing is right or wrong. i want to see you thrive and fail and fall and sing and crash and loose and find. i want to see it all. please let me see it all	❤️
i just don't think i can keep living this miserably.i come from a very abusive family. my parents have done a lot that's really fucked up the ways that i think about myself...i constantly feel like i have no control over my life. it's like everything i see reminds me of some past trauma. it seems like all the help online is "all situations change" but i don't think my mental state will ever change. it's just becoming too much to cope with. i just feel like i'm done living and i don't want to have to deal with all of these bad thoughts inside my head any longer. the only reasons i haven't killed myself yet is because i have a boyfriend who is the nicest, sweetest guy on the planet, and i love him so much, and i'm worried that if i kill myself he'll kill himself too. my parents, who are manipulative and narcissistic and believe they can do no wrong, will never blame themselves, and they'll probably blame my boyfriends and my friends and make them feel responsible. but another part of me knows that my friends will protect my boyfriend and that all of them will know my parents are responsible... i just feel like i never have any freedom or any chance to make choices about my life, and this would finally be my escape from all of this. edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. honestly posting this and talking about how i was feeling with some people close to me really helped me feel better. i'm feeling much better today thanks to all of you wonderful people. i hope you all have a great day, and i hope anyone reading this who felt like i did yesterday feels better too.	❤️
i'm mad but proud at my self so it's been 4 months since i've cut but tonight, my depression was really bad and i couldn't take it. so i cut	😔
my final goodbyeit's come to my realization recently there is an almost zero chance that i will ever have the life that i've been trying to manifest for the last decade and i'm simply not okay with that. i'm no closer to success today than i was 20 years ago and i'm not going to spend the rest of my life hoping and praying and visualizing that a life that is tolerable will somehow magically happen to me. it's become painfully clear that visualization is bullshit. i am so tired of struggling. always having nothing. i've been in debt literally my entire adult life. even with two bankruptcies i can't seem to get my shit together. every time i try something new to dig my way out it goes to hell. constant repeated failure really is no longer acceptable to me. i will no longer live with debt that cannot be erased regardless of what i do to try - i'm so tired of the overwhelming stress that comes with that - it's been literally my entire fucking life. i don't remember a time that i wasn't in debt and i don't remember a time that i haven't been stressed about finances. it seems as though that the universe has decided, without me, that i am not allowed to be successful financially because literally nothing works out for me regardless how much i want it or how hard i try for it. about a year ago i had what i would call a spiritual awakening. a realization that we are all connected and that our consciousness is eternal but our time here on earth is only temporary. i believe we choose our lives before we get here and everybody has a mission that is spelled out before we're born. the bonds we create on earth are actually created long before we're ever even conceived. we all have a pre-destine mission in life and the universe will push us in a the direction we need to go but we are given free will in order to achieve your life mission. i've had a lot of amazing opportunities in my life, many of which i have completely fucked up beyond what i can ever recover from. i've done stupid things, said stupid things and i've hurt people that i was supposed to walk this life with. it's unfortunate because i know i could have achieved great things with the right partner and proper support. i just got tired of waiting and too proud to ask for more help at this point. time for a reset. please also know that there is absolutely nothing that anybody close to me could've done to prevent this - literally nothing - so you have absolutely no reason to feel bad or have any thought of "i should've or could've or would've" done something had i only known how bad he was. i'm so sorry to my family and friends and mostly my nephews. i promise that no matter what i will always look out for all of you from the other side. i love you r ps please do not have a funeral for me. i don't want anyones money spent on a ridiculous party to celebrate a failed life. also, i wouldn't bother dealing with the cra or the bankruptcy. you'll only find insurmountably crushing debt that's pretty much un-erasable anyway... believe me i've tried. i'm so sorry if my passing has caused any financial strain to anybody. i have nothing to offer financially but maybe you can sell some of my belongings to cover any expenses that come up from this. again, i'm so sorry. i just can't live like this anymore.	✌️
thank you all. but this is the end of the line for me and it's okay, i'm not scared for once. i'm a 22 year old male and i'm ready to go and be happy. just wanted to say thanks to everyone on this r/ reading everyone's stories and comments every now n then have genuinely helped me a tone and i've learned lots. but thankfully it's not enough to stop me from doing this. this place is full of such a brave and beautiful people and all of you are appreciated. good luck to everyone else who's fighting their demons every day and i hope you're all much stronger than i am. i'm gonna spend the rest of my money on food and alcohol (always wanted to try maccas chips with kfc potato and gravy so maybe i'll give that a try) going to sit at the pier and listen to music and try to enjoy my last moments. when i'm ready i'm going to calmly just swim out as far as i can and let the ripples pull me away to a better place. thanks again everyone. stay strong and stay safe	🖤
accidentally on purpose overdosing with pain killers this isn't that bad but basically my period pains are really bad so i have to take paracetamol & ibuprofen but i completely ignore the pack and take 2 of each every 4-6 hours for 5 days. it's worse when i'm sick like i am now cus i'll have the cold and flu pills as well as the others even tho it says not to. it's not that bad but i know it's damaging my body cus i've been doing this for ages as the only way to manage the pain. i should probably get some prescriptions for the period so i don't have as much shit in me. i'm only putting this in this sub because i sometimes think that i might drop dead in the night cus of all the shit and cus of the scars and all the depressing stuff on my phone they'd automatically think it's suicide when it's just me being stupid and not caring. this is pointless i just needed to vent. most of that probs doesn't make sense cus i'm a bit high (just weed dw)	😂
i hate my life... i keep having suicidal thoughts..my love life is shit.. i fell for one guy and he really hurt me.. now there's another guy who i'm starting to like.. if i get hurt again.. idk what i will do.. my mental health is shit.. i self harm.. i wanna be better but no.. idk what to do	😞
it's officially time to say goodbyei tried to be good enough for my friends/family/boyfriend and i guess i'm just not enough. i tried getting through this and all i wanna do is talk to someone and i did try someone i really love but i guess he didn't want to talk to me not one single bit i promised i wouldn't do it for him and i really needed him especially now i feel like he's blocked me. that i'm just useless or not even good enough. it's ok it's honestly ok i'm used to it tbh i wanna cry i've kept it in for so long and now wanna burst i don't wanna live in this pain and i shouldn't have to anymore if anyone truely cared they would just let me go i obviously deserve it, i'm pathetic as it is. to everyone this isn't anyone's fault it was mine for not getting the help and opening up i should've done more but i chose not to bc i was afraid now it's finally time to say my goodbyes no one does not want me here and it feels like my bf doesn't either. thank u for everyone who tried. i've taken pills and i've been harming all i'm gonna do now is sleep and hope i never wake up again. goodbye	😭
vent it out i think i'll end my life soon. my dear has it been a rollercoaster of a ride. from childhood i was destined for suffering. my family friend molested me, my family neglected me. my brother would often abuse me. i was bullied at school for being overweight and weird, all my childhood friends moved away and not one cared enough to stay in contact. the black sheep everywhere, even amongst others who stand out. i came out to my mum once about liking boys and she told me to hide it forever and basically told me a gay child was like a curse in her world. then i came out at 18, told my crush i loved him and he showed my most vulnerable bit of writing ever to everyone. so i had to come out to everyone instead of slowly. i suffer from chronic depression, it's more active in my life than normalcy. i'm forced into an anhedonic state, agitated and irritated. i tried to seek help but it just didn't pan out properly. then i came out as a trans woman and life took another major turn. i'm either a sex object or guys use me for games. literally, they talk to me, tell me how great and wanted i am and then poof! gone. i know it's sad but all i ever wanted was my other half. if i had them then everything else i genuinely believe could be shouldered... but i don't because i'm too broken to love. how many days i've fantasized about death and i tried, i really tried to die but failed twice!! i just want it to be peaceful and as clean as possible. now, i'm rather empty inside, i don't have the energy to chase dreams or remain hopeful. quite honestly, the pain is so physical it's debilitating. i legitimately don't know how i'm still coming to work everyday or even moving at all. this one guy, last year, came into my life and i thought everything was about to change for me. he gave me hope again. uttered the sweetest things and then just left me to rot haha. can you imagine you go through all of that and still life bangs you with a spiked pole. i'm not expecting a single person to read this, i just want to vent it out. i really tried my absolute best but it's just too much to carry. i can't even enjoy the presence of my mum and sister who've come down for the week. my mum's difficult and she has a habit of agitating me more whenever i'm out of it. i don't know why. i'm losing my shit with her and it's making me feel worse. i just want to vanish. to never have existed. i don't like this world and i don't want to be here anymore.	😂
sleep it off....just fucking sleep it off..... at least u get some peace for a few hours .....	😢
todayi've posted here before but no one ever really reads these things anyway so i figured i'd might as well post for police or someone to find after. basically, i'm not happy and i haven't been for a while. i can never satisfy anyone, not even myself and i don't enjoy any of the things i used to. i'm using the last of the energy i have to do this and i'll be gone by the time anyone reads this. i never anticipated living a long life anyways and i'm convinced this is the way i'm meant to die. there are so many more things i wanted to do, but this is my last stop. if anyone i love finds this, it's not you. it was always me and this is last time it will ever be me. peace and love	❤️
tonight is the night i'm scared. i don't want to do this but my heart hurts so much, my body hurts, i'm drained physically and mentally. i have nobody, i have nothing. i do nothing to anybody and yet everyone gets angry at me and calls me names and threatens me. this world we live in is so shitty, why cant we all love one another? we all have our own issues and some of us are capable of doing more than others are. you can't get mad at me for that and its not right to take it out on me when you've had a rough day. i'm sorry i wasn't enough for anyone, i'm sorry i wasn't able to be loved, i have tried, its unfortunate that it didn't work. everyone clearly has an issue with me, so i'll help them out like i have been all my life and kill myself. problem solved. i have many people i love, but nobody loves me. i can't live life without love. i'm depressed and the only way to stop this is to kill myself. good night to everyone and i hope you all have an amazing 2019, i hope you are all happy in life and that all good comes to anybody who reads this. i hope you find your significant other, love feels amazing. i hope you all get to have children, they might be annoying but they definitely are some gems. stay safe and i love all of you	❤️
advice please. hello. my names kayra. i'm 14 years old and in my second year of high school, my friend committed suicide and i have no freaking idea what to do with myself. she passed away little over three months ago, and i'm a mess. i get counselling once a week, i'm on anti depressants and i constantly ask my self what if i had said something to her or told her that we loved her, would she still be here? would she be okay? would she see how many people truly care and adored her. i miss her everyday and the thought of never seeing her ever again brakes my heart and i don't know how to comprehend and understand the fact that she's never coming back. i couldn't go to her funeral either and i regret that everyday. i keep having dreams about her and i keep seeing her lifeless and it causes panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. i wish i could just see her once again, i really don't know what to do or how to deal with this. can someone please just help me.	❤️
well i guess that's thatmy mom just told me how much of a burden i am and how much of a burden i would be even if i killed myself how i lack jesus in my life and how my bed looks like a nest i live in lol	👍
i'd give up my world to be in the ground with you .i miss my fiance so much	😔

no job. no skill. deterioration. friends are too busy with life. 20s, you've been horrible. why continue to the 30s? society, you suck. it really seems that the world we live in sets many up for failure. i've heard the bullshit of positive thinking and it helped me for a little bit and helped me feel unstoppable yet i'm always right back to where i am now. rock bottom. i lost my job a month ago; applied for a bunch of jobs with minimal callbacks. i've had a few phone and in-person interviews but nothing seems hopeful. my inability to concentrate and focus doesn't help and the transformed person i became 2 years ago (from depressed alcoholic to confident, fit, positive guy) is quickly deteriorating. my parents and sister moved out of state 2 years ago which has been hard for me to cope with. i can't seem to find light and i keep telling myself that somethings gotta give, but nothing is giving. i've always had suicidal thoughts but they were only thoughts. i almost don't want them to be thoughts anymore and i'm contemplating the end in sight relatively soon. this life has been a constant pattern that always comes back to rock bottom. it's funny, my parents and friends think i'm fine but the signs are there yet everyone is too busy with their life. thanks for reading and thanks for feedback on here in the past and here if anyone cares. i guess i'm not really asking for anything here, just ranting about what's on my mind and where i'm at. i don't see anything in the power of positive thinking	🤔
since i have nobody to talk to i might as well talk to myself. all i wanted was to have a family but i failed. just like everything else i've attempted in my life. failure after failure. tragedy after tragedy. disappointment after disappointment. i haven't looked in the mirror in a few days because i genuinely hate myself. i hate myself for who i am. i hate myself for not getting help before l ruined my life and hailey's life. i hate myself because i'm not going to be there everyday to see my beautiful daughter. it doesn't matter what meds the doctors put me on. i'm sick. i'm unfixable. i'm broken. the amount of sadness and depression that i have in me can not be medicated. it can't be talked about to any "professional". i've held onto these feelings for so long that it has became a part of who i am. i don't want to leave this world. i want to be here for my family. i want to see my daughter get on the school bus for her first day of school. i want to see my siblings graduate high school. i want to see my friends succeed and live life instead of just existing. and i realized all of these things can be done without me being here. i don't want anyone to be sad when i go. i want people to be happy. i want people to be relieved. i'm a cancer to everyone i meet and don't even realize the damage i create until it's done. i'm tired of being a burden to everyone. i'm tired of disappointing everyone. i'm tired of being me and i know everyone is tired of me too. i wouldn't call my death a "suicide". that's a harsh word. this is more of a "sacrifice" for peace. something that i was never able to provide to anyone ever in my life. hailey i will always love you. you were nothing but good to me. please don't let my death upset you. the time we were together was the best years of my life, but the worst for you. i'm sorry for everything that i put you through. to my daughter... i don't want to go but daddy is really sick. i'm not going to get better. i don't want you growing up hating me because of my sickness. i also don't want you to hate me because i took myself out. i'm in a lot of pain. the pain is only going to grow as you get older. when you were born i made it my goal to be there everyday and night for you. that's no longer an option. i will be with you in spirit everywhere you go. daddy will always be there... my parents... i'm sorry for underachieving and not being the son you wanted. to all my friends, a lot of you have come and gone. a lot of us grew apart. i'm sorry you guys have to go through this but i'm in pain boys. i can only laugh and joke it off for so long before i eventually feel my feelings. i couldn't have asked for any better friends than you guys. i've slept in all of your houses when times were rough and i'll always appreciate y'all. i want everyone to be happy. please don't be mad, please don't be sad. be happy i'm doing something right for once.	✌️
dehydration suicidei am going to kill myself.... slowly. my life is just messed up, and i think it is my time. i am emotionally abused, i have chronic depression, and no one believes me. wish me luck brooke	😢
im so lonely i'm miserable and idk what to do anymore. i need to meet new people but idk how to. no one seems interested in me. i'm at the end of my rope.	😁
i'm tide i don't feel like i have anybody to relay heartfelt thoughts to so i guess the void of reddit is the place. i'm tired..tide..whatever you wanna call it.. i'm tired of being the only one to rely on, i'm tired of nobody trying to understand my feelings even when i verbally express them as best i can.. i'm tired of feeling not good enough for my friends, for relationships, for my job, for my life. i'm tired of feeling up and happy and then the crash of feeling low and then being lonely after. i know life is about ups and downs but i'm tired of being there for loved ones when they're down and they're nowhere when i'm the same..i'm tired of being scared for my sister's health, i'm tired of feeling like i'm the only man in my family when there are 3 other's older than me to carry weight... most of all reddit..i'm tired of the internet being my only net between my current life and potential suicide..i want someone i love to be the difference instead.. i'm still here, i'll still be here.. but i'm very..very tired..	😞
tinnitus is testing me honestly...fuck this. i'm a 21 year old tortured male with several severe mental and physical health conditions that make my life a waking nightmare. i will decline to elaborate here on my conditions and broken life because it's too much personal information. it will suffice to say it's more than bad: others would have killed themselves in my place years ago. i've suffered enough to the point where acquiring tinnitus is pushing me over the edge. i don't have the means to end it anymore but i wish i had a way out. i don't want to suffer anymore. i aborted a suicide attempt a few months ago and i'm already regretting being condemned to an existence where i no longer enjoy life or have the opportunity to create a decent one. tinnitus took my silence, pieces of my sanity, and my last shreds of a will to live. i just want it to stop.	😭
this life is getting old. this month, i am contemplating goodbye today, i lost the best job i've ever had, at least in terms of salary, benefits, opportunity for advancement, etc. i have been lost and constantly trying to find purpose in my life but it has really taken a toll. i feel free, but very lost. i'm confused on what path to go down. wake up tomorrow to apply to jobs, try and let my mind focus on a plan (potential failure), or plan the end. i've honestly lived a happy life and i sometimes don't see the point of going on. this world exerts so much pressure on us. we all handle it differently but this pressure i am dealing with now; i'm 50/50 on if i want to face it. i love growth and overcoming obstacle but it gets old after a while. this life of constantly getting knocked down and trying to get back up again is not fair and it takes a toll. what a way to start off at 28 years old	👋
please distract me for a few minutes i feel the urge to finally say goodbye right now but i'm trying very hard to change my mind since i dont want to leave my brothers and my dog behind. please tell me about your day (or week)! i'll start. * i finished a great book which spoke to me. its the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson * i had an afternoon nap * i made chicken soup which i thought tasted great	😊
opened up about my suicidal feelings and all i got as a response was "ok "i've been helping a friend of mine deal with her shit a lot. not going into details but she's had it rough for the past few months, and i've offered a helping hand whenever she's needed it. but the moment i open up about my feelings and wouldn't mind someone hearing me out, all i get as a response is just an ok and a thumbs up. honestly, i'm not even mad because that shit was mad funny for some reason.	👍
"i'll be in the garage"do you feel it?	😔
how do you get help when you don't even know how to talk about your feelings anymore?what if you know it won't matter to talk about them either way because you know they won't change. because the thing that would make you feel happiness again is impossible? what if the thing causing it is grief, but for a person who's still alive? so there's not really anything to make peace with, just a big hole in your life? edit: asking for a friend	😕
suicidei'm so suicidaaaaaal help	😞
i just took over 50 excedrin. hopefully i won't wake up tomorrow. since i don't have anyone i thought i'd say goodbye to you guys	❤️
the pain never ends. it's been 4 years since this sadness in me has started. i end every day by laying in bed alone thinking how lonely i am and how pointless my life is. it's a never ending pain that i just want to stop. i dont think it will go away ever.. crying dulls the pain but i cant even have that. i try to get the tears out but nothing will come. all these sleepless nights get so lonely. having no one to talk to is torture. music doesnt help any more. self harm is getting harder to hide. i'm alone. these scars on my body just remind me.. i'm stuck. not a day goes by without suicide on my mind. i'm to chicken to do it but i like to think that one day i'll do it. one day i'll be gone and leave this pain behind. one day... i wont be in pain anymore.. "shorty dont know i'm broken inside wanna be six feet under fuck being alive"-bad dream.	😞
i have no idea what i'm doing in life, so i'm booking it	✌️
tough times sorry for the long explanation. i'm 20m from the uk. i have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now and i just want to see if i'm alone out there. my story starts from the age of 14, more specifically november 2012. my mum is diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer which at the time to me i wasn't worried because i didn't know what cancer was and how deadly it could be but i soon came to learn this. after battling for a month my mum suddenly died when doctors were going to tell her that morning the cancer went to her brain a small mercy maybe. but that hit hard strange thing is i don't remember the funeral or much around the time this all happened which i thought i'd remember for life. so me and my family we moved to the opposite side of the country moving back to where we was from. great everything was going amazing i succeeded at high school getting the grades i needed for college. i was even in the regional newspaper front page. so i tried out college which at first really wasn't for me, this is when the mental health issues started for me. i'm not entirely sure how this worry came about but i was scared that i was a pedophile and that i might do something terrible it plagued me every day it honestly scared the life out of me i would stay away from children, parks and even kids on tv. as well as this i wasn't enjoy my college course so i left in early 2015 and took a year off to recouperate and recover. come september 2016 i felt amazing i shook the fear of being a pedophile and was in the best shape of my life i had lost 5 stone which is around 40kg i think. i had abs and was a starter in all of my soccer teams and as every boy loves i was popular with girls. this is were things took a somewhat nose dive. i had been acccepted to another college that was close to home and i went to tryouts for there soccer team. however after 5 minutes of the game i was running and someone came in from the side to get the ball off of me. at this moment i heard an almighty pop and just felt like my leg was on fire and was hopping. i collapsed to the floor in agony thinking my leg was broke, turns out to me anyway it was much worse i had dislocated my knee cap. severe pain for a while until the ambulance crew arrived and drugged me up. after this it was relatively smooth sailing i was on crutches for a month but felt great as i had confidence in myself. my life changed forever in december 2016 i met this girl and we hit it off straight away talking all night on the phone at all times of the day. this soon blossomed into a relationship. going into the new year,2017 it was the best and one of the worst of my life. me and my partner was travelling going places together and most importantly we was completely mad for each other. this was all great until november 2017. in november 2017 my partner and some of my friends stupidly (one and only time never again)took some edible cannabis. i felt fine for an hour and then i went outside and it hit me i freaked i thought i was in a dream and i felt my body shutting down, my throat closing. it was a cold night in the uk as we have it pretty cold in the winter and it's was about -4 degrees. i freaked out and begged for an ambulance the first thing they noticed was that i was dripping in sweat which obviously isn't normal because of the weather. the second thing they noticed was my heart rate was going absolutely crazy. my partner was sick and seemed to have got it out of her system. i meanwhile was rushed into resus and seen by a group of doctors. i was still high so i don't remember that much, however i read on my discharge papers that my heart had reached 180bpm and they couldn't slow it down one bit so i had to be admitted. all i remember is waking up in a hospital bed seeing all my family. my dad said it scared him real bad as i was attached to all sorts of machines and on god knows how many drugs. after this i recovered relatively well i was still worried about my heart but i had always had health anxiety so i put it down to that. things were about to get much much worse. in december 2017 the month after, i dislocated my knee once again and needed to be hospitalised again. however this time it was worse i was sat in a room awaiting treatment on a hospital bed, and i started to get these horrific burning and stabbing chest pains my friend shouted for a doctor as i was sweating a lot once again. they took one look at my heart and rushed me in for treatment this time my heart was nearly at 200bpm and once again they couldn't slow it down i was injected with all sorts of stuff i had morphine, paracetamol on a drip and medication to control my heart which felt awful. i was having blood tests every hour and being seen by a cardiologist. i was discharged the next night. things were okay for a few months into 2018 and then i started to get intrusive thoughts about me harming people particularly my loved ones and i just couldn't take this. i thought i was a bad person and was going to end up in prison. i quickly became depressed and couldn't go outside as i was scared because every time i did i felt not attached as if i was in a dream. this took a strain on our relationship and eventually lead to the end in august 2018, she couldn't handle my worries any longer and said she had to think about herself and not me, that she didn't want to wait the 6-7 months or however longer for me to get better. so of course hurt and heartbroken this is when the suicidal thoughts kicked in for me. i felt so useless and so low like i wasn't worth anything and i started to feel dark i can't explain what i mean but i just felt dark? we had limited contact after the break up to support each other but we just kept arguing because i wasn't over her and she was over me eventually she admitted it was all my fault and to be honest i agree if i was able to manage my issues i wouldn't have lost the girl who was the love of my life. fast forwarding to october 2018 and my nan who i lived with for 5 years was taken ill in hospital and unfortunately she rapidly deteriorated and passed away at the end of october. if i'm honest this still hasn't fully set in as i just can't accept the idea she's gone. and the present day, i feel absolutely useless, a burden to everyone, i gained all my weight back that i lost so i feel ugly and lacking confidence. i just can't see anyone ever loving me again. these intrusive thoughts still plague me i can't seem to get rid of them, so out of fear i stay in my house all day and if not anything else i just watch tv i haven't been outside for a while and if i'm honest i'm barely eating as i just don't feel hungry? this is why i believe it would be easier to just end everything and not have to deal with the hurt or heartbreak any longer. i still feel so so dark and that isn't changing, my sleep is non existent i sleep at 5am maybe for 3-4 hours even if i fall asleep early i wake up and can't go back to sleep someone please help	❤️
i just feel the need to say... you all matter. you can make a difference in the world, and be an inspiration to others with your story. those who bring you down are not worthy of your time, and although you feel alone, you are not. i know it's hard, but you have to fight. show all those sorry people who hurt you that you are strong, and can fight through! everyone is worth it. please guys. stay strong. not just for those around you, but for yourself too. there will always be people who care wether you know it or not. you are not weak, you are strong. you've made it this far while going through things not everyone could go through. you can do it, and please. stay strong. if you need anything, or just need to talk, please, don't be embarrassed or shy, just message me.	❤️
netflix shows i put on when i feel really depressed/suicidal or am having an anxiety attack (i hope this is okay to post here) these are shows on netflix i watch that, even at my worst, i get a couple episodes in and actually manage a smile: **nailed it!** a baking competition show where the contestants are all absolutely terrible bakers and the things they're asked to bake are ridiculously out of their range of skill. 3 seasons now, and they keep putting more out. **the end of the fxxxing world** a series of episodes about a wild girl and sociopathic boy running away from their homes together and going on crazy adventures. 8 episodes, about 3 hours if you watch them all back to back. idk why this helps. something about daydreaming about running away from my life and my issues? **dead to me** a crazy drama series, one season, 10 episodes. can't really say much bc it's easy to spoil but it has a *wild* plot line. also one of the main characters is velma from the live action scooby doo movies. **zombieland** movie set post zombie apocalypse. woody harrelson & jesse eisenberg= awesome costar combination *anyday*. posting now bc my phones about to die but i'll add more later and over time	👍
any advice? i'm overwhelmed with lifei'm currently in college right now studying speech therapy (which i really don't give a fuck about but doing it bc it "might" lead me to a stable life)and there's so much pressure on me to finish college and to successed...esp from my dad (he's jamaican, caribbean parents can be so tough some time) and he's pressuring me to go to grad school for this shit and i'm not really motivated to go through with it because im interested in the fucking shit. tbh i dint feel like i'm smart to be in speech therapy, then there's the lack of interest....which btw is a "great combo " i mean thrgh out college i changed my major only fucking twice...like give me a fucking break. now i have fucking online classes to do which are stressful as fuck and these asshole professor are throwing so much shit at me. just thinking about all this makes me want to slit my fucking throat. like i keep thinking about going to the kitchen picking up a knife and just stab myself to death. the whole point is i feel like i'm trapped and i feel like there's no hope for me or like i have no future because i don't k what to do.... i just feel like a fucking failure because i'm not doing speech therapy. plus i'm also scared about adulthood like getting my own place, a job, insurance, paying bills.... tbh i dint know most of this shit anyways. just thinking about this makes me want to hang myself. i'm just not excited to live life anymore....	🙄
why shouldn't i do it? tw:a lot of swearingwhy shouldn't i do it? what makes me the special fucking boy that would deserve to live? what have i done in my fucking shitty life that would make me deserve to live? i have no one.. literally. fucking. no one. it's like i was made to be lonely.. i want a friend that i can hug but that would be fucrking ridiculous right? who in. their. living. fucking. minds. would. want. to. be. friends. with. me? i know that i'll never get in relationship with anyone because.. that would be fucking insane.. people say that your life has only two main reasons.. to get married and have kids.. i'm sorry but that sounds fucking insane.. me? getting married? do you smoke? and have kids.. i don't even have to say anything about that.. everyday i'm getting closer and closer to doing it.. and one day hopefully i'll succeed.. i have train tracks like 500m from my house.. my dad has a double barrel in his closet.. we have a rope in the garage.. i have a higway like 2km from me.. there are so many options to choose from	😊
i am strongly convinced that my muay thai instructor committed suicide yesterday. i probably cannot think about killing myself again. i have trained with my private lesson instructor from 8th grade to 12th on a consistent basis then had some lessons during recesses during my freshman year of college. i was going to schedule private lessons this summer but then my father stumbled across the post on fb. from the bjj academy. the caption had a quote about weakness and the internal and external. someone left a comment saying that they were sorry that they could not help. i am convinced that my instructor took his own life. he was a step-father, husband, trainer, coach, and champion. and he is now deceased. one of the other guys who trains under him made an instagram post with a caption " you will always be in my corner." and this is what hurt me the most. some of you may not see it now. but if you were to commit suicide, you would destroy a lot of people. my father and i were not extremely close with my trainer despite how often we went to training. most of the chat was about ufc but he was not that interested in me besides that. however, it brings the two of us great sadness given how monumental he was in bringing me past my limits and how he has destroyed those around him. suicide should not be an option. i have underwent a lot of depression and i have been mentally hospitalized and attempted suicide before. i am not stranger to misery. but i will never think about self-harm again now. cannot say for you guys that things will get better. i do not know your situation and i would hate to bring false hope. but you matter somehow. always remember that.	❤️
