why am i still alive? why am i still here? i don't know anymore why i've still stayed alive this long. i feel so sad and lonely all the time. how can i be surrounded by people but feel like i'm all alone. 6 months ago i almost took an overdose. i can't be selfish always selfless i can never prioritise my self over others it hurts because i take on everyone else's problems but can't deal with my own. reminds me of a picture i saw of some guy crying that he doesn't want to be alive anymore, with another guy about to shoot himself stop what he planned on doing to comfort this other guy saying life's not so bad. why is this me? why can't i just stop for a split second to just priotise me for once? i feel like i still want to kill myself but the only thing that's stopping me is others. i don't know what to do anymore i feel like i know what i want but i can't not for me though but for others.	üò≠
i just need someone to talk to.. life's so hard and it's pulling me under	üòî
nothing hurts more than when you realize how much you really aren't needed	üòû
i'm tearing myself apart i need a girl to love and talk to and confide in i'm going insane	üíî
i can't anymore i literally can't even talk to people casually. everytime i try i just want to disappear. i just can't amount to anything. everyone around me has got a memo that i seemed to miss. everyone has got it. not me and it's fucking disgraceful. i don't deserve love or any other good things adjacent to that. everyone else had already done the things i'm just starting to discover because i spent my teenage years fucking depressed. how fucking pathetic is that huh ? i just wish i could fucking die already, but i'm even too much of a coward to do that. god fucking damn. why the fuck can't i man up for once in my pathetic life and do something right. i could go on and on but im not gonna burden you all. bye	üëã
i'm done im totally done with life i'm actually done i really don't wanna be here anymore	üòû
tired of the noise inside my headsince watching the ron mcnutt video from the other day, i think i've been given the courage to finally do what i need to. i've fought it off long enough, but i'm at the end of my rope. i can't come up with any positive from my life the last year and a half, it's just been perpetually downhill and i've reached the bottom. today was the icing on the cake. thanks to anyone who reads	‚úåÔ∏è
i'm gonna kill myselfhi, i'm 17 and i'm a girl, even though it isn't so important to know. but i'm currently struggling with my self image and school. i have no friends. i try to start up conversations, it never goes anywhere. i wanna get fit and be more prettier because maybe if i get abs and collarbones people will think i'm cool. i wanna finish school and have a future, but it's too hard to go there and sit with stomach pain. i always try to sit straight and suck in my stomach, i never eat anything because i don't wanna get fatter. i will probably fail everything so i don't even know why i try bother living. i wanna live like everyone else, beautiful, smart and with an education. if i don't get better soon i will kill myself next year when i will get my grades, then i know if i'm whorty or not. thank you for reading i'm currently seeking help, but it doesn't work.	üòÖ
this was posted in the bereavement sub. grieving myself and didn't know what to say. if you can help, please do! <url>	‚ù§Ô∏è
in advance sorry for my bad english. i just wanna share my story. it all started 2 years ago, where i ducks up my relationship with the girl i was sure i was gonna end up marrying, she was the girl i had been looking for! after we broke up, i started being inside a lot, like 24 hours every single day of the week. ( i used to play soccer 4 times a week, but quit that too) stopped attending school, cause why would i bother to show up. i got kicked out of school, and started to be a lot on the computer, started gaming, and that's basically all i do now, i've gained a lot of weight, until i started to starve myself, and in 3 months, i've lost 34,8kg. and i now weigh 58kg as a 17 year old guy. i've tried to kill myself multiple times, and failed every time. but this time it's totally different, i actually wanna die, for real. i hate being here, i feel like a burden to everyone, and especially my family, which i moved away from, cause i felt i put them in a bad light. my arms are covered an scars from cuts and self harm, and i hate being with other people. just had to share this somewhere, thanks.	üíî
i'm begging for help! please somebody i'm extremely suicidal and i don't want to live anymore...	üò≠
i found my pillsi just want to say thank you to everybody that said those kind words to me on this subreddit and on r/advice. your kind words have meant a lot to me but i know that i'm not supposed to be here, no amount of the therapy or pills will change that and i've accepted that. if i could ask you all to do one thing whether your someone that's depressed or your helping the depressed. please check up on the people around you even if it's a "hey how are you?" it can go a long way. even those friends that seem like they have it all together just check on them because everyone is going through there own shit and could probably use a friend. good luck to you all	üñ§
5 hours to kill gonna be in public transport for a longass time, if anyone would like to chat about anything at all, or just vent if you like, go on ahead . i'm 20, from ireland	üòä

is it selfish to stay alive? i have some serious disorders, most prominently narcolepsy. i'm 17 and i felt so lonely i started to open up to people, and make friends. i also have some pretty close friends too. my problem is that i'm just such burden to have as a friend, propably more to have as a boyfriend( the reason i don't want to get a girlfriend). while i can get better at controlling narcolepsy it will never be cured. i just want to defend people from myself, but i can't be lonely anymore. i thought about suicide, but i'm afraid it could cause trauma in the very people i want to protect. i'm too weak to just cut myself from people. wtf should i do?	ü§î
no hopethere is no hope that my life will ever get better, and probably even less hope that someone nice will actually want to talk to me on this subthread. i don't even know why i am posting this, therefore.	üò¢
i feel so overwhelmed with hopelessness, like i'd rather die than take my next breath.	üíî
i miss the feeling. she makes me so happy. i love her so freaking much and i'm so happy she's mine. anyone else who has brought themselves out of the rut, do you miss it? i know this is dark but i really miss it. i miss the sleepless nights, awake soaking my bed with tears, starving myself because i don't deserve food. the constant thought of pulling the trigger. it's all gone and i really miss it. i miss the pain, it's gone and i won't feel it for as long as this relationship lasts but i really want it to work out. i don't know i'm just a mess of feelings but they are all happy except one, i miss the suicidal thoughts, the constant pain of rejection and comfort of having a way out. i have no reason to leave anymore and i'm grateful but i still wish i could have it back sometimes. i love you so much babe, hope i never lose you even though i probably will because we're just teenagers and people change. when you hurt, i hurt more. i can't stand to ever see you upset and i will do anything to see you smile. you mean the world to me--- love, your daddy manager.	üòÇ
i'm really struggling hello to whoever is reading this i just wanted to say hi. this post will be a little bit long but i just can't keep going on without talking about this, also this is my first post on reddit so yeh sorry. so basically i started highschool being in australia, i had very bad anxiety coming from a public to private school i had no friends except my older brother by 3 years and some of his friends. i didn't really goto school much and it sucked a little bit, by a little bit i mean what i thought was a lot but in the scheme of things i didn't know what was coming. fast forward 3 years, i started to make friends and am showing up at least 3 days a week but i just feel like something was missing, i gradually slept less, socialised less and just slacking in grades. this went on for a while until, looking back on it the greatest person came into my life, my teacher let's call her laura. she asked one day if i was doing alright in which i replied no, i hate life and the rest i then cried for awhile, i never talked about my feelings as my brother and parents were busy arguing almost every night. having someone to talk to have me relief and i eventually started talking to my teacher everyday about my problems, this kept going for a few months until, the worst day of my life. i was called into the principal's office and he basically told me, it's not in laura's job role to do this and she's stressing for me, this fucking destroyed me, my only role model i wasn't allowed to talk to unless it was for class. i then realised that this was true sadness... or so i thought after that i just ignored everything for awhile, got into bad habits, i got to school but did nothing, no one cared, but at least i was ignoring my emotions which was good for the time being even though deep down i hated life. fast forward a year i'm in year 12 i have my formal, she shows up to talk to everyone and i see her there for the first time in many months as she is on maternity leave, and i felt find, after so much grieving, i then broke into tears and just ran to the bathroom, luckily she didn't notice otherwise i would have felt so bad, i already cannot get over the guilt i feel for her as i was such a selfish shit person, i didn't even consider how she felt, i just wish she'd have said i made her stress a little and i would've fucked off. fast forward to now it's been a few months since the formal, i am thinking about how much i made her stress over the months we talked, i stopped taking my anti depressants and i don't see a pych or therapist and my grades are going down. but worst of all, i really hate life. the only thing i hate more than life is myself. i need advice, i don't know what to do and i'm really contemplating suicide, i have been for the past few months. i can't talk to anyone, everytime i have it's ended badly and i'm running out of options, i hate going to school, i hate being at home, i hang out with friends but im just on the sideline i know it was a long post so sorry about that, if no one gets to reading this part all good, i wouldn't waste my time with me either	üòû
just a cry for help. hey, i'm having a hard time. my wife if 13 suddenly decided she wants nothing to do with me. i know she is out hanging out with other guys and i can't find date to save my life. i've talked to others that have had a divorce and they say it take years of this hopeless feeling, this feeling that i'll never be good enough. the idea it takes years, years of this feeling. makes me want to run a razor across my throat. i won't do it, i don't want to hurt the people that still care about me. but fuck! i just want it to end. any ideas on how to fix a broken heart. more than it just takes time.	üòî
i've done something that ruined my life storyok trying to make this as brief as possible: mental breakdown around january last year. went from an extremely heavy and skinny smoker who only ate garbage to a gym rat. eating, eating, eating, 4000 calories of the healthiest food per day, becoming strong and healthy. always hitting the gym. however: i get filled with regrets because the contrast is so huge. i feel like i'm about to die. also get so fucking angry at myself and feel like the biggest failure ever. i mean... who smokes!? who neglects his health!? only losers do that. self-esteem below zero. suicidal thoughts. extremely depressed. i contact my ex to talk about it. look up to her because she's 8 years older. i'm 28, she's 36. i start it off on the wrong foot with extremely negative texts like calling life pointless bullshit (fucking toxic behavior of me) she gets angry and i feel like i have to explain myself. she constantly says something i want to reply to and then blocks me so i keep making new accounts. one time she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so i make a new account one last time to reply with 'but i did change'... then she explodes. writes a message to hurt me as much as possible and says she will never reply again. says shit like 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... saying that to me in my situation is pure poison for my brain. it's black on white and becomes engrained in my brain. everything went wrong here. how i started it off with those negative texts and then tried to save it by continuing to make new accounts while my ex just wanted me to leave her alone. my ex also being unempethatic as fuck which makes me want to explain myself even more. her ending it in that horribly cruel last message... after that it keeps repeating in my head every single minute of the day. i'm so frustrated and sad that she said that to me because it completely ruins my mental health and makes me feel hopeless while she doesn't know the full story. the only thing that made me feel proud of myself is how i've turned my life around, but that feels completely in vain after her last message. i can't cope with it and constantly write messages and delete them again only to write them again everyday explaining myself and apologizing. telling her i know it was bad what i did. she never replies. after like 4 months of doing that shit she gets rid of her instagram i wrote a last extremely personal e-mail to her work, but she left that company so it got forwarded to her co-workers. holy shit. conclusion: i've turned into a stalker. should i kill myself? i can't live with the embarrassment and shame... it's also not something i did in the heat of the moment. i kept contacting her day after day. it's a pattern. i'm just a fucked up person.	üòì
i'm going to jump off a bridge within the next month or so. 17m living in dublin, ireland, made the decsion tonight i'd rather not be alive anymore sadly, pity because my parents and step brother and sister will be devastated but for once i'm going to be selfish, no more being a people pleaser, i've suffered from anxiety and depression since last september, i've bad back problems, a shitty hairline and 0 self confidence, i've a huge exam in june called the leaving certificate, depending on how well i do it will have a huge influence on the direction of my life for the next 10 years (or would have if i was alive to do it), and i'm extremely far behind that i'm going to fail, i'm terrified of losing all my friends once school ends, i'm terrified of being alone for the rest of my life (i am incapable of talking to women like raj from the big bang theory), heres a link to the offmychest post of what has sent me over the edge (<url>), i'm in denial of the heartache my family will endure but fuck it, i'm not living just to keep other people happy, i'm making this post as a partial rant and in the hope that these issues are pertinent amongst other people feeling the same way, and perhaps they may realise they're not alone. my nan died this month, greatest woman i ever met, and she's gone, i started self harming today, right now there's just lots of scrapes on my wrists but i'm not letting it get out of hand. i feel bad for my mates, it's not their fault, but they'll probably blame themselves. anyhoo, if this is my last post and i end up on deadredditors, hi everyone! shoutouts to bob ross, the rhcp, and my doggie gini (named after georginio wijnaldum), best of luck to all i'm sorry for whatever reason you ended up on suicidewatch .	‚ù§Ô∏è
will tommorow be better?i have been feeling empty ever since she left. i was only trying to better myself so that i could be with her and get ahead in my own life...but she gave up on us. i have zero faith in the small hope of me getting a better life in the future. i'm an emotional wreck who has lost his ambition to chase his dreams and nearly killed himself once. i just don't know what to do. should i keep going with the constant pain i have in my heart?, or just throw in the towel and give up? all i know for a fact is that no one will care when i'm gone. most of my "friends" no longer talk to me or help me when i need them. my family doesn't care about my wellbeing either, always leaving me to fend for myself, no matter how miserable i feel. i just don't know it anymore i want the pain to stop.	üòû
i'm about to	üòû
last night was going to be the night.i went in, determined to end it all. usually when i go night walking i just want to relax for a while. but this was different. my body clearly got anxious, as did i. "it's just eternal sleep, you'll wake up in someone else's body in another life and it'll be fine", is what i keep telling myself. but is that *really* how it works? i've been trying to overcome this fear of death but nothing seems to cut it. i'm definitely one step closer, though. i spent ~30 minutes recording voice memos explaining my trauma, probable cause of death and giving my legacy and my belongings away to the people that matter - not my family. two of my friends think i'm dead. so i guess i got that going for me. but i'm alive, the grind to "relieve my suffering" continues. not sure why i posted this.	üôÑ
i'm done i can't enjoy anything. i love with my parents at 23 and they hate me. i can't do anything right. i leave my job early because of anxiety and i feel useless. i have no friends. i can't enjoy people anymore. everyone gets mad at me for being suicidal. i'm gone. if i'm alive tomorrow then i've failed my mission. this was a long time coming	‚úåÔ∏è
my (31f) best friend (29m) of 12 plus 2 years partner is leaving me, i don't want to be here anymore i swore after my last abusive relationship that i'd never get into another. him and i have been best friends and loved each other for years, but we were too shy to tell each other until two years ago. we have a six month old baby together. he no longer wants to be a family because he thinks that it isn't what he pictured. he's schizophrenic but medicated. he quit his job yesterday and started staying at his mother's. he said he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't know if he ever did. i'm at a loss, i trusted him more than any other human being. now he's leaving, and i lost my sense of self worth. i swore i didn't want any more babies but i changed my mind for him since he didn't have any of his own. i changed my life, my future, my career, for him. i can't do this anymore. he has been constantly telling me i'm not good enough for him. i cook, clean, provide him with sex daily. i've lost a dangerous amount of weight (now 6'2" and 120 lbs) and he still calls me fat, says i never clean or cook (because he cooked and cleaned for the first week after the birth of our child). i feel worthless	üò¢
diagnosed with schizophrenia. i'm 16. hey all. as the title suggests, i was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few days ago. i'm only 16. i've lost all of my friends at school, even those who i thought i could trust. my best friend (or so i thought he was my best friend) told the whole school, and now everyone thinks i'm crazy and should be "put away." i'm so scared, alone, and desperate. i'm thinking about killing myself, i don't know what to do or who to go to! any advice at all would be very kind and appreciated. thank you. edit: thank you!!! thank you all for the advice that you've given me today, it really has brightened my day! update: <url>	üòä

cut off contact with partner of two years, ordered drugs online, i'm ready. yeah! üèªi'm planning to overdose on seizure medication and hopefully go out as painlessly as possible. i don't know how long it takes to get here because it's generics from a web medication site.if that fails i'm jumping from on top of a parking garage in the area. not really a poetic way to go but it gets the job done for sure. i was hoping with the pills i could die near the beach or in a forest? somewhere peaceful and really special to me. but beggars can't be choosers! i spent another miserable day at work to come home and be told what a failure i am by my parents again and have my mother insinuate i should try one community college class instead of grad school. i had coworkers tell me how ugly i was and customers tell me how stupid. i slept even less and i had planned to get a tattoo with an amazing artist but had a bunch of people tell me how ugly and pathetic girls with tattoos are. i just want my body to feel like mine to control, not the guy who raped me. i'm done making plans for the future that involve trying to use this life and body. i want to go out in a way where they can donate my organs to help someone else. that would be a really great thing i think. being able to give people the life i didn't want? my stepmom used to say "the world is overpopulated enough. anyone who wants to die just should." im there. i've made peace. and hopefully pushing away people close to me will ensure less hurt on their part. im also going to write up something that makes it clear i place blame and responsibility solely on myself. this isn't the pity party and i'm not going out as some weak piece of shit.	üëç
i'm 15 and ruined my life my only option is to die and i can't do thatso in january 2015 i found out i could force days off school then the day after that faked tearing my thigh muscle and managed to get a month off school, then when that month ended i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which made me have even more time off making it even harder to get back afterwards although for the rest of that year at school (7) i managed to keep an ok attendance and everything was working out then in july 2015 i started to drop off with managing my diabetes which then caused me to lose motivation then in september 2015 i had another month off school, that was the first time i felt suicidal although that didn't last long and everything (except my diabetes which got way way worse) started to improve until after christmas, in january i had another month off school which caused me to officially drop out in february which is when everything started to fall apart, i started pushing away my at the time girlfriend became essentially a hermit let my diabetes get worse and basically did everything in my power to make myself worse 2 months later i lost 3 of my 4 best friends (the one i didn't lose being my ex) then just preceded to feel sorry for myself for the next 3 months when i became friends with someone i used to hate who's now my co best friend (co with my ex) after that nothing changed until january 2017 when i decided to try and get back to school that didn't work out at all and i just got worse afterwards after that nothing changed until june when i started being even more of a wanker to my at the time girlfriend by stopping talking to her and carried on doing that until october when i started talking to her again in december we got back together and i got a job although me and her only lasted throughout december, in january i badly injured my foot which got infected gave me sepsis and nearly killed me (typical of my luck that it didn't ) and i quit my job not long afterwards in march i got back with my ex and i stopped pushing her away but still wasn't anything close to a proper boyfriend but between march and may was the best period of time i've had for years and in may someone kissed her and that was the "final nail in the coffin" between us in that way although we're still best friends but it got to the point where the last thing keeping me going was me and her and now it's gone i've lost all hope because nothings fixable anymore but i'm too fucking pathetic to even kill myself i went out to jump in front of a car which sounds stupid but still and i didn't even have the balls to do it and i don't know what to do because i can't go back and fix things no matter how much i wish i could and i can't and i can't end it but at the same time i can't carry on because i'm basically dead anyway all i do is listen to music and watch movies	üôÑ
still here didn't go through with it i'm still here i didn't go through with it. yet another failure can't even kill myself. i'm in bed now idk what else to do besides just hide. i want to die i just don't have the guts to actually kill myself. just feel depressed as hell right now	üòû
today's just been a hard day i don't know why, but the littlest inconvenience makes me want to throw myself off a bridge. i have passive suicidal thoughts everyday, but somedays they just become really strong. my mom told me today that i need to get out of this funk and apply for jobs. thanks mom, i didn't know it was that easy to be happy. i sometimes wish something else would take me out like getting hit by a car. for now, i guess i just have to live with these dangerous thoughts until i can't no more. might go for a nice long run in the morning to get away and disconnect from everything. :/	üò©
i almost attempted the other dayi had a belt, didn't feel like getting out of the house to get a rope. i'm pretty sure the ceiling fan can't support my weight so i tried the closet, but i couldn't find a good place to actually hang from. too many shoes sitting around and i'm already too tall to properly hang from there to begin with. i guess i'll just have to keep being a disappointment and a burden to everyone around me. *yay.*	üôÉ

life is going downhill so fastmy depression is getting worse, all my coping mechanisms are gone, covid-19 and all the isolation that comes with it is making everything worse, my gf is gone, i have a chance to kill myself now, etc etc. i see no reason to carry on, sure in a couple years i could make everything right again but that's so so so long. a month feels like a century, i cannot carry on for much longer. i feel very guilty because people care and i don't wanna hurt them but my sense of guilt is fading away as the depression gets stronger. maybe they'll carry on and heal? i hope so. i know the death of a love one hurts like hell but i really hope they live on and choose to be what i can't be. idfk, i'm worried but i'm sure they'll understand and forgive me and carry on. i suppose it doesn't matter, once i'm dead i can't feel anything including guilt or pain or anything. i'm sorry to rant u guys. i love u all take care	‚ù§Ô∏è
there is help right? i want to be helped.as nobody knows even me, i am a self proclaimed narcissistist. people hate those so i hate myself too. i'm very prone to manipulate people and i since child those like in the cia and fbi caught my attention. what i'm looking nonetheless is to 1) end my existence without hurting anybody. 2) seek help and not hurt anybody. i've been hospitalized 2 times, anyway i only do this because i need hope that i can recover. i have adhd and autism and depression. today i did a good step and called to go to the psychiatrist. all i ask is to make peace with me. to not hurt. i just can't hurt people like i have been doing is not fair is not good. and i need the help. i'm affortunate i have parents that take care of me. please help	‚ù§Ô∏è

a message for those who have been called "dramatic" i live with an abusive stepmom that i cannot escape from for several more years; if you'd like to read about that you can check out mine or others' posts on r/raisedbynarcissists or r/rbnathome it's not really something i'd like advice or comments on unless you've been abused and can relate. it's been a quite the day with the abuse as usual. i'm fuckin exhausted. the bullying at school was especially shitty today. my grades are going down because i can't sleep. i'm also sick so thats great. i just don't have anyone right now and i know i won't kill myself tonight but i don't know what else to do. *sigh* *teenage angst* because i'm just dramatic, right? people have it worse than me so i shouldn't be sad right? well, no. how does that work? we find the saddest person in the world and finally they are granted the right to be sad? no! we all have the right to be sad. i don't care if you're on here because your family died in a fire this morning and you lost 3 limbs or because you broke your toenail last week. you all have struggles that deserve to be recognized. and you all deserve to be happy. i don't know how to say "don't kill yourself." you can try calling someone who does know how. 1-800-273-8255 you all know the number. why call it? how can they help you? well. you don't know unless you try. and if they don't help, well, it doesn't work for everybody. i love you bw	‚ù§Ô∏è

i want to be the one who ends my life hello üèª i hope this the right sub to post this... at the age of 20, i went through 4 (failed, obviously) suicide attempts that started in my early teens when i was bullied in high school. by the time i'm writing this, i'm slowly recovering from a major depressive episode i had very recently. this is something i realized: all of our lives come to an end and i want to have control over my own death. no, it doesn't have to be right now. first there are goals that i want to achieve and certain things i want to experience, for example: * i want to know how it feels like to be skinny and pretty. i have always been the ugliest girl everywhere i went and for once i want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and don't feel like a fugly ogre. * i want to be accepted to the university i want to go and see how far i can go in my future career. * even though i don't want children, i do want to own an aviary with different species of birds, i may even adopt some neglected/abused birds. these are the reasons why i'm planning to stay for a little longer. i have a feeling that even if i achieve all of this, i won't be able to stay happy forever and that's fine. everything comes to an end. i just want to have the power to choose when my life ends.	üëã

i can't be alone for 24h without thinking about it i think that i think too much it sounds stupid i know. i'm just constantly thinking about deep questions like existence all the time. it makes me feel like i am not even a thing. i don't have any real close friendship. no one really understands me as a friend. i've never been in a relationship. i'm a guy in his very early adulthood my friends tell me i have charisma and i could go out with many girls if i wanted. i can't. probably because i was bullied and sexually harassed as a kid. i generally laugh it off whenever there is a crisis or a deadline i missed, because i can't cope with it. i got to the point where i don't feel like i am anyone, and have no past or personality and, like a future is not worth it. don't get me wrong, i really try to be social. but that only is a mask, cause i'm just in pain inside.	üòî
inner demons it's been 6 days since i left my mother's house. it was the hardest thing for me to do, but it had to be done. i packed some of my belongings and left the keys on her dresser. she verbally abuses me every single day to the point it made contemplate suicide and i don't need her negative energy around me. i want positive people who will uplift me and i wasn't getting that at all. there have been a constant battle with me and my mother for years now. her stealing my income tax check and trying to cash it behind my back, her renting out my with while i was out shopping for a birthday dress. i came back a couple of hours late to see some dude on my bed that i've never seen before. my clothes and all of my personal belongings still in the room. not to mention her playing favoritism toward my overgrown brothers. they are basically the husband she never had. now i have been in a women homeless shelter for nearly 1 week and it is horrible here. i get told when to wake up, when to go to sleep, when to eat, when to use the bathroom. i find myself crying every single night asking myself why is this happening to me !??!?????!!! i've contemplated suicide ever since. i feel so worthless i feel broken because a parent is suppose to be your backbone, your protector, your best friend, selfless and my mother is the opposite of what a good mother should be and this makes me resent her a lot. these negative emotions that i'm feeling is literally eating me alive. i feel so destructive to the point where i can't even find a reason living. i can't see a brighter future. i crave death everyday single day and it's just constant battle with me and my demons and i think one day they will unfortunately get the better of me	üò≠
husband seems to have come to terms with it i've been suicidal for as long as i can even remember. i've had a few attempts. nothing ever i guess whole hearted. 7 years 3 kids and a husband now and the urge is as strong as ever. my husband has always known about my mental health, and very involved and supportive the millions times i've gone on and off meds. always hypersensitive when he can feel that i'm about to turn, and trys to stay ahead of my falls. the last 2 years have been mentally dark for me, and october came around which is open enrollment for our insurance. i mentioned to my husband that when he gets the paperwork for our life insurance policy to send it to me so i could fill out and send back asap. he just kinda outta no where, and very snidely said they won't pay out when you kill yourself you know? fucking hurt. i wasn't even talking or insinuating or had even mentioned anything suicidal in a few months. all i can think is he knows it's going to happen eventually. i really don't think he meant it to come off as harsh as it did. it's just been bothering me since the second it rolled off his lips. on the plus side turns out our policy does cover suicide after 2 years with no lapse in coverage so . it really never gets better. i've made so much personal change in the last 5 years to try and better me. love me. all the bullshit people spout. i've got a full time job,college degree, morgage, 3 kids. and every morning that i have to wake up and fake another happy day i am that much closer. i just wasn't meant for this world. i wish i could trade places with someone who wants and deserves to live.	üëç
i still haven't gotten real help if you've seen my previous post to this subreddit, i stated that my mom refused to get me help. on wednesday, she agreed to get me help. she took me to a week-long suicide watch facility, but unfortunately, all of the spots were filled. she has been trying to get me in since then. it is now monday (five days later), and i haven't received any help. last night i started cutting again for the first time in weeks. i have thousands of scars all over my hips, and other spots that my underwear can cover easily. i've been cutting off and on since i was a little guy, only eleven; i am now sixteen. i'm losing all hope. i have started writing notes to my family and loved ones. my two brothers, my sister, my mom, my dad, and my grandma, whom i live with, are each getting a note. my girlfriend, another girl who i am still in love with, and my best friend are getting notes, too. i am still working on the notes for those in my family, though. they are each getting at least a page, maybe two. the note for the girl who i'm still in love with is already two, going on three pages long. my girlfriend's note isn't even at a page yet and i don't even know what to write on it anymore. but my best friend... i love him so much, man. i'm sure he'll be alright without me, though. he has a girlfriend that he can reside in. he'll be alright. before i reach my absolute breaking point, i will make sure to leave my final goodbye on this subreddit. i will keep anyone who is interested posted on how i am doing. for now, i love you all. thank you for listening	‚ù§Ô∏è
i literally fucking despise myselfi'm such a shitty person. i did something no one should ever do to another person and all i do is feel constant guilt. idk how i could hurt someone the way i did. i was selfish and so fucking stupid and now im stuck in the deepest run that i cant get out of. i just feel like i don't deserve to even be alive anymore and i don't even want to tbh. i know everyone says it gets better but i just can't wait for them to. i have to make a life altering decision and i still dont know what to do. no matter what i do it is either going to make me unhappy or other people i care about unhappy. and i just don't know what to fucking do. i just want to die at this point. i'm at a fucking loss. if you read this thank you very much for listening	üòÇ
no options, hopeless situation f/50-55, unable to get work that pays a living wage. sgl, no spouse, no family. avg housing $1000- $1200/m too old for roommates, drama. all adults need their own space. living with complete strangers, has not worked for me. i've lost money from trying to share expenses that were just not realistic at my age. i don't have mental health or addictions. once adults have imtimiate relationships, it makes for an odd, awkward, unbearable issue which is why i must have my own, safe, & stable place. people think non-profits and govt can save & solve economic problems for an individual, so they tell them to call 211 & other non-profits without trying it out for themselves, first. people offered me cherry-picked solutions that were not realistic. just glib responses followed by "i don't know what to tell you." i'm not lacking skills, education or training. i'm lacking an opportunity to work in a job that covers housing, healthcare premiums plus the copays and full out of pocket maximum i need for a surgery. avg healthcare cost to properly budget is $1000/month. that is premium, copay & maximum out of pocket deductible built in. people need money to live. i need work. i can't get work to cover my basic needs which also has to include healthcare. today, avg monthly housing is $1000 plus phone, water, sewer, utilities. i'm not a retiree, a spouse, a mother, a sister to anyone. i have to fully support myself. employers push out older workers. that is what happened to me. i don't want to continue to live if i can't get my basic needs met. i a strong, steady income. and i have been unsuccessful in the past two years i've spent, trying to achieve that goal. i don't see it happening. when your health declines, and you become ostracized, what's the point in staying alive like this? the counselor i saw for free at one of the many useless non-profits said, 'i don't know what to tell you, i could not live the way you're living bc i live with my bf, and i have income, so i dont know what to tell you, you've tried everything i would suggest.	üôÑ
suicidal , depressed , lonely 24/7. overdosing soon . goodbye .male ,19. always on drugs . average looking . people always fuck with my head then leave . i'm sick of this shit man . i don't have anyone to talk with . seeing people go about their day with their significant other just kills me. im struggling to see the point in living anymore . just feel empty , depressed , suicidal . can't be bothered to do anything anymore . first thought i have when i wake up is " fuck i want to die ". i've learnt that people really don't want anything to do with someone like myself . people like me will more than likely always be alone in life . i'm not sure where this post is going , but if anyone reads this all i'm asking is that you guys be there for one another . strangers , family , pets etc . i've just taken roughly 20 oxys, 32 ,2mg xanax and i'm drinking some beer and liquor . knowing i'm not waking up from this brings me a sense of peace and tranquility. love you all , stay strong , keep your loved ones close and don't give up the fight . we all have our own demons , not all of us can win the fight but try your best . i've tried my hardest but i couldn't do it. goodbye everyone .	üñ§

17 year relationship ended by suicidemy life partner of 17 years lost his battle with depression 7 weeks ago. he hung himself in our garage and i found him. his depression has always been manageable with a few dark clouds here and there. i never saw this coming in a million years. we had a beautiful life together. my reason for posting in this thread is now i'm having similar feelings that i don't want to live anymore. i've done a bunch of research and there is a term for what i'm feeling called "widowhood effect". i am wanting to end my life but don't even know where to start. i have looked up a lot of different methods but the one that stands out most for me is inert gas asphyxiation with nitrogen (suicide bag) or charcoal burning. i hate that my life has come to this but i miss my partner too much to care anymore. i just want it all to end but don't know where to begin. sigh!	üòî
scrambled mindfirst let me start by introducing myself, i'm 15 years old and go to a boarding school, last year around mid october i stopped smoking synthetic weed for good after 9 months of everyday use. i was suspended because of it from school and the drug has ruined my brain, in the next paragraph i'm going to say what i feel like right now a year later and if you could include in your comments which parts are normal parts of puberty and which parts are not normal, also advice would be helpful . so far i feel less detached from reality but still very detached, it's as if everything is fake, i can't socialise any more unless i analyse the persons body language and i'm still not good because i'm still learning how to socialise from scratch, it's as if i'm a baby. i feel no hope in life because my brain is so fucked, i have the sense that in my mid twenties i'll end up killing myself because i would have made it no where in life, i also have no empathy any more, what used to anger me doesn't, i'm emotionally flat in other words. i have conversations in my head with more than one conscious, also my personality can change based on the situation, basically i negotiate with the consciousness in my head and depending on the situation one can take over. people in my school are also psychopaths and keep using there body language to manipulate my subconscious into thinking bad things so i do what they want without them having to talk... this doesn't help either, i've replaced my sythetic weed hole with exercise, mdma and alcohol. also i can hear things in my head sometimes and be in a very bad mood randomly then in s good mood, i am also eating a lot more healthy to try detox. no one knows about this. this is the first time i've told people since i'm anonymous. if you got through this long paragraph thank you for your time and decent comments will be valued and read,	üòä
i hate to say this but i really just wanna blow my brains out.it's good i don't own a gun because if i did i would have killed myself so long ago, i'm sick of living this miserable life, i just want out.	üòî

everything i'm sorry for being so obnoxious. i'm sorry for always being in the way. i'm sorry for talking. i'm sorry for bothering you. i'm sorry for acting like i knew what i was doing. i'm sorry for being a liar. i'm sorry for not understanding. i'm sorry for everything. my life could be a lot worse than it is but i feel as if it's been living hell. i'm growing up as a failure, knowing that i have no future and that i serve no purpose on earth. i try my best to live everyday but things are difficult. i try to just smile, be happy, and ignore the feelings but i realize that i'm just lying to myself. i can't just keep trying to make everyone around me happy. what i'm trying to say is, i give up. i give up on life, even if i continue living i'm not going to try to make things better. i know that nothing will change for me, everything will just get worse. eventually i'll be an adult, unable to hold a job and too poor to afford medication. at least i'm not there yet, but...i should stop burdening people. i should just stop depending on people and just go fail on my own. at least then no one would have to deal with me. im exhausted....and anxious...and i feel like im fake.. maybe i'll look better if i lose more weight.. i don't want to get hurt. it fucking hurts. hours fucking hours spent in the damn room only be allowed to repeat the same fucking phrases. i get nothing. nothing. just do what he says. whatever he wants me to do. i hate it. he cut my hair and makes me feel so much more dysphoric. i can't. i've been once. once and i can't take it. i wanna die lol my parents told me that people who are amab (they said men but i'm being inclusive) don't deal with sexual assault or rape because they are the ones who do it. they say that i'm a liar and that it was not possible, they say just because i think i'm a girl doesn't mean that it has happened. they don't let me talk about it when i'm affected most by it. i'm treated as if nothing has ever happened. i don't know how to feel anymore. the more i'm told it doesn't happen the more i start telling myself that it never happened. maybe that's better to just pretend nothing ever happened, but it will always take me to a dark place. i'll never talk about it again. no matter what anyone tells me, i still feel the same. they tell me that pain is pain, and that just because other people have it worse doesn't mean that my struggles are irrelevant. i think they're lying. what gives me the right to even think that i'm suffering? i don't deserve to have help from people or to even have the feelings i do. i should just shut up and live my petty little life. what the fuck do i have left?? everyone fucking betrays me no one really gives two shits! why? why? why the fuck am i like this?? why can't people treat me right?? everything is so fucking screwed up. everything should just disappear! i want to fucking tear everything apart! why cant everyone just drop dead?? stop telling me its my fault. stop telling me to change. stop pretending like everything is good. your all fucking liars!! go to hell fucking go to hell! why the fuck do you think i turned out this way?? why the fuck do you think i'm so messed up?? it's your fault. it's fucking your fault. i'm used to being told i look gross. i know i do, i can't always wear makeup to cover it up. that's why i always wear a mask so no on will have to see it. so i don't have to see it. the pain is still there, i don't need reminders of how i look. *when i get upset about it i just tell myself that i'm like a real life todoroki but without the superpowers. if only i was hot like todoroki.* i'm used to being told i'm fake. accepting my disorders has been difficult enough, i don't need more people telling me that i'm lying and that i'm making others look bad. those people are helping me, because they know what it's like living like i am. none of this is easy and it's very real. sometimes it's too much for me to handle so i break down. i'm used to being told i'm creepy. it doesn't matter how high the dose of anti-psychotics is, i will never not suffer. i will always have delusions, i can't stop them or get rid of them. i hate it, you really think i like it?! i don't. i've lived with it my whole life. i want it all to change, i wish that i didn't have to deal with myself or my mind. i will always do what i want, how i want, in a way that makes sense to me. i'm used to being looked down upon by everyone. i'll never be smart, in any way shape or form. i can't do normal things like everyone else. i'm not even really living, i haven't been alive since i was little. people are always disgusted by my existence, they look at me like at least i'm not her. they avoid me and talk to me as if i'm a little kid. i'm used to not being wanted. everyone wants me to be gone, the only people who like me are online. i'm not planning on dying because i still have 5 years of having hope. i don't have friends or a family that cares for me. i'm on my own. i'm aware of that, so right now in this moment, i'm grateful i have something left. i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar i've never been able to tell real from fake. so this is probably the same, everything is just made up in my head because i couldn't just believe that i was like the other girls. i'm just deceiving myself and everyone's playing along. *nothing has happened you just want attention it's all lies you tell yourself you're just faking you make all of us look bad* people just don't want to tell you that you're just dreaming. you just want to be someone you're not. maybe you should just kill yourself to make up for all the people you cause problems for. you seem to have funning cutting. so go do it. i don't want to fall apart again *i need help* i am stupid i am annoying i am a burden i am a waste of space i am a liar i am fake i should cut i should die i should not exist i should be forgotten its my fault its all my fault i ruin everything i really really really need to die, it doesn't matter to people whether i'm dead or alive because why would it matter? no one really cares, why would anyone care? i can't do this anymore. eventually everyone will forget about me, i'll forget everyone. everyone's faces will become obscure and i'll be alone again. who am i kidding? i've always been alone. smile	üôÉ
ahhh jeez. ok so literally don't know what to do so i'm posting it here. i'm happy and doing really well atm. but it's so weird because just randomly at different times of the day i just get like a sudden urge that wants me to kill myself. i don't feel suicidal because i'm doing good but i'm still getting these urges that want me to act up on them. i think impulsively so a lot of the times i act on impulsive decisions so i'm scared that one day this urge might become an impulsive decision that i could actually do. i'm not sure if that makes since	üò≠
i can't anymorei literally can't even talk to people casually. everytime i try i just want to disappear. i just can't amount to anything. everyone around me has got a memo that i seemed to miss. everyone has got it. not me and it's fucking disgraceful. i don't deserve love or any other good things adjacent to that. everyone else had already done the things i'm just starting to discover because i spent my teenage years fucking depressed. how fucking pathetic is that huh ? i just wish i could fucking die already, but i'm even too much of a coward to do that. god fucking damn. why the fuck can't i man up for once in my pathetic life and do something right. i could go on and on but im not gonna burden you all. bye	üëã

gonna try to make my last memories warm and fuzzyi want friday to be my last birthday. my whole life has been leading up to this moment, pure misery in its entirety and me too much of a coward to go through with it. abused, neglected, hated, alone. my body is scarred, mind empty, heart broken. and i think i've found the ideal time to finish it off. my two best friends will be there hopefully, it'll be just us since the pandemic, which is fine, since they're the only two people i really care about deep down. i love them more than anything, but their love for me can't hold back the tide of unrelenting hate that i have for myself. i feel so horrible for hurting them, they both struggle with ideation and one attempted recently. it's likely i might inspire them to try again. but if anything, in my dark twisted mind i feel like a suicide together would be the greatest way to display our love for each other, even if it wasn't all at once. but i'm to much of a coward to ask if they want to form a pact, so i guess i'll just have to imagine. so i plan on spending that evening together, giving them both a kiss and hug before they leave, and once they're gone, i'm gonna upload video of a song i wrote, a kind of note for anyone that needs to know why. after that... [specific method redacted]. i might mix it with something to make it a bit more palatable, but it's more than enough to kill me. i have a sad playlist lined up, so i can vibe before i slowly become delirious, throw up a bunch, pass out and have my heart stop, or at least go into aggressive liver failure. it'll be quite fast, all things considered, though still take a while before i'm unconscious. but at least i'll be far too delirious to be in any pain or panic and to call for help like i did at my last attempt. it'll be a tragedy for sure, and i pity anyone who has to come deal with my corpse. i'm gonna set my phone to autodial 911 the next morning so at least i don't rot or anything. but all in all it'll be a great way to end the year, and my life, and my own sad song	‚ù§Ô∏è

just got out of the er for the second time in the past week last night. i was raped last week, on top of everything else i was already dealing with. the hospital i've been taken to has done essentially nothing and let me walk out unattended and completely alone. i'm going to die soon. i don't even really know what to say. it's not like i expected something else, i've been abused extensively before so this is really just another box i can check off. thought i was in my survivor story but evidently not. thanks for listening friends. my self worth is so completely shattered that i cant see myself staying alive for longer than a week. they took all my pills at the hospital and i have to go to a pharmacy every day to get my scripts for the day. that's what they did for me. a major inconvenience. it's pretty clear the kind of help i need just doesnt exist here. i feel kind of relieved. i have a kind of motivation for dying that i just didnt have before. night reddit thanks again	üëã
so so tiredi just want it all to end but i can't cos of my family, why can't i just die. there's so many people who deserve to live and yet they die early and me a useless waste keep living. i would swear that this is hell if i believed in that. just soooo tired	üòì
how do you convince yourself to not jump? i'm renting a tiny room in an apartment on the penthouse floor/25th floor of a building. i read that a critical fall is 3x the individual's height. and 1 story is ... what, 10 feet? so in any case, i'm all good. i entertain the thought a lot on bad nights. it's the simplest and fastest solution to a lot of my problems and it's only a few steps away from my door.	ü§î

"i can't really say i'm in love with you" is what she said. this just came out of nowhere and i feel like i can't breathe. just a couple of days ago i thought we were still madly in love, now i'm heartbroken. i just wish i knew what went wrong. i wish she would tell me that i did something wrong, tell me that i fucked up, tell me i had abhorrent personality traits, at least then i could make *some* sense of it. but she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. she loves me but she's not *in love* with me anymore. how am i supposed to react to that? how can you say you love me on sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on friday? she keeps insisting that i didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am i supposed to understand that? i'm just hurt and confused. she stopped by my house the other night to return some things i left in her apartment, one of my shirts she had (she kept the other one, and this one still smells like her ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents i gave her for valentines this year. i don't know what i'm gonna do. i spent all night crying, i feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. it's like i'm trapped in a nightmare i can't wake up from. whenever i was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. despite all the bullshit i deal with on a daily basis, i always felt alright, because i knew that no matter what happened i had her beside me, and she made everything alright. i honestly don't know how i'm gonna make it through the rest of the year. the worst part is how nonchalant she was. she seemed just so apathetic about it. our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and i was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. but when dumping me she was so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. we were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to care. she said she doesn't see us having a future together; i saw us potentially getting married one day, i definitely saw a future with her. and she used to see one with me, i just don't know what changed. i don't know how to deal with this. without her i just feel dead inside. just last week i was so happy, now i don't know how i'm gonna live without her. she was the best thing that ever happened to me, now i feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. she said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. i don't think i could ever find anyone else as amazing as her. the only one i feel like i can turn to at this moment is my best friend. they try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but i'm a crying mess right now, and i don't feel ready to try to date again.	üò¢
:) i have no love from anyone anymore. i felt like i was really cared for. someone that cares for you wouldn't leave you in the middle of a barrage of suicidal thoughts. you were the only thing keeping me together, and i'm falling apart again. y'know, i'm so sick of wearing a mask. i want to be able to open up to people, but i've been fucked over too many times. i've got a broken heart, and no trust for just about anyone. even if i could open up, i always end up going into detail and it makes people leave me because what i do to myself is fucked. i know it but it's like an addiction, the sting gives me a rush. i feel alive for that brief moment then i'm back to how i was. so i chase it more and more. every time the day expires and i lay down in my bed. i can't sleep, my thoughts keep me awake. they scared me at first, if i'm honest, but they're comfort to me now. they speak of what ways i should end my life, all of which go from hanging, to slicing my own throat. it goes up the scale of brutality as time goes on in the night, and the longer i'm awake the more inclined i am to do it. i end up excited for it. fiending for it. sometimes i have to stop myself from subconsciously trying to kill myself. i say i want help, but i really don't. we all know it, i hate myself but i love the hate that i have for myself. if that makes sense. it's 3:30 am and i'm typing to distract myself. i really don't think i'm gonna make past 20, i'm only 19 and i'm already falling apart at the seams. goodnight	üíî
struggled with depression, anxiety since i was 6 i'm 28 now. so for 22 years i've struggled with depression and anxiety and adhd though the biggest problems are depression and anxiety. anxiety makes me afraid to leave the house most days, the only reason i go out for anything is if i'm with my husband or a neighbor or something. i also can't hold a job because anxiety kicks in and leaves me a crying hyperventilating mess in the bathroom. this feeds my depression, making me feel like a burden and wanting to die. i'm going to visit home in ny for a few weeks to help my mom while she recovers from a surgery, and when i get back i intend to go back to therapy and i'm planning to try and go back to school or perhaps try to find and keep a job, but can anyone recommend coping mechanisms until i can get in to see a therapist? my current strategy of "isolate myself and just play video games all day" is doing all of jack shit for my mental state lol appreciate any tips anyone can offer, and to those in a similar situation, i feel you, and hopefully any advice this thread gets can help you too	üëç
i just want to get this off of my chesthey. i am a 19 year old girl. i have severe anxiety and depression. also i got diagnosed with a chronic disease when i was 2-3 years old. i don't know the name of it, but my kidneys aren't working as they should. i am not really a social person and english is not my first language, so please forgive me for my mistakes. i am afraid to talk about my childhood, because i get panic attacks when i do. at least i'll try for now. my dad has a drinking problem. he was an alcoholic, and because of this my parents argued a lot. i heard all of their "fights" (no physical abuse!) (shouting, my mom crying, etc.). when my dad was drunk, he used to tell me and my mom very bad stuff. (he called me and my mom a whore, told bad stuff about my mom's family, stuff like this..). sometimes my dad moved to his parents (5kms away)(because my mom kicked him out or he wanted to go) for days, weeks, months and once for more than a year. when he was away for more than a year, he cheated on my mom twice and told her about it. it broke my mom's heart and i had to participate in the conversation when they met after what happened. my mom picked me up from school only minutes after i got there in the morning. at this time i was near 14. he was and still is a liar. we're living together but they're still arguing a lot. dad's drinking 30% less, i think. i really hate him, but i'd be hurt, if he died. i know he had a rough life because his dad is and was extremely alcoholic. am i a bad person for hating my dad? i don't want to be. :'( i am very sensitive deep inside but overall i have lack of feelings and empathy. most of the times i feel numb or pain in my chest. i've been thinking about suicide a lot for the past 4 years. this week i jumped from a 10 meter high place into the water twice. the sad thing is that i felt absolutely nothing when i closed my eyes. i was relieved. i cut my arm and my flank when i am so stressed that nothing helps. i am just afraid that in the future i will do it. i know that i am capable of anything. sometimes i want to hurt people physically, just to hear them cry. don't worry, i feel guilt so i wouldn't do such thing. i try to be a good person by helping others a lot, cheer up everyone i can. don't judge me, please. psychotherapy and the meds my psychiatrist gave me didn't help at all. i don't know what to do. i want to be more social and normal. i want to feel like the average people. sometimes i feel like i am going crazy because the voices in my head are so loud, i also have flashbacks of everything i did in my life. bad experiences, traumas, things i messed up. i overanalyze everything and it's so bad. i don't want to do that but i can't control my mind. if this post is a mess, than i am really sorry. i wanted to get this off of my chest. now i feel a little bit better. don't comment bad things about my parents, please have a very nice day and never give up! i wish the best for you.	üòû
hi... please help me :'( hi i am a 15 year old boy living in ontario, canada. i have one last hope and i want to just talk about it here... i am 68 kilograms (idk what that is in pounds) and i repeatedly get called fat everywhere i go. i get bullied alot aswell in school. just when i think school is bad, i get home and i find my my mom cussing me out and my dad sick. it hurts to live. i just wanna die but i feel it's not the right way to end these problems so i have one last hope... one glimmer of light left in my whole entire soul. please help me i'm crying my eyes out	üò≠
no motivation hello reddit, for the last few days i focused on thinking about my future and my plans. i figured out that even if i would visit a psychiatrist and started taking meds, things wont get better. people would still treat me like shit. (i think thats why i dont have any motivation) so thats not an option. i thought about killing myself few days after the christmas. because im still curious if something happens till then. who knows? some good things may happen (most likely not)and maybe i will change my mind. i was in a similar situation last year, but atleast i had a friend. she was always so nice to me, but after a while she got tired of me, and when i needed her the most, she gave me a big fuck you. anyways i'v started this year with really bad grades at school and the teachers told me that most likely i wont make it this year. so yea, im fucked i just cant find a reason why i should continue living. i hope that atleast all u beautiful people are feeling better than me.	‚ù§Ô∏è
nobody knows what i actually go throughyou think you know me, lol all my pictures have fake smiles on them and i cry myself to sleep so you really know nothing about me.	üòÖ
i dont think i have a choicei pushed away *everyone* good to me. literally. i have never known how to make new connections so thats not really an option because of my crippling social anxiety lol. its my birthday soon, im going to get a lot of money. i know where i can buy a gun and i think thats what ill spend it on. i have multiple personality disorders, i dont mean i have *a* multiple personality disorder. anyways, been thinking of suicide every single day without failure for at least 8 years. somedays its for a moment, other days its for a week. i always knew i would die young, and i accepted that young too. im not afraid of death at all so im not really scared. my plan is to run away, then shoot myself in the ocean, hopefully i wont be found and people will just think i ran away. a pistol is surprisingly cheap tbh. i have zero idea of what i want in a career so i dont care about that. my only dream is to make music and be successful enough to live off that. thats not likely to happen since i know many artists who are extremely talented but just dont have the "clout" or attention so they earn peanuts for their work. i dont want to live broke, or even decent, i wont be satisfied until im rich. again not likely. started therapy recently. its shit. they dont help. just ask a bunch of questions then say "maybe you will need to have a different type of therapy but im not sure yet". i dont trust anyone. i come across as self centred and narcissistic. these problems ive had my whole life. nothing *really* changes. anyway i know right now im not depressed enough to kill myself and thats okay ill wait until my birthday where literally no one will say happy birthday to me im sure that will do it. life isnt that bad actually (relatively speaking) , im just sure not living it would be better. lol i ramble too much. my own parents didn't love me, none of my five siblings does either. every time ive gotten close to having a partner i push them away because i know at the time they only seen the side of me i wanted them to see. i cant break their heart like that so id rather be alone. sometimes physical pain is the only thing i can feel, but going my whole life cutting or burning myself sounds kind of boring. i wasnt brought up with any kind of faith just a single "parent" who fostered me, started speaking to god this year, i can tell he has abandoned me too because of some stupid and ignorant decisions on my behalf. tldr: i suck as a person, going to buy gun in a few weeks then go missing. i wish everyone the best even everyone who wont see this chase your dreams because why not	‚ù§Ô∏è
unbelievablei made a post earlier when i was obviously in a very dark place. i received a message from someone shortly after and right away felt a little better that someone took the time out of their day to actually attempt to talk with me, only to read that this person completely ignored what i had to say and instead said "hey man, i feel bad asking this but could i have 50 dollars. you'll probably end your life anyway, you don't need it." like thanks man, thanks for making me feel even more worthless than i did before. he didn't say anything to even attempt to be sympathetic, just wanted to use a lost soul for their money. it just seems like no one really cares, everyone uses me...	üòî
i feel so sad about girls no one wants to date me. im a 5'2 manbaby with anxiety and depression. i should die because i'm a failure who will never succeed at life. im just a disappointment and i always do things wrong. i should just die. i should hang myself or jump off a building so everyone can see and be traumatized. what does it matter? they all have somebody to be with.	üòû

going to the shooting range tomorrowye. people on this site pushed me over the edge. have already been feeling extra crappy for the last week or so. yesterday i just started to feel like hey maybe i do deserve help. ... was actually supposed to see my doctor today for an appointment and referral to a psychiatrist but apparently because all my wounds are self inflicted i am not entitled to the same level of care as other people and "don't have a life threatening illness" so the tiniest glimmer of hope i had is gone. yeah good one üèº cya later world t minus 24 hours	üëç

failed attempt - my gun miss fired...i was all alone sitting on a rock at the edge of a cliff. it was the prefect weather outside and the moon was shining. i felt emptiness and nothing i've been taking anderall the past week and rarely ate plus with sleep deprivation i felt no emotions whatsoever. i posted yesterday and i decided to reply back to everyone before i went through with pulling the trigger. reading through the comments at the time i just didn't even care what any of you had to say. all of you sounded so dumb... not even going to lie. how are you going to beg and miss someone that you don't even know. i bet if i vented to you guys for couple weeks straight you'd have enough of my shit and leave me on read. anyway i still replied and i read through everything... why idk i love all you than i tossed my phone off the cliff and pulled my hand gun from my backpack. i sat there reflecting my life for about an hour than finally when it was dead silent and i just felt all alone consumed in my thoughts i put the metal behind my ear and pulled the trigger. this has to be some kind of sick joke... nothing came out i held my stance and just waited for something to happen. nothing happen... i instantly became so upset and i tossed the gun off the cliff and sat there all night crying.... eventually i got up and went back home. my parents were about to wake up and i got back just in time and slid into my room. i slept majority of the day feeling a bit better. i don't know what to say right now... i don't know what to do. i'm using one of my old phones currently you guys deserved an update. i'm working as a intern right now my manger is going to question me tomorrow for not coming in what am i going to say... fml i have the worst luck but i guess it's not my time to go yet.	‚ù§Ô∏è

really want to kill myself. life's been tough. i've had a fucked up shitty life. i'm a 29 yo male. from the uk. i was raised by good parents. brought up religious as a jehovah witness against my will which was not good. suffered some mild sexual abuse there when i was around 8-9. the dudes dead now so what's the point in mentioning it. plus the fact it's a guys embarrassing and hard to tell people about. plus every one thinks i'm mental anyway so no one would fucking believe me. never spoke to anyone about it till now on or offline. got picked on in school. was then groomed again by a older man online when i was age 12-14 but more serious with blackmail etc. got forced to sit gcse s i had no interest in at school. i then crashed in a vehicle and didn't even get a chance or anything to sit any tests as i was in hospital with several broken bones. just dashed to the side like usual. kicked out of home at 16 for nothing.i started work for my dads company shortly after but getting paid was a chore and rare. that's the only job i ever had that was legal. then my mum died when i was 18 which was more than hard. dad lost everything including the house and the will to carry on. i then started drug dealing to feed myself and keep a roof over my head. with the drugs came addicition. i may have partook in some horrible crimes such as kidnap and attempted murder along the way and caused missery untold. dodged jail somehow several times. things picked up i seemed to sort myself out at least financially and socially but didn't last long. i have had a major gambling problem since the age of 17 i've lost hundereds of thousands. i earned all this drug dealing not in a honest way. this all stopped shortly after and i'd class this as my peak in life. after that its all further downhill. i have been with the same partner for years and she's very sly. lies constantly and i can't do with it my paranoia is killing me. we had a daughter who i love unconditionally but i know she would be better without me, she's 4 now and i think i'd be best doing it now and not later so i don't ruin her life from my actions.. i'm in very bad health now and all the doctors and nurses etc just seem to fob me off left right and centre. i've been overprescribed antibiotics to the point they don't work. my lungs hurt and burn all the time. yet i'm getting no proper doctors treatment. it's not like i haven't tried and tried to get help to no avail. i've confined in family friends and my partner but they all just shrug shoulders n come out with some bullshit like aw no u'll be fine or some shit like that. i'm deadly serious about this now. the only way to sort my head out is to end it all. i'm just gutted cos i know it's gonna fuck my dads head up and i love him to bits. my sister's not so much they'd soon get over it. my daughter's going to be at an age soon when she's going to need a good role model and man in her life and i'm neither. my heads fucked completely i need to end my life before i just kill a load of people or do something as equally crazy. i have no real friends and everytime i'm with so called friends i feel like there all talking about me but i can't make out what there saying. laughing etc. i'm really fed up i know people just want to get away from me and don't want to be around me. worst thing is i've done a lot for a lot of these people and they just take take take. i'm disgusted with the whole world and everyone in it and just fucking hate everything. part of me wants to go out with a bang but i have a daughter to think about. ideas how i can do it please as i need to end this shit tonight or i'll just potter about like some muppet my mind's made up. i can afford anything needed to do it. thought about a big fat bag of heroin but knowing my luck i'd survive it. probably to like it and get hooked on another drug knowing my addictive personality. i swear i could write a fucking book on the shit i've missed out on here	üòÇ
i really want to die i realised that i can't accept the life i am living and too ashamed of how i act in the past, now i'm severely depressed can't get out of the room always crying literally just laying on my bed 24/7 my body hurts.. but can't do anything about it.. i really want to kill myself but i'm scared of ending up alive i don't want to live anymore.. i don't have any friend i can't trust.. even my family.. i'm so alone..	üòî
how can it get better if your life sucked ass for 21 years? like, how does life ever get better for a tranny who has no friends and has never been in a relationship before? i literally have nothing to offer anybody (and dont peddle that bullshit about how we're all valuable or w/e), so i'm basically that person you would only be friends with out of pity. and even if i try to make friends, i realize its probably going to crumble anyway, since i'm always going to value the friendship much more than the other person will. i've pretty much accepted that i'm unloveable, so i guess at this point its just trying to cope with it. tbh, i don't even know why i'm posting here, i always thought these subreddits were kinda useless. you literally just post some random shit and some strangers pretend they care about you, if you get any posts at all. meh, theres plenty of good websites with information on how to kill yourself so whatev i guess, shotgun seems best. just hope i don't accidentally paralyze myself, else attempt #2 will be real hard	üòÇ

reasons to not join the 27 clubit's my 27th birthday tomorrow and a few people have joked to me about not joining the 27 club. if only they knew that i have contemplated being part of it in my low moments. and so i figured i'd write a list of my reasons not to join it in hopes of helping myself and others who struggle. your pain and trauma is not who you are. even in the most difficult of circumstances things can improve. the love that you have in your heart will be awakened again. your reason to go on should not be dictated by the amount of texts you received today. progress takes time. some of the best and the greatest humans in history accomplished things over the course of decades. whatever mark you want to leave on this world can happen. you are loved and cherished by your friends and family, even the ones that don't have the emotional capacity to tell you. you have the power to make a positive influence on someone or something. your ideas and art should see the light of day. even if your luck seems down or that everything is wrong, focus on your body, your health. if you have food in the fridge, internet, clothes, an education etc you are far better off than most people in the world. try to take that negative energy and focus it towards being grateful, towards your passions and towards your breath. go take a walk, write down a crazy story about you achieving your greatest dream of all time and how you felt. **** side note as i was writing the last line of that there was a knock on my bedroom door. i opened it up to find two of my best friends. they stood there with a box of brownies and came to surprise me. we proceeded by sitting on my balcony with some tea and they brought in my 27th birthday for me. i almost cried. and that my friends is literally the essence of what we live for, to reap every second we have to enjoy the company of other souls and make every second count sending all my love and virtual brownies to whoever needs it	‚ù§Ô∏è

been thinking about killing myself for straight consecutive days and nightsi've been mentally ill since way before i was a young girl, now i've been feeling empty and i just want to end my pain, i always keep smilling but behind that the agonizing pain inside of me just wont stop, i've been feeling depressed for long time with me having failed relationships with my family and failed grades in school i think i was just not good enough , they say life is beautiful but for people like us , we're on a different page, i've been keeping my suicide thoughts all by myself and people makes me feel im alone and whenever i'll tell them i am depressed they wont believe and listen to me either now im searching for painless way to die im alive outside but im already dead inside if anyone has a loved one who is depressed make them feel special and loved because depression kills	üòî
life is confusing. yes i wanna die. i feel alone but at same time i have friends, family they do care but i don't feel like and i think they deserve better than me. and i been becoming a suicidal person. yes i wanna die and that's not because i m afraid of something but its because it's my choice. people need to understand the difference between cowardness and choice. its my life and i'm the one to chose whether i wanna live or not? i wanna have some terminated cancer and wanna live my life to the full extent for the last time. because maybe i'm not compatible with world or simply i don't wanna be. and i don't understand why my parents and friends have a lot too hopes from me and that's why i don't wanna hurt anyone. but that's so confusing.	üôÉ

i have no immediate plans, but i think suicide will end up being my only option.for years i've always thought that i would eventually go via suicide. i have difficulties with mental health, and the last year has just been filled with horrible events which have just screwed with my head. i chose to move to another country as a last ditch attempt to find some happiness, and then corona hit. now i have no job, no income, and bills to pay. i am lucky, in the sense that i have a roof over my head and food on the table because of my mum. however this just makes me feel worse. i'm dependant on my mum again, and i can't give anything back to her. i've never been out of work and ive never felt so useless. this just strengthens my belief that i'm going to have to end it all soon, because i've failed at life, and have just ended up being a financial burden on those around me. no advice needed. i just need a place to vent to strangers to have no connection to me	üòÇ
that's it i'm taking the pillsi am tired of feeling this way. i am tired of being a worthless piece of shit. i would be better off dead i should of done this a long time ago. i dropped out of highschool i don't have a job and i am going to be 18 soon. my family never understood the bullying, my depression or how there actions effected me. my family always has put me down and made me feel like shit but they are right i am a piece of shit. bye everyone i can't do this anymore.	‚úåÔ∏è

:(im sick of always pretending everything is alright. i cant anymore. i try to but i fucking can't. for a long time the logical part of my brain thought everything will be alright and there is no reason to be sad. my irrational part however was certain that everything went down the shitter anyways. now after the events of the past month(s), with my illusion that everything is alright beginning to collapse, both parts of my mind are in unison. nothing will be alright. absolutely nothing. i have ni friends. i dont care about my family. treatment is not an option. i wouldn't function in society anyway, so why even bother trying? im sorry if you expected this to be a cry for help. it isn't. its a goodbye. bye.	‚ù§Ô∏è
close friend wants to be gone from this world soon my close friend has suicidal tendencies whenever she and her girlfriend fight. two weeks ago, she sent me a picture of her, slashing her wrist a bit below the pulse. i immediately alerted her family: mother and grandmother. they found her locked in the bathroom, conscious and she was okay for that night. but now, she and her younger siblings are far away from their home, a plane ride away. earlier this night, she told me things aren't going well with her girlfriend. they're in a long distance relationship but she thought that person doesn't love her anymore, for some reason that she doesn't want to tell me. their communication went cold. she kept saying that her only solution is to kill herself. she sent me a goodbye, told me that she'll be gone by tomorrow morning (it's already 2 am here.) the only person who could stop her is communication from her girlfriend. because of their quarrels, she's thinking that her girlfriend doesn't love her anymore. i went to message her girlfriend of the situation to please reply to my friend, to fix their relationship, and to stop her taking her life. i did the best i could, calling her sisters the moment she thought of suicide two days ago. i told them to keep all sharp objects, toxic chemicals, blades, keep them locked and away from her reach. to prepare to call for help in an emergency. told them to talk to her, remind her that her family appreciates her. i feel so helpless, being miles away from her side. i'm doing as much as i can to do what she wants. i feel the burden, i want to save her life. i let her know that i love her, i care for her, i appreciate her being. "hi, i just want to let you know that you are worthy, and that you are appreciated by someone. just keep living please remember that your family loves you. your friends love you. i love and care for you." is what i told her, but she kept refusing to look at life because "so? all i need is her." tl;dr a girl that i love had issues with her girlfriend. she told me she's committing suicide when an opportunity comes. she's far away from me, i alerted her sisters but for how long can we prevent this. i'm doing my best to reach out to her but she doesn't want to listen to me. what else can i do to save her life?	üòä

hey it's me again if you don't remeber me i made a post like a week ago about my problems and now they are getting even worse. my mother isn't home right now so i feel like if i am going to do it is going to happen now. alone. that's what my life is. i just got in a fight with my only friend and now i am completely alone. no dad to turn to.. my grades have been falling lately. really badly to. i can't imagine the studying i would do for the mid terms haha. no girlfriend... infact i just got rejected so badly. no response from 3 girls. no one likes talking me. i usually spend my whole day after school sleeping or weeping since i am usually alone. my mom is the only light in my life and the reason i haven't done it.i don't want to move out in 3 years. i would be even more alone. i can't do this anymore i'm supposed to be having the time of life right now. hanging out with friends... playing sports... having a girl friend... having good grades, none of that is mine. i'm generally liked at my school but i don't think anyone would care if i died... no one, infact the only person to text me today is my abusive dad who my mom left like 4 years ago. i hate my life. i think i'm going to do it reddit unfortunately i for have any belts to hang my self and my grandma is downstairs so it looks like the only way out for me is going to be bleach i heard it's not the best way to go but it's my only option thanks reddit for being the only person here for me when i needed them good bye :)	‚ù§Ô∏è
fml, i'm done.i'm done living. i have gender dysphoria(mtf), i'll never be a female. i'm so lonely, hopeless, depressed. i really just wanna die. i don't know why i'm even writing this, no one cares anyways goodbye.	üò≠
my psychiatrist just told me he'd call the psych ward on me. i told him i had reddit. he then threw the idea of the psych ward away. thanks.long story short. i've had impulses where i'm really really close to taking my life and i told my psychiatrist about one of them. he then said that it was ok to have them and all of that. just now he called me up one day later and said he didn't realize how serious it was and that he wants me to be safe, he wants me to have someone i can call. first it was my mom, i told him that's a no go. then my dad, another no go, then it was the psych. he told me he'd call psych no matter what i wanted and that he was sorry for it. i then told him that i got reddit as my "safe guardian" and he backed off, telling me that it's great that i have reddit and therefore don't need the psych but he wanted to increase our talks from once a week to twice a week. so, thank you reddit you saved me from the psych ward where they're abusive af. tl;dr i told my psychiatrist about suicidal impulses, he wanted to call psych, i told him no and that i had reddit as a safe guardian. he said ok and won't call psych.	üòÅ

anyone else feel like they're holding out on doing things cause if they do do everything there's no reason to live anymore? personally... about 5 months ago i made a bucket list of things to do before i attempt suicide again. and tbh... im approaching the end of the list, and i'm scared. i'm scared of dying. but terrified of depression (which i have a serious case of). so... i mean... i guess this is soon to be goodbye? i got... nothing and no one. nothing but an incomplete bucket list that is. but remember this: i love you all . and thanks for listening to me rant ladies and gentlemen	‚ù§Ô∏è
i overthink too much. f14 i'm alone everyday of the week. i do online school, my mum leaves home and goes to work. she gets back around 6pm. the whole day i'm just so depressed. i have no grandparents to talk to, my dad doesn't live with us, i don't have any friends. i have no one to talk to. i want to kill myself and end it already. maybe on the 14th. i'm so hurt and damaged. everyone tells me that it gets better or it will get better, it fucking won't. i'm dying inside and out and i don't know what to do my cuts get deeper and deeper everytime and i don't know how to open up to my mum. i just want to give her a big hug but i can't because we aren't that close. i don't know how to tell her that i do it. i'm just breaking down in tears and everyday it gets worst and worst. i hate waking up and having to repeat yesterday. everyday is that same.	üò≠
i will be dead in november... my plan is to walk into the sea, why november? because it'll be cold enough to kill me then. i'm so far from done there's nothing going to stop me i've been waiting for such a long time...	üòî
what to dohi, hope y'all are having a good weekend. i wanted to post to ask when it's okay to cut off a parent. i'm in my 20s and live with my mom. sometimes she is very rude and has anger issues. as a child i was abused mentally, physically and tortured in ways. i was asking my mom if she wanted anything from amazon as i found a hat knowing she wanted something nice. she was saying they have the exact same thing at dollarama etc or home hardware. i explained the quality is different and i even showed her. she tends to say "sure" and be rude. i explained i've been taught to question stuff like that unless i see evidence. i've brought this thing up many times because she tends to make up false claims and give false info about many things and i like to check if it's true. i was explaining it may be similar but they don't have that one and the ones online are higher quality. when she's proven wrong she was being rude and said get a job etc. also made up some b.s. i was a part time student and had to leave my job because the hours were getting in the way of classes at uni. i've worked contract jobs etc. since she was being rude i decided the tv i got recently that i let her use in the living room i would take back and put it in my room. i later heard her telling and then she threw my nice belt buckles, few of my clothes and my property and damaged some of my things. she can be extremely childish. she threatens to break my stuff sometimes and throws or damages my property, yells in the apartment to clearly get attention and i still have nightmares from things that have been done to me as a kid. i was wondering when it's okay to cut off family? if i should perhaps sleep outside in the winter. if something happens to me my sleeping outside and i pass away i've kind of accepted it. as a kid i used to try to sleep outside in the winter when i ran away, just to be able to get some sleep. i'm just wondering if it's okay to speak to her less or if i should just start sleeping outside and find storage for some of my things etc. i've already donated a bunch of clothes and other things last november in case i do move out i less things. any tips on what to do? perhaps i wasn't meant to be born lol. some days that i'm having a good day, either at uni or just in general it seems like she purposely says mean or rude things. sometimes she tries to start talking to me again and stuff. there are only some days which are good and i just wanted to be happy. i'm wondering now if there's even a point to living. perhaps if i'm not alive anymore it may be better. have a great weekend positive vibes.	‚úåÔ∏è
should i die on my birthday that okay or hello my life suck as every on else who has subscribed to suicide watch allot of shity shit happened i get flashbacks mood swings anger fits bouts of depression panic attacks from flashbacks and i think i am starting to go crazy cause i daydream about a guy for the last five years we dated 2 years ago but i haven't gotten over him sadly i daydream that he is still here that he is my friend but in reality he has forgetting about me. that's just part of the emotional stuff is more from flashbacks from being sexually assaulted in a sexually abusive relationship that exist i swear different guy bad guy. i just sorta hate being alive inside it feels like someone ripped my heart out and it just doesn't go away that feeling. i dated the other guy to get over a guy but he used to hurt me sexually like i didn't wanted but he would threaten to cheat or dump me. and i had nobody else to care for me. so i stayed for 8 months i think that's why i want to die cause i feel so broken i've survived alot of other stuff like bullying and broken family relationships. i think its time to die. another probably is that i got the date sorta set up i want to die on my birthday i really don't want to upset my parents but their part of the reason that i am dying. i might get lost in a lake and never found i would have to delete all my online info so they could trace it back to suicide they would think that i have gone missing that i ran away. bad idea they might think someone killed me lol. i got 2 months to go i am gonna try my bloody damn hardest to live i am gonna try to get that diploma but i can tell inside my heart and my guilt that i gonna fall apart i relapse can cut my wrist i regretted it to be honest it's too hot to wear long sleeves lol. i will have to suffer to boohoo. to be honest the pain of people alive makes me laugh i think it's sorta funny when people say i am a failure i am upset but it's true i am pathetic my cousins are become doctors and i am going on welfare wtf is wrong with me it's so funny atleast i won't be missed to much cause i never really got closed to anyone. i hope i don't die i hope i could save myself but i lost hope and my will i just don't care i want to be dead in a way. i believe death is like going to sleep just without waking up game over but no re runs. would be worst to die on my bday i planed this in may my bday is my user. just i sorta accept it. i hated going outside to be honest what do i have to live for nothing is enjoyable which is super annoying when i was better i really liked food and dressing pretty and.playing sports i really loved to be close to people because i was assaulted. i liked being with friends but now i feel nothing i use to have a dream of finding a partner being in love having a job to support my future children i would have a big family and i would be the best mom i could be and love my children with all my heart and have a partner to share it with my own little paradise but to be honest i. don't give a fuck now just come on mister reaper get me death. lol i am not even sad i am just really tired stupid insomnia.	üòÇ
nobody else can stand me.. and i don't know how much longer i can either...	üò¢
i don't know why i'm this way my head is fucked and everything is going at it with each other.. all my thoughts want is for me to try for a fourth time. and it really is appealing. but something else is keeping me here. i don't have much love for many people, i've taken so many under my wing to try to help them and it blows up in my face and i get used. every. time. i know every single solution to other people's problems. but i can't save myself. every time something major happens in my life it goes bad. y'know, at one point there was someone i loved enough to try to propose to, well it ended before i had the chance. and i haven't felt that way with anyone else. every relationship i've had seems fake after that. wasn't my first relationship, to the person wondering in my last post here. but it was my best one. ever since my mom found my note, i've been on watch. not allowed to have knives, though, she missed one. i don't want to hurt her, or any of my family. but especially her, her grandfather just died, and they were really close, so i don't think she can handle another loss. my siblings are terrible children, they treat my parents with no respect, only worried for themselves. my brother lived with us until he was 23. but he was forced out, recently. he's by far the worst out of my two siblings. he stole from us, threatened to burn our house down if we made him leave. my sister is 13, and she only sits in her room all day and when she does come out she treats everyone like lesser people, she calls me terrible things. i get the worst of both of their torment. but it's so much. my dad works all the time, leaves at 5:00 am, and comes home at 8:00 pm. so i've never really had a relationship with him, which i'd like to, i mean he's my dad. but one of the things keeping me here is that my mom would be left to deal with these two alone. if it drains me, i can't imagine how she feels from this all. ever since i was a small child, i looked after myself, as i said, my mom was/is always dealing with the other two, i learned to make my own food, and take care of myself. dad never taught me to fight, so i taught myself, and i taught myself brutality, because of bullies. i got into a lot of trouble at school for what i did when one of them tried me. stomped his face into the curb. ever since that point i had withdrawn into my mind. nobody messed with me after that. every one knew, i was that kid. people had me deal with their bullies. either way, i had my fair share of girlfriends in school, i've never had issues talking to girls. it's a lot easier than the alternative. even if my anxiety controls half of me while depression has the other. brutality stuck with me, it leaks into suicidal thoughts. gruesome thoughts. i'm a danger to myself. but i wouldn't hurt anyone else. that's not my intention. i can't leave without a hoodie because of what i do to myself. i do a lot of community work. i help people when i can, whether it be helping people unload groceries, or moving furniture. people know me to be helpful here. that's actually the only other thing i get enjoyment from, other than the other activities i've been vaguely mentioning, but if you're here you know what they are. around 15 i stopped eating, for long periods of time. only eating the bare minimum when i must. then throwing it up later. i've always had issues with my body, which is reason number two for the hoodies, covers all of me, flaws and scars. another thing that happened at this age was my first attempt at suicide, i tried the ever classic overdose. welp, somehow i survived, unfortunately. 17, that was the age i got jumped, honestly don't remember why if i'm honest, i was cocky to the wrong people i believe. either way, during the fight, brutality kicked in and i beat somebody's head into a bleacher seat. after this i stood up and told them that if any of them tried me again i'd kill every single one of them. and i was serious. luckily, i've never killed anybody. looking back, i didn't feel anything during that whole thing. no regret for what i did. or fear of consequences for what i said. i meant everything wholly, and i did what i did because of how i taught myself. 18 is the age i went for attempt number two, i hung myself, in my closet, pinning the note i mentioned to the door, telling whoever that found it to tell my mom i would miss her, and that i'm sad i didn't get to see my dad more. well, apparently she found it quick enough to keep me alive, i was just dangling there, and somehow i survived. i remember the feeling of it, it was peaceful, after beginning to slip i felt euphoric. slipping swiftly and quietly away. well, i'm here still. and now we're to age 19, which i turned on october 25th of last year, i tried my last attempt not too long ago actually, it was 7 months ago i believe. i cut "down the river" and waited. welp, a friend found me, and i survived. after this i met the girl that broke my heart. permanently. how she looked is still burned into my mind, and if i'm honest, i did obsess over her after the breakup, constant checks on her social media. which i know isn't good for ones mental state, especially given the circumstances of the breakup. i felt my most confident with her, i had begun to pick up the pieces of my life, eating regularly, taking good care of everything. then everything was ripped apart and scattered, once again. so here we are, right now i'm sitting here. blade in my hand, going over pros and cons while my thoughts lick at the open wound that is suicidal tendencies. giving that feeling i crave, urging me to slice my throat and wrists. only thing keeping me from doin this is typing this right now. i'm at the edge again. it always comes back to this. am i meant to die? there are so many ways to do it here. easy for me to access. knife block in the kitchen, rope in the shed, pills in the medicine cabinet, guns in my parents' room, my knife i'm holding, i could bash my face into my header until my head is wide open, if it appealed to me enough. i really don't want to be here anymore, eternal rest is calling. i don't know whether to answer or not. i'm gonna see how long i can keep alive tonight, goodbye you fine folks. to be honest i don't know how any of you deal with me	üíî
it never gets better. killing myself in february it never gets better. i was back tracking on my suicide date in february because i knew other people in my life weren't moving fast enough. well too fucking bad. i'm sorry for the trauma i'm about to cause. but there is no healing & peace for us. i want just 1 thing to go well. if only my suicide.	üòä
last act i'm gonna have some fun before i go. i'm doing the world a favor by going but first i want to burn through all my cash on movies booze hookers etc. then i'll burn all my stuff so no one else can have it and disappear	üòÅ
some wholesomeness ive been depressed for years now and i gave up on suicide since i kept failing, i still don't want to live but i'm trying to make do while i'm stuck here. today for the first time in a year i worked out in a group class (kickboxing) for 60 min. i flailed around hilariously as my muscles weren't up for it and i'm sure i looked ridiculous but i did it none the less! and its the small wins that count! so just as i'm trying to celebrate my small victory i hope it helps other celebrating their small achievements as well! thank you for your time	üñ§
i need help. any nice message will make me happy really suicidal rn	üòî
to all those who feel like giving up:you have survived every single bad day you've had thrown at you so far. you are much stronger than the self defeating thoughts in your head give you credit for. there is so much more than the pain you feel today. you have so much in store for you ahead. life, love, happiness. it is all attainable i promise you. do not bottle up your feelings. talk to someone, anyone. let the negative energy out and release it from yourself out into the universe. hang in there. life is good if you let it be. take charge of your life. only you can change your point of view and circumstances. you are special. there is literally nobody who shares the level of special value you bring to the world. dont give those defeating thoughts or outside negative influences the satisfaction of winning. you are strong. you are a survivor. keep it up.	üëç
glad i made ithey guys. wanted to share this, incase it helps anyone. in november of 2015, i attempted suicide. it didn't work. not even close. i thought it would, and i was totally prepared to die. when it didn't, i felt a mixture of disappointment and relief. cut to: last october 2016. i was better, definitely better, but no where near close to being healed. i was depressed most weeks, and i often thought about suicide. this lasted up until around the beginning of january. until then, i was still healing, and still trying to just get through life. cut to: march 2017. i'd been feeling so much better. i was enjoying life, and for the first time in ages, i was enjoying getting out and going to class, and even seeing people. that's why i didn't see that tuesday coming. out of no where, the feelings hit me, and it was as if they'd never left. i was on campus, looking at everyone around me, feeling completely alone and completely done. i was determined to try again, only this time i wouldn't mess up. only this time, my boyfriend saved me. he talked me through it, helped me through the night, and by the next morning i was on my way to feeling better again. you know how these things go. finally, cut to: the end of march. i decided to begin applying for jobs (i graduate college in may.) i applied, and got denied, to many many places. i was beginning to get distraught, and i felt hopeless. at this point, i didn't know why i was alive. it felt like i had nothing going for me, and i was doomed to be worthless. (this process for me technically started in january, but i focused a lot on it in march.) a week later a saw a job posting for a position that looked like it would fit me. not thinking anything of it, or expecting a reply, i sent in my application. the next day i got an interview. that same day i was hired. since then, it's only april. today is april 22nd, 2017, and i am so thankful i was never successful in ending my life. this job that i thought nothing of, has changed my life. it is the job of my dreams. each day i walk in to work so excited, and so so incredibly happy. after my first day, the first thing i thought to myself was "thank god i lived." things can change. things can turn around. i'm not saying i still don't struggle, or that i won't ever struggle again. hell most nights are still hard, haha. but because i made it through, i got to experience this incredible opportunity to work for my dream company, doing what i love to do. it only took 2 days for things to get dramatically better. 2 days. it's unfortunate i suffered for so long, and that most people have to, but i just wanted to tell someone my story in case anyone else feels trapped in how their life is going. i think i'll always struggle, but at least now i'm happy most days. if anyone needs someone to talk to, i'm here	üòä
rest would be nice.i don't sleep. i live in a one-room bedsit. my mother hates me so i can't live with her. my stepmother seems annoyed by my very existence (which caught me off-guard as she's usually pretty affectionate) so i can't live with my dad. i can't drive, hand few marketable skills and the ones i do have are for things that are difficult as hell to get into; so what chance does a luckless twit like me have at any success? i've attempted suicide twice since september and i've lost friends because of it. i have no prospects and no hope, not that hope has ever done me any good before. that probably sounds self-pitying but i don't really care. it's not even that i necessarily want to die, i just want some peace for a while - sleep would be peaceful, if i could manage it .	üòì
